The state officials were absorbed in fun and pleasure, poets in descriptions of love and separation, artisans in zari and chikan work, businessmen in dealings in surma, perfumes and cosmetics. All were drowned in sensual pleasures. No one knew what was happening around the world. Quail fights were on. Rings were being readied for partridge fights.
