In administration, in literature, in social life, in arts and crafts, in business and industry, in cuisine and custom \u2013 sensuality ruled everywhere. The state officials were absorbed in fun and pleasure, poets in descriptions of love and separation, artisans in zari and chikan work, businessmen in dealings in surma, perfumes and cosmetics. All were drowned in sensual pleasures. No one knew what was happening around the world. Quail fights were on. Rings were being readied for partridge fights. Somewhere the game of chausar was being played, with its attendant shouts on the winning throw. Elsewhere a pitched chessboard battle was on.
