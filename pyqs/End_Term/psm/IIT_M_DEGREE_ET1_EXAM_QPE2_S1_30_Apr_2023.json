Research & Data Collection**\n- **Pilot Study**: Small-scale preliminary study to test feasibility, refine methods, and identify potential issues before a full-scale study.\n- **Sampling Bias**:\n  - **Twitter\u2019s 2016 Bias**: *Temporal bias* (overrepresentation of recent tweets) or *geographic bias* (skewed toward certain regions).\n  - Other biases: *Selection bias*, *Algorithm bias*, *Demographic bias*.\n- **Field Trials**: Real-world experiments to test technologies (e.g., privacy tools) in natural settings.\n  - Example: Deploying a browser extension to warn users about oversharing and measuring its effectiveness.\n\n### **2. Text Analysis Techniques**\n| **Technique**       | **Description**                                                                                     | **Pros**                                  | **Cons**                                  |\n|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| **Bag of Words (BoW)** | Represents text as word frequency vectors (ignores grammar/word order).                              | Simple, fast.                            | Loses context/semantics.                  |\n| **TF-IDF**           | Weighs words by importance: *Term Frequency (TF)* \u00d7 *Inverse Document Frequency (IDF)*.              | Reduces noise (e.g., stopwords).          | Still context-agnostic.                  |\n| **LIWC**             | *Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count*: Psychometric tool to analyze emotional/social dimensions in text. | Pre-trained for psychology/social science. | Limited to predefined categories.        |\n| **Static Word Embeddings** (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe) | Fixed vector representations for words (trained on large corpora).                                  | Efficient, captures semantics.            | Context-insensitive (e.g., \"bank\" = same vector for river/finance). |\n| **Contextual Embeddings** (e.g., BERT) | Dynamic representations based on surrounding text (uses transformers).                              | Context-aware, state-of-the-art.          | Computationally expensive, needs fine-tuning. |\n\n**Why TF-IDF improves with more comments (vs. BERT)**:\n- TF-IDF relies on statistical patterns; more data \u2192 better IDF estimates.\n- BERT\u2019s contextual understanding saturates quickly (less dependent on data volume).\n\n**Why \"Climate Change\" performs better**:\n- More **polarized language** (clear divisive terms like \"denier\" vs. \"activist\") \u2192 easier for models to classify.\n\n### **3. Social Media Phenomena**\n- **Homophily**: Tendency of users to connect with similar others (e.g., political echo chambers on Twitter).\n  - Example: Reddit\u2019s r/politics vs. r/Conservative.\n- **Context Collapse**: Blurring of audience boundaries (e.g., a professional posting personal opinions on LinkedIn).\n  - Example: A teacher\u2019s controversial tweet seen by students, parents, and employers.\n- **Information Revelation**: Unintentional disclosure of private data.\n  - Examples:\n    1. *Metadata leakage*: EXIF data in photos revealing location.\n    2. *Social graph inference*: Friend lists exposing political/religious affiliations.\n\n### **4. Privacy & Security**\n#### **A. Privacy Laws**\n| **Law**               | **Sector**       | **Key Provisions**                                                                 |\n|-----------------------|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **GDPR (EU)**         | General          | Right to erasure, data portability, consent requirements.                        |\n| **CCPA (California)** | General          | Opt-out rights for data selling, transparency.                                    |\n| **GLBA (USA)**        | Finance          | Protects non-public personal info (NPI) in financial institutions.                |\n| **PCI-DSS**           | Finance          | Secures credit card transactions; encryption, access controls.                   |\n\n**Importance of Privacy Laws**:\n- Protect user autonomy, prevent exploitation (e.g., targeted ads, identity theft).\n- Finance-specific laws: Mitigate fraud (e.g., credit card skimming, insider trading).\n\n#### **B. Data Breach Response (FTC/OECD Guidelines)**\n1. **Containment**: Isolate affected systems.\n2. **Assessment**: Determine scope (data types, users affected).\n3. **Notification**:\n   - Users (within 72 hours under GDPR).\n   - Regulators (e.g., FTC, ICO).\n4. **Remediation**: Patch vulnerabilities, offer credit monitoring.\n5. **Prevention**: Audit logs, encryption, employee training.\n\n#### **C. Anonymization Techniques**\n| **Technique**         | **Description**                                                                                     | **Attack Risk**                          |\n|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| **Generalization**    | Replace specifics with ranges (e.g., age 32 \u2192 \"30\u201340\").                                            | *Homogeneity attack* (if group is small).|\n| **Suppression**       | Remove sensitive attributes (e.g., ZIP code).                                                      | *Linkage attack* (combine with other data).|\n| **Perturbation**      | Add noise (e.g., age 32 \u2192 30 or 34).                                                                | *Inference attack* (statistical reconstruction).|\n| **k-Anonymity**       | Ensure each record is indistinguishable among *k* others.                                         | *Background knowledge attack*.          |\n\n**Example Anonymized Table** (using generalization):\n| Patient ID | Age Range | Gender | ZIP Prefix | Condition      |\n|------------|-----------|--------|------------|-----------------|\n| 1          | 30\u201339     | Male   | 123**      | Diabetes        |\n\n#### **D. Graph Analytics**\n- **Betweenness Centrality**: Measures a node\u2019s control over information flow.\n  - Formula:\n    \\[\n    C_B(v) = \\sum_{s \\neq v \\neq t} \\frac{\\sigma_{st}(v)}{\\sigma_{st}}\n    \\]\n    - \\(\\sigma_{st}\\): Total shortest paths from \\(s\\) to \\(t\\).\n    - \\(\\sigma_{st}(v)\\): Paths passing through \\(v\\).\n\n### **5. Ethics in Experiments**\n| **Experiment**         | **Ethical Concerns**                                                                               |\n|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Emotional Contagion (Facebook, 2014)** | Manipulated users\u2019 emotions without informed consent; lack of debriefing.                          |\n| **OkCupid (2014)**     | Misled users about compatibility scores; no opt-out.                                               |\n\n**3R Approach (Replace, Reduce, Refine)**:\n1. **Replace**: Use synthetic data or simulations instead of real users.\n2. **Reduce**: Minimize data collection (e.g., shorter study duration).\n3. **Refine**: Improve consent processes (e.g., clear opt-in/out, debriefing).\n- **Application to Emotional Contagion**:\n  - Replace: Use bots to simulate emotional responses.\n  - Reduce: Limit to a small, consented user group.\n  - Refine: Pre-study consent + post-study debriefing.\n\n### **6. Technical Challenges in Cyberbullying Detection**\n1. **Contextual Ambiguity**: Sarcasm (e.g., \"Great job, idiot!\").\n2. **Multimodal Data**: Text + images/videos (e.g., memes with hate symbols).\n3. **Evolving Language**: Slang, code-switching (e.g., \"stan\" \u2192 \"stalker fan\").\n4. **Class Imbalance**: Few bullying posts vs. normal content \u2192 high false positives.\n5. **Cultural Differences**: What\u2019s offensive in one culture may not be in another.\n\n### **7. Fake News Detection Drawbacks**\n- **Warning Labels**:\n  - **Backfire Effect**: Users may double down on false beliefs when challenged.\n  - **Over-censorship**: Legitimate content mislabeled as fake.\n  - **Platform Bias**: Perceived partisanship (e.g., \"Facebook censors conservatives\").\n\n### **8. Statistical Concepts**\n- **Variance**: Measures data spread.\n  - Formula:\n    \\[\n    \\sigma^2 = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N (x_i - \\mu)^2\n    \\]\n  - **Why Report Variance?**:\n    - Indicates reliability (low variance = consistent data).\n    - Helps compare distributions (e.g., privacy concerns across demographics).\n\n---\n\n## **Mermaid Knowledge Graphs**\n### **Graph 1: Text Analysis Techniques**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Text Analysis] --> B[Bag of Words]\n    A --> C[TF-IDF]\n    A --> D[LIWC]\n    A --> E[Word Embeddings]\n    E --> F[Static: Word2Vec/GloVe]\n    E --> G[Contextual: BERT]\n    B -->|Pros| H[Simple, Fast]\n    B -->|Cons| I[No Context]\n    C -->|Pros| J[Reduces Noise]\n    C -->|Cons| K[Still Context-Agnostic]\n    G --> L[Performance Saturates Quickly]\n    C --> M[Improves with More Data]\n```\n\n### **Graph 2: Privacy & Security Concepts**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Privacy & Security] --> B[Privacy Laws]\n    A --> C[Data Breaches]\n    A --> D[Anonymization]\n    A --> E[Graph Analytics]\n    B --> F[GDPR]\n    B --> G[GLBA]\n    B --> H[PCI-DSS]\n    C --> I[FTC Guidelines]\n    C --> J[OECD Principles]\n    D --> K[Generalization]\n    D --> L[k-Anonymity]\n    D --> M[Perturbation]\n    E --> N[Betweenness Centrality]\n    N --> O[Node 4 in Graph]\n```\n\n### **Graph 3: Ethical Experiments & Social Phenomena**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Ethics in Experiments] --> B[3R Approach]\n    A --> C[Emotional Contagion]\n    A --> D[OkCupid]\n    B --> E[Replace]\n    B --> F[Reduce]\n    B --> G[Refine]\n    C --> H[Lack of Consent]\n    D --> I[Deceptive Practices]\n    A --> J[Social Media Phenomena]\n    J --> K[Homophily]\n    J --> L[Context Collapse]\n    J --> M[Information Revelation]\n```\n\n### **Graph 4: Technical Challenges**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Cyberbullying Detection] --> B[Contextual Ambiguity]\n    A --> C[Multimodal Data]\n    A --> D[Evolving Language]\n    A --> E[Class Imbalance]\n    A --> F[Cultural Differences]\n    G[Fake News Detection] --> H[Warning Label Drawbacks]\n    H --> I[Backfire Effect]\n    H --> J[Over-censorship]\n    H --> K[Platform Bias]\n```\n\n---\n## **Key Equations (Math Focus)**\n1. **TF-IDF**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{TF-IDF}(t, d) = \\underbrace{\\frac{f_{t,d}}{\\max(f_w,d)}}_{\\text{Term Frequency}} \\times \\underbrace{\\log\\left(\\frac{N}{|\\{d \\in D: t \\in d\\}|}\\right)}_{\\text{Inverse Document Frequency}}\n   \\]\n   - \\(f_{t,d}\\): Frequency of term \\(t\\) in document \\(d\\).\n   - \\(N\\): Total documents.\n   - \\(|\\{d \\in D: t \\in d\\}|\\): Documents containing \\(t\\).\n\n2. **Betweenness Centrality**:\n   \\[\n   C_B(v) = \\sum_{s \\neq v \\neq t} \\frac{\\sigma_{st}(v)}{\\sigma_{st}}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Variance**:\n   \\[\n   \\sigma^2 = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N (x_i - \\mu)^2\n   \\]",
