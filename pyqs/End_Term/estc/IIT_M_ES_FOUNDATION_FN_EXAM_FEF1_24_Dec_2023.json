        "summary": "Here\u2019s a structured **summary of core topics, concepts, principles, and equations** essential for the exam, followed by **Mermaid knowledge graphs** to visualize relationships.\n\n---\n\n## **Core Topics & Concepts**\n### **1. Number Systems & Digital Electronics**\n- **Binary to Decimal Conversion**:\n  - \\( (10101)_2 = 1 \\times 2^4 + 0 \\times 2^3 + 1 \\times 2^2 + 0 \\times 2^1 + 1 \\times 2^0 = 21 \\) (not 22).\n  - **Key Equation**:\n    \\[\n    (b_n b_{n-1} \\dots b_0)_2 = \\sum_{k=0}^n b_k \\times 2^k\n    \\]\n\n- **Flash ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter)**:\n  - Requires \\( 2^N - 1 \\) comparators for \\( N \\)-bit resolution.\n  - **Key Concept**: Parallel conversion using comparators.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Circuit Analysis Fundamentals**\n#### **Power & Energy**\n- **Power Delivered by an Element**:\n  - \\( P = V \\times I \\).\n  - If \\( P \\) is negative, the element **absorbs** power (e.g., battery charging).\n  - **Example**: For \\( V = -5V \\) and \\( I = 3A \\), \\( P = -15W \\) (absorbed).\n\n- **Power Dissipation in Resistors**:\n  - In **series**, total power is the sum of individual powers.\n  - **Example**: Five resistors in series with total power \\( 10W \\). Each resistor dissipates \\( 2W \\) (not 10W).\n\n#### **Resistor Networks**\n- **Series & Parallel Resistors**:\n  - Series: \\( R_{total} = R_1 + R_2 + \\dots + R_n \\).\n  - Parallel: \\( \\frac{1}{R_{total}} = \\frac{1}{R_1} + \\frac{1}{R_2} + \\dots + \\frac{1}{R_n} \\).\n  - **Example**: Two resistors in parallel with \\( R_{total} = 12\\Omega \\). If one breaks, \\( R_{new} = 18\\Omega \\), so the broken resistor was \\( 36\\Omega \\).\n\n- **Equivalent Resistance**:\n  - Use **Y-\u0394 transformations** or **series-parallel reduction**.\n  - **Example**: For a complex network (Q24), simplify step-by-step to find \\( R_{eq} = 54\\Omega \\).\n\n#### **Superposition Principle**\n- **Applicability**:\n  - Valid for **linear circuits** (not for power calculations directly).\n  - **Steps**:\n    1. Turn off all sources except one.\n    2. Calculate the response (voltage/current).\n    3. Repeat for all sources.\n    4. Sum the responses.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Capacitors & Transients**\n#### **Capacitor Basics**\n- **Charge-Voltage Relationship**:\n  \\[\n  Q = C \\times V\n  \\]\n- **Series & Parallel Capacitors**:\n  - Series: \\( \\frac{1}{C_{total}} = \\frac{1}{C_1} + \\frac{1}{C_2} \\).\n  - Parallel: \\( C_{total} = C_1 + C_2 \\).\n\n#### **RC Circuits & Time Constants**\n- **Time Constant (\\( \\tau \\))**:\n  \\[\n  \\tau = R_{eq} \\times C\n  \\]\n  - **Example**: For \\( R_{eq} = 2k\\Omega \\) and \\( C = 0.1\\mu F \\), \\( \\tau = 0.2ms \\).\n\n- **Transient Response**:\n  - Voltage across capacitor: \\( V_C(t) = V_f + (V_i - V_f)e^{-t/\\tau} \\).\n  - **Initial/Final Conditions**:\n    - \\( V_C(0^+) = V_C(0^-) \\) (capacitor voltage cannot change instantaneously).\n    - \\( V_C(\\infty) = \\) steady-state value (e.g., \\( -50V \\) in Q30).\n\n- **Current Through Capacitor**:\n  \\[\n  i_C(t) = C \\frac{dV_C}{dt}\n  \\]\n  - **Slope of Voltage**: \\( \\frac{dV_C}{dt} = \\frac{i_C(t)}{C} \\).\n  - **Example**: At \\( t=5s \\), slope \\( \\approx -0.37V/s \\).\n\n---\n\n### **4. Sampling & Signal Processing**\n#### **Nyquist Sampling Theorem**\n- **Minimum Sampling Rate**:\n  \\[\n  f_s \\geq 2 \\times f_{max}\n  \\]\n  - **Example**: For a \\( 100kHz \\) signal, \\( f_s \\geq 200kHz \\).\n  - **Time Interval**: \\( T_s = \\frac{1}{f_s} \\). For \\( f_s = 8kHz \\), \\( T_s = 125\\mu s \\).\n\n#### **Amplitude Modulation (AM)**\n- **Frequency Components**:\n  - For \\( m(t) = A_m \\sin(2\\pi f_m t) \\) and carrier \\( c(t) = A_c \\sin(2\\pi f_c t) \\), the AM signal has frequencies:\n    \\[\n    f_c - f_m, f_c, f_c + f_m\n    \\]\n  - **Example**: For \\( f_c = 100MHz \\) and \\( f_m = 100kHz, 200kHz \\), the AM signal contains:\n    - Lowest frequency: \\( 100 - 0.2 = 99.8MHz \\).\n    - Highest frequency: \\( 100 + 0.2 = 100.2MHz \\).\n\n---\n\n### **5. AC Circuits & Phase Relationships**\n#### **RC Low-Pass Filter**\n- **Phase Shift**:\n  - Output lags input by \\( 0^\\circ \\) to \\( 90^\\circ \\) (not in phase).\n- **Cutoff Frequency**:\n  \\[\n  f_c = \\frac{1}{2\\pi RC}\n  \\]\n\n#### **Sine Wave Basics**\n- **Period-Time Relationship**:\n  \\[\n  T = \\frac{1}{f}\n  \\]\n  - **Example**: For \\( f = 100kHz \\), \\( T = 10\\mu s \\) (not \\( 5\\mu s \\)).\n\n---\n\n## **Key Equations Summary**\n| **Topic**               | **Equation**                                                                 |\n|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Binary to Decimal       | \\( (b_n \\dots b_0)_2 = \\sum_{k=0}^n b_k \\times 2^k \\)                       |\n| Flash ADC Comparators    | \\( 2^N - 1 \\) comparators for \\( N \\)-bit ADC.                             |\n| Power                   | \\( P = V \\times I \\)                                                        |\n| Series Resistors        | \\( R_{total} = \\sum R_i \\)                                                 |\n| Parallel Resistors      | \\( \\frac{1}{R_{total}} = \\sum \\frac{1}{R_i} \\)                              |\n| Capacitor Charge        | \\( Q = C \\times V \\)                                                        |\n| RC Time Constant        | \\( \\tau = R \\times C \\)                                                    |\n| Capacitor Voltage       | \\( V_C(t) = V_f + (V_i - V_f)e^{-t/\\tau} \\)                                |\n| Capacitor Current       | \\( i_C(t) = C \\frac{dV_C}{dt} \\)                                           |\n| Nyquist Sampling        | \\( f_s \\geq 2 \\times f_{max} \\)                                            |\n| AM Frequency Components | \\( f_c \\pm f_m \\)                                                           |\n\n---\n\n## **Mermaid Knowledge Graphs**\n### **1.
