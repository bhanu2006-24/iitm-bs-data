The Smith family from South-East England were celebrating Christmas at a beach resort in southern Thailand. Tilly Smith was a ten-year-old schoolgirl; her sister was seven years old. Their parents were Penny and Colin Smith.  It was 26 December 2004. Deadly tsunami waves were already on their way. They had been triggered by a massive earthquake off northern Sumatra earlier that morning.  \u201cThe water was swelling and kept coming in,\u201d Penny Smith remembered. \u201cThe beach was getting smaller and smaller. I didn\u2019t know what was happening.  But Tilly Smith sensed that something was wrong. Her mind kept going back to a geography lesson she had taken in England just two weeks before she flew out to Thailand with her family.  Tilly saw the sea slowly rise, and start to foam, bubble and form whirlpools. She remembered that she had seen this in class in a video of a tsunami that had hit the Hawaiian islands in 1946. Her geography teacher had shown her class the video, and told them that tsunamis can be caused by earthquakes, volcanoes and landslides.  Tilly started to scream at her family to get off the beach. \u201cShe talked about an earthquake under the sea. She got more and more hysterical,\u201d said her mother Penny. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what a tsunami was. But seeing my daughter so frightened, I thought something serious must be going on.\u201d  Tilly\u2019s parents took her and her sister away from the beach, to the swimming pool at the hotel. A number of other tourists also left the beach with them. \u201cThen it was as if the entire sea had come out after them. I was screaming, \u2018Run!\u2019\u201d  The family took refuge in the third floor of the hotel. The building withstood the surge of three tsunami waves. If they had stayed on the beach, they would not have been alive.  The Smiths later met other tourists who had lost entire families. Thanks to Tilly and her geography lesson, they had been forewarned. Tilly went back to her school in England and told her classmates her terrifying tale.  The Tsunami - Sonali Deraniyagala",

The Smith family from South-East England were celebrating Christmas at a beach resort in southern Thailand. Tilly Smith was a ten-year-old schoolgirl; her sister was seven years old. Their parents were Penny and Colin Smith.  It was 26 December 2004. Deadly tsunami waves were already on their way. They had been triggered by a massive earthquake off northern Sumatra earlier that morning.  \u201cThe water was swelling and kept coming in,\u201d Penny Smith remembered. \u201cThe beach was getting smaller and smaller. I didn\u2019t know what was happening.  But Tilly Smith sensed that something was wrong. Her mind kept going back to a geography lesson she had taken in England just two weeks before she flew out to Thailand with her family.  Tilly saw the sea slowly rise, and start to foam, bubble and form whirlpools. She remembered that she had seen this in class in a video of a tsunami that had hit the Hawaiian islands in 1946. Her geography teacher had shown her class the video, and told them that tsunamis can be caused by earthquakes, volcanoes and landslides.  Tilly started to scream at her family to get off the beach. \u201cShe talked about an earthquake under the sea. She got more and more hysterical,\u201d said her mother Penny. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what a tsunami was. But seeing my daughter so frightened, I thought something serious must be going on.\u201d  Tilly\u2019s parents took her and her sister away from the beach, to the swimming pool at the hotel. A number of other tourists also left the beach with them. \u201cThen it was as if the entire sea had come out after them. I was screaming, \u2018Run!\u2019\u201d  The family took refuge in the third floor of the hotel. The building withstood the surge of three tsunami waves. If they had stayed on the beach, they would not have been alive.  The Smiths later met other tourists who had lost entire families. Thanks to Tilly and her geography lesson, they had been forewarned. Tilly went back to her school in England and told her classmates her terrifying tale.  The Tsunami - Sonali Deraniyagala",

The Smith family from South-East England were celebrating Christmas at a beach resort in southern Thailand. Tilly Smith was a ten-year-old schoolgirl; her sister was seven years old. Their parents were Penny and Colin Smith.  It was 26 December 2004. Deadly tsunami waves were already on their way. They had been triggered by a massive earthquake off northern Sumatra earlier that morning.  \u201cThe water was swelling and kept coming in,\u201d Penny Smith remembered. \u201cThe beach was getting smaller and smaller. I didn\u2019t know what was happening.  But Tilly Smith sensed that something was wrong. Her mind kept going back to a geography lesson she had taken in England just two weeks before she flew out to Thailand with her family.  Tilly saw the sea slowly rise, and start to foam, bubble and form whirlpools. She remembered that she had seen this in class in a video of a tsunami that had hit the Hawaiian islands in 1946. Her geography teacher had shown her class the video, and told them that tsunamis can be caused by earthquakes, volcanoes and landslides.  Tilly started to scream at her family to get off the beach. \u201cShe talked about an earthquake under the sea. She got more and more hysterical,\u201d said her mother Penny. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what a tsunami was. But seeing my daughter so frightened, I thought something serious must be going on.\u201d  Tilly\u2019s parents took her and her sister away from the beach, to the swimming pool at the hotel. A number of other tourists also left the beach with them. \u201cThen it was as if the entire sea had come out after them. I was screaming, \u2018Run!\u2019\u201d  The family took refuge in the third floor of the hotel. The building withstood the surge of three tsunami waves. If they had stayed on the beach, they would not have been alive.  The Smiths later met other tourists who had lost entire families. Thanks to Tilly and her geography lesson, they had been forewarned. Tilly went back to her school in England and told her classmates her terrifying tale.  The Tsunami - Sonali Deraniyagala",

The Smith family from South-East England were celebrating Christmas at a beach resort in southern Thailand. Tilly Smith was a ten-year-old schoolgirl; her sister was seven years old. Their parents were Penny and Colin Smith.  It was 26 December 2004. Deadly tsunami waves were already on their way. They had been triggered by a massive earthquake off northern Sumatra earlier that morning.  \u201cThe water was swelling and kept coming in,\u201d Penny Smith remembered. \u201cThe beach was getting smaller and smaller. I didn\u2019t know what was happening.  But Tilly Smith sensed that something was wrong. Her mind kept going back to a geography lesson she had taken in England just two weeks before she flew out to Thailand with her family.  Tilly saw the sea slowly rise, and start to foam, bubble and form whirlpools. She remembered that she had seen this in class in a video of a tsunami that had hit the Hawaiian islands in 1946. Her geography teacher had shown her class the video, and told them that tsunamis can be caused by earthquakes, volcanoes and landslides.  Tilly started to scream at her family to get off the beach. \u201cShe talked about an earthquake under the sea. She got more and more hysterical,\u201d said her mother Penny. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what a tsunami was. But seeing my daughter so frightened, I thought something serious must be going on.\u201d  Tilly\u2019s parents took her and her sister away from the beach, to the swimming pool at the hotel. A number of other tourists also left the beach with them. \u201cThen it was as if the entire sea had come out after them. I was screaming, \u2018Run!\u2019\u201d  The family took refuge in the third floor of the hotel. The building withstood the surge of three tsunami waves. If they had stayed on the beach, they would not have been alive.  The Smiths later met other tourists who had lost entire families. Thanks to Tilly and her geography lesson, they had been forewarned. Tilly went back to her school in England and told her classmates her terrifying tale.  The Tsunami - Sonali Deraniyagala",

The Smith family from South-East England were celebrating Christmas at a beach resort in southern Thailand. Tilly Smith was a ten-year-old schoolgirl; her sister was seven years old. Their parents were Penny and Colin Smith.  It was 26 December 2004. Deadly tsunami waves were already on their way. They had been triggered by a massive earthquake off northern Sumatra earlier that morning.  \u201cThe water was swelling and kept coming in,\u201d Penny Smith remembered. \u201cThe beach was getting smaller and smaller. I didn\u2019t know what was happening.  But Tilly Smith sensed that something was wrong. Her mind kept going back to a geography lesson she had taken in England just two weeks before she flew out to Thailand with her family.  Tilly saw the sea slowly rise, and start to foam, bubble and form whirlpools. She remembered that she had seen this in class in a video of a tsunami that had hit the Hawaiian islands in 1946. Her geography teacher had shown her class the video, and told them that tsunamis can be caused by earthquakes, volcanoes and landslides.  Tilly started to scream at her family to get off the beach. \u201cShe talked about an earthquake under the sea. She got more and more hysterical,\u201d said her mother Penny. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what a tsunami was. But seeing my daughter so frightened, I thought something serious must be going on.\u201d  Tilly\u2019s parents took her and her sister away from the beach, to the swimming pool at the hotel. A number of other tourists also left the beach with them. \u201cThen it was as if the entire sea had come out after them. I was screaming, \u2018Run!\u2019\u201d  The family took refuge in the third floor of the hotel. The building withstood the surge of three tsunami waves. If they had stayed on the beach, they would not have been alive.  The Smiths later met other tourists who had lost entire families. Thanks to Tilly and her geography lesson, they had been forewarned. Tilly went back to her school in England and told her classmates her terrifying tale.  The Tsunami - Sonali Deraniyagala",
