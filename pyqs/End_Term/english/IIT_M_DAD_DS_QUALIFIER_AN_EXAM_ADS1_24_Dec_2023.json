The Smith family from South-East England were celebrating Christmas at a beach resort in southern Thailand. Tilly Smith was a ten-year-old schoolgirl; her sister was seven years old. Their parents were Penny and Colin Smith.  It was 26 December 2004. Deadly tsunami waves were already on their way. They had been triggered by a massive earthquake off northern Sumatra earlier that morning.  \u201cThe water was swelling and kept coming in,\u201d Penny Smith remembered. \u201cThe beach was getting smaller and smaller. I didn\u2019t know what was happening.  But Tilly Smith sensed that something was wrong. Her mind kept going back to a geography lesson she had taken in England just two weeks before she flew out to Thailand with her family.  Tilly saw the sea slowly rise, and start to foam, bubble and form whirlpools. She remembered that she had seen this in class in a video of a tsunami that had hit the Hawaiian islands in 1946. Her geography teacher had shown her class the video, and told them that tsunamis can be caused by earthquakes, volcanoes and landslides.  Tilly started to scream at her family to get off the beach. \u201cShe talked about an earthquake under the sea. She got more and more hysterical,\u201d said her mother Penny. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what a tsunami was. But seeing my daughter so frightened, I thought something serious must be going on.\u201d  Tilly\u2019s parents took her and her sister away from the beach, to the swimming pool at the hotel. A number of other tourists also left the beach with them. \u201cThen it was as if the entire sea had come out after them. I was screaming, \u2018Run!\u2019\u201d  The family took refuge in the third floor of the hotel. The building withstood the surge of three tsunami waves. If they had stayed on the beach, they would not have been alive.  The Smiths later met other tourists who had lost entire families. Thanks to Tilly and her geography lesson, they had been forewarned. Tilly went back to her school in England and told her classmates her terrifying tale.  The Tsunami - Sonali Deraniyagala",

The Smith family from South-East England were celebrating Christmas at a beach resort in southern Thailand. Tilly Smith was a ten-year-old schoolgirl; her sister was seven years old. Their parents were Penny and Colin Smith.  It was 26 December 2004. Deadly tsunami waves were already on their way. They had been triggered by a massive earthquake off northern Sumatra earlier that morning.  \u201cThe water was swelling and kept coming in,\u201d Penny Smith remembered. \u201cThe beach was getting smaller and smaller. I didn\u2019t know what was happening.  But Tilly Smith sensed that something was wrong. Her mind kept going back to a geography lesson she had taken in England just two weeks before she flew out to Thailand with her family.  Tilly saw the sea slowly rise, and start to foam, bubble and form whirlpools. She remembered that she had seen this in class in a video of a tsunami that had hit the Hawaiian islands in 1946. Her geography teacher had shown her class the video, and told them that tsunamis can be caused by earthquakes, volcanoes and landslides.  Tilly started to scream at her family to get off the beach. \u201cShe talked about an earthquake under the sea. She got more and more hysterical,\u201d said her mother Penny. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what a tsunami was. But seeing my daughter so frightened, I thought something serious must be going on.\u201d  Tilly\u2019s parents took her and her sister away from the beach, to the swimming pool at the hotel. A number of other tourists also left the beach with them. \u201cThen it was as if the entire sea had come out after them. I was screaming, \u2018Run!\u2019\u201d  The family took refuge in the third floor of the hotel. The building withstood the surge of three tsunami waves. If they had stayed on the beach, they would not have been alive.  The Smiths later met other tourists who had lost entire families. Thanks to Tilly and her geography lesson, they had been forewarned. Tilly went back to her school in England and told her classmates her terrifying tale.  The Tsunami - Sonali Deraniyagala",

The Smith family from South-East England were celebrating Christmas at a beach resort in southern Thailand. Tilly Smith was a ten-year-old schoolgirl; her sister was seven years old. Their parents were Penny and Colin Smith.  It was 26 December 2004. Deadly tsunami waves were already on their way. They had been triggered by a massive earthquake off northern Sumatra earlier that morning.  \u201cThe water was swelling and kept coming in,\u201d Penny Smith remembered. \u201cThe beach was getting smaller and smaller. I didn\u2019t know what was happening.  But Tilly Smith sensed that something was wrong. Her mind kept going back to a geography lesson she had taken in England just two weeks before she flew out to Thailand with her family.  Tilly saw the sea slowly rise, and start to foam, bubble and form whirlpools. She remembered that she had seen this in class in a video of a tsunami that had hit the Hawaiian islands in 1946. Her geography teacher had shown her class the video, and told them that tsunamis can be caused by earthquakes, volcanoes and landslides.  Tilly started to scream at her family to get off the beach. \u201cShe talked about an earthquake under the sea. She got more and more hysterical,\u201d said her mother Penny. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what a tsunami was. But seeing my daughter so frightened, I thought something serious must be going on.\u201d  Tilly\u2019s parents took her and her sister away from the beach, to the swimming pool at the hotel. A number of other tourists also left the beach with them. \u201cThen it was as if the entire sea had come out after them. I was screaming, \u2018Run!\u2019\u201d  The family took refuge in the third floor of the hotel. The building withstood the surge of three tsunami waves. If they had stayed on the beach, they would not have been alive.  The Smiths later met other tourists who had lost entire families. Thanks to Tilly and her geography lesson, they had been forewarned. Tilly went back to her school in England and told her classmates her terrifying tale.  The Tsunami - Sonali Deraniyagala"

The Smith family from South-East England were celebrating Christmas at a beach resort in southern Thailand. Tilly Smith was a ten-year-old schoolgirl; her sister was seven years old. Their parents were Penny and Colin Smith.  It was 26 December 2004. Deadly tsunami waves were already on their way. They had been triggered by a massive earthquake off northern Sumatra earlier that morning.  \u201cThe water was swelling and kept coming in,\u201d Penny Smith remembered. \u201cThe beach was getting smaller and smaller. I didn\u2019t know what was happening.  But Tilly Smith sensed that something was wrong. Her mind kept going back to a geography lesson she had taken in England just two weeks before she flew out to Thailand with her family.  Tilly saw the sea slowly rise, and start to foam, bubble and form whirlpools. She remembered that she had seen this in class in a video of a tsunami that had hit the Hawaiian islands in 1946. Her geography teacher had shown her class the video, and told them that tsunamis can be caused by earthquakes, volcanoes and landslides.  Tilly started to scream at her family to get off the beach. \u201cShe talked about an earthquake under the sea. She got more and more hysterical,\u201d said her mother Penny. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what a tsunami was. But seeing my daughter so frightened, I thought something serious must be going on.\u201d  Tilly\u2019s parents took her and her sister away from the beach, to the swimming pool at the hotel. A number of other tourists also left the beach with them. \u201cThen it was as if the entire sea had come out after them. I was screaming, \u2018Run!\u2019\u201d  The family took refuge in the third floor of the hotel. The building withstood the surge of three tsunami waves. If they had stayed on the beach, they would not have been alive.  The Smiths later met other tourists who had lost entire families. Thanks to Tilly and her geography lesson, they had been forewarned. Tilly went back to her school in England and told her classmates her terrifying tale.  The Tsunami - Sonali Deraniyagala",

        "summary": "### **Exam Summary: Qualifier Level \u2013 English (Computer-Based Exam)**\nThis exam tests **reading comprehension, grammar, vocabulary, sentence structure, and writing skills**. Below is a structured breakdown of the **core topics, concepts, and rules** assessed in the paper.\n\n---\n\n## **1. Reading Comprehension**\n### **Key Skills Tested:**\n- **Understanding context** (e.g., identifying details like locations, events, and causes).\n- **Inferring meaning** (e.g., deducing the meaning of words like \"resort\" or antonyms like \"calm\" for \"hysterical\").\n- **Fact-based recall** (e.g., where Tilly saw the tsunami video, causes of tsunamis).\n\n### **Core Concepts:**\n- **Literal vs. Inferential Questions**:\n  - *Literal*: Directly stated in the text (e.g., \"Where had Tilly seen the sea behaving strangely?\").\n  - *Inferential*: Requires reasoning (e.g., \"Why did Tilly\u2019s family leave the beach?\").\n- **Vocabulary in Context**:\n  - Example: \"resort\" (holiday destination), \"hysterical\" (antonym: \"calm\").\n- **Cause and Effect**:\n  - Tsunami triggered by an earthquake \u2192 Tilly\u2019s warning \u2192 family\u2019s survival.\n\n### **Passage Analysis (Example: Tsunami Story)**\n| **Element**          | **Details**                                                                 |\n|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Characters**        | Tilly Smith (10-year-old), her sister (7), parents (Penny & Colin Smith).  |\n| **Setting**           | Beach resort in southern Thailand (26 Dec 2004).                           |\n| **Key Event**         | Tsunami triggered by an earthquake; Tilly recognizes signs from a school lesson. |\n| **Outcome**           | Family survives by moving to the hotel\u2019s 3rd floor.                        |\n| **Moral/Lesson**      | Importance of education and quick thinking in emergencies.                 |\n\n---\n\n## **2. Grammar**\n### **Key Topics:**\n#### **A. Subject-Verb Agreement**\n- **Rule**: Singular subjects take singular verbs; plural subjects take plural verbs.\n  - Example:\n    - \u2705 *\"His advice **is** valuable.\"* (Correct; \"advice\" is uncountable/singular).\n    - \u274c *\"His advice **are** valuable.\"* (Incorrect).\n\n#### **B. Tenses**\n- **Present Perfect vs. Simple Past**:\n  - *Present Perfect*: Actions continuing to the present or with unspecified time.\n    - Example: *\"I **have not seen** him since last Monday.\"*\n  - *Simple Past*: Completed actions with a specific time.\n    - Example: *\"I **saw** him last Monday.\"*\n\n#### **C. Word Choice (Confusing Verbs)**\n- **Hang vs. Hung**:\n  - *\"He **hung** the pictures.\"* (Correct; \"hanged\" is for executions).\n- **May vs. Might**:\n  - *\"I **might** see you tomorrow.\"* (Less certainty than \"may\").\n\n#### **D. Articles (A/An/The/No Article)**\n- **Rule**: No article for uncountable nouns or general statements.\n  - Example: *\"I can\u2019t live on **\u2205** 600 dollars a month.\"*\n\n#### **E. Phrasal Verbs**\n- **Bring up** (raise children), **give up** (quit), **pick up** (collect), **get off** (exit).\n  - Example: *\"The kids were well **brought up**.\"*\n\n#### **F. Conjunctions**\n- **Until** (time-based), **while** (simultaneous actions), **unless** (condition), **although** (contrast).\n  - Example: *\"We worked **until** night came.\"*\n\n#### **G. Question Tags**\n- **Rule**: Positive statement \u2192 negative tag (and vice versa).\n  - Example: *\"We shall never step foot there again, **shall we**?\"*\n\n#### **H. Parts of Speech**\n- **Adjectives**: Describe nouns (e.g., *\"ripe tomatoes\"* \u2192 \"ripe\" is an adjective).\n- **Nouns/Verbs/Pronouns**: Identify based on function in the sentence.\n\n---\n\n## **3. Vocabulary**\n### **Key Words & Meanings:**\n| **Word**      | **Meaning**                          | **Example in Context**                     |\n|---------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|\n| Resort        | Holiday destination.                 | *\"Beach resort in Thailand.\"*              |\n| Hysterical    | Extremely emotional/uncontrollable. | Antonym: *\"calm.\"*                          |\n| Tsunami       | Giant sea wave (caused by earthquakes/volcanoes/landslides). | *\"Triggered by an earthquake.\"* |\n| Whirlpools    | Swirling water.                      | *\"Sea started to foam and form whirlpools.\"* |\n| Forewarned    | Warned in advance.                   | *\"They had been forewarned.\"*              |\n\n---\n\n## **4.
