        "summary": "Since this is a **\"Qualifier: English\"** exam, the core topics, concepts, and principles are centered around **English language proficiency**, including **grammar, vocabulary, reading comprehension, listening comprehension, punctuation, and writing skills**. Below is a structured summary of the essential areas to study for this exam.\n\n---\n\n## **Core Topics & Concepts Summary**\n\n### **1. Reading Comprehension**\n   - **Key Skills**:\n     - Understanding the **main idea** and **supporting details** in a passage.\n     - Inferring **meaning from context** (e.g., idioms, phrases, implied meanings).\n     - Identifying **tone, mood, and author\u2019s intent**.\n     - Analyzing **cause-and-effect relationships** in a text.\n   - **Example from Questions**:\n     - *\"There is hardly any elbow room\"* \u2192 Means **\"very little space\"** (idiomatic expression).\n     - *\"Cordon off\"* \u2192 Means **\"to restrict access\"** (contextual meaning from the passage on Cyclone Ockhi).\n\n### **2. Vocabulary & Word Meanings**\n   - **Key Concepts**:\n     - **Synonyms & Antonyms** (e.g., \"stranded\" = left alone).\n     - **Word Usage in Context** (e.g., \"predicament\" vs. \"prediction\").\n     - **Commonly Confused Words** (e.g., \"legacy\" = something left behind, not a \"treat\").\n   - **Important Words from Questions**:\n     | Word          | Meaning                                                                 |\n     |---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n     | Stranded      | Left in a difficult situation without help.                            |\n     | Predicament   | A difficult or unpleasant situation.                                   |\n     | Legacy        | Something (property, ideas, reputation) left by a person after death. |\n     | Elbow room    | Space to move freely (idiom).                                           |\n     | Cordon off    | To restrict access to an area.                                         |\n\n### **3. Grammar**\n   - **Key Rules**:\n     - **Subject-Verb Agreement**:\n       - Singular subjects take singular verbs (*\"Nobody **has**\"*).\n       - Plural subjects take plural verbs (*\"They **have**\"*).\n     - **Present Perfect Tense**:\n       - *\"She **has been** working here since 2015.\"* (action started in past, continues now).\n     - **Articles (A/An/The)**:\n       - *\"A\"* before consonant sounds (*\"a new car\"*).\n       - *\"An\"* before vowel sounds (*\"an apple\"*).\n       - *\"The\"* for specific nouns (*\"the beach\"*).\n     - **Countable vs. Uncountable Nouns**:\n       - *\"Information\"* is **uncountable** (\u274c *\"informations\"* \u2192 \u2705 *\"pieces of information\"*).\n     - **Adjective Order**:\n       - **Size \u2192 Shape \u2192 Age \u2192 Color \u2192 Origin \u2192 Material** (*\"huge wooden boxes\"* \u2705 vs. *\"wooden several boxes\"* \u274c).\n     - **Tag Questions**:\n       - *\"India is a large country, **isn\u2019t it**?\"* (positive statement + negative tag).\n\n   - **Common Mistakes to Avoid**:\n     - \u274c *\"She gave me a number of **informations**.\"* (Incorrect: \"information\" is uncountable).\n     - \u2705 *\"She gave me **a lot of information**.\"*\n\n### **4. Punctuation**\n   - **Key Rules**:\n     - **Comma ( , )**: Used before *\"however\"* when it connects two independent clauses.\n       - *\"Today may not be the best day. However**,** there is always a tomorrow.\"*\n     - **Full Stop ( . )**: Ends a complete sentence.\n     - **Colon ( : )**: Introduces a list or explanation.\n     - **Ellipsis ( \u2026 )**: Indicates omission or trailing off.\n\n### **5. Listening Comprehension (Audio-Based Questions)**\n   - **Key Skills**:\n     - Understanding **spoken English** (accents, speed, tone).\n     - **Filling in blanks** based on audio cues.\n     - Identifying **key words** in a sentence (e.g., *\"stranded\"*, *\"legacy\"*).\n   - **Tips**:\n     - Listen for **context clues** (e.g., *\"thousands of miles from home\"* suggests *\"left alone\"*).\n     - Pay attention to **grammar in speech** (e.g., *\"would make many people **despair**\"* \u2192 *\"predicament\"* fits best).\n\n### **6. Writing Skills (Email Drafting)**\n   - **Key Components of a Formal Email**:\n     1. **Subject Line**: Clear and concise (e.g., *\"Acceptance of Graduate School Offer\"*).\n     2. **Salutation**: *\"Dear [Admissions Committee/Professor\u2019s Name],\"*\n     3. **Body**:\n        - **Opening**: Express gratitude (*\"Thank you for the offer...\"*).\n        - **Acceptance**: Clearly state acceptance (*\"I am pleased to accept...\"*).\n        - **Academic Plan**: Briefly mention goals (*\"I plan to focus on [topic] under [professor\u2019s name]...\"*).\n     4. **Closing**: *\"Sincerely, [Your Name]\"*\n   - **Example Structure (200 words)**:\n     ```\n     Subject: Acceptance of Graduate School Offer \u2013 [Your Name]\n\n     Dear [Admissions Committee],\n\n     I hope this email finds you well.
