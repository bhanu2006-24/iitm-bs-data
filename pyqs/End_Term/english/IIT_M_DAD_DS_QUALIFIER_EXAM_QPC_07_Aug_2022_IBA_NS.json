        "summary": "### **Exam Summary: Qualifier - English**\nThis exam tests **English language proficiency**, focusing on:\n1. **Reading Comprehension** (Passage-based questions)\n2. **Vocabulary** (Meaning of words in context)\n3. **Grammar** (Sentence structure, tenses, articles, subject-verb agreement, punctuation)\n4. **Writing Skills** (Drafting a formal email)\n\n---\n\n## **Core Topics & Concepts**\n\n### **1. Reading Comprehension**\n- **Key Skills:**\n  - Understanding **contextual meaning** of phrases/sentences.\n  - Inferring **implicit information** (e.g., impact of Cyclone Ockhi on the beach).\n  - Identifying **literal vs. figurative language** (e.g., \"elbow room\" = lack of space).\n- **Example Questions:**\n  - *\"What does \u2018hardly any elbow room\u2019 mean?\"* \u2192 **Lack of space (Option A).**\n  - *\"What does \u2018cordon off\u2019 imply in the passage?\"* \u2192 **Restricting access to damaged areas (Option C).**\n\n---\n\n### **2. Vocabulary**\n- **Key Words Tested:**\n  | Word          | Meaning in Context                                                                 | Correct Option |\n  |---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|\n  | **Stranded**  | Left alone in a difficult situation (e.g., far from home).                         | A              |\n  | **Predicament** | A difficult or unpleasant situation.                                               | B              |\n  | **Legacy**    | Something (values/property) left behind after death.                               | A              |\n\n- **Strategy:**\n  - Use **context clues** (surrounding sentences) to deduce meanings.\n  - Eliminate **incorrect options** (e.g., \"predatory\" is unrelated to \"predicament\").\n\n---\n\n### **3. Grammar**\n#### **A. Subject-Verb Agreement**\n- **Rules:**\n  - Singular subjects take **singular verbs** (e.g., \"Nobody **has**\").\n  - Plural subjects take **plural verbs** (e.g., \"They **have**\").\n- **Examples:**\n  - *\"Nobody **has** an exclusive right.\"* (Correct: **A**)\n  - *\"She **has been** working here since 2015.\"* (Correct: **A**)\n\n#### **B. Articles (A/An/The)**\n- **Rules:**\n  - **\"A\"** before consonant sounds (e.g., \"a new car\").\n  - **\"An\"** before vowel sounds (e.g., \"an apple\").\n  - **\"The\"** for specific nouns (e.g., \"the Eiffel Tower\").\n- **Example:**\n  - *\"Siva bought **a** new car.\"* (Correct: **A**)\n\n#### **C. Tenses**\n- **Present Perfect Continuous:**\n  - Structure: **Has/Have + been + verb(-ing)**.\n  - Use: Actions **started in the past and continue** (e.g., \"She **has been** working since 2015\").\n- **Past Participles (Irregular Verbs):**\n  - **Begin \u2192 Began \u2192 Begun** (Correct: **D**).\n\n#### **D. Punctuation**\n- **Comma (,):**\n  - Used to **separate clauses** in compound sentences.\n  - Example: *\"However**,** there is always a tomorrow.\"* (Correct: **C**)\n\n#### **E. Question Tags**\n- **Rule:**\n  - Positive statement \u2192 **Negative tag** (e.g., \"India is large, **isn\u2019t it**?\").\n  - Negative statement \u2192 **Positive tag** (e.g., \"You aren\u2019t coming, **are you**?\").\n- **Example:**\n  - *\"India is a large country, **isn\u2019t it**?\"* (Correct: **B**)\n\n#### **F. Adjective Order**\n- **Rule:** **Opinion \u2192 Size \u2192 Shape \u2192 Age \u2192 Color \u2192 Origin \u2192 Material \u2192 Purpose**.\n- **Example:**\n  - *\"Huge wooden boxes\"* (Correct: **A**)\n  - \u274c *\"Several wooden huge boxes\"* (Incorrect order).\n\n#### **G. Uncountable Nouns**\n- **Rule:** Some nouns are **always singular** (e.g., \"information,\" \"news,\" \"furniture\").\n- **Example:**\n  - \u274c *\"A number of **informations**.\"* (Incorrect)\n  - \u2705 *\"A number of **pieces of information**.\"* (Correct)\n\n---\n\n### **4. Writing Skills (Formal Email)**\n- **Structure of an Acceptance Email:**\n  1. **Subject Line:** Clear and concise (e.g., \"Acceptance of Graduate School Offer\").\n  2. **Salutation:** Formal (e.g., \"Dear Admissions Committee,\").\n  3. **Body:**\n     - **Gratitude** (Thank them for the offer).\n     - **Acceptance** (Clearly state you accept).\n     - **Academic Plan** (Briefly mention goals/research interests).\n  4. **Closing:** Polite (e.g., \"Sincerely, [Your Name]\").\n\n- **Example Outline:**\n  > *\"I am writing to formally accept the offer to join [Program Name] at [University]. I am excited to contribute to [specific research area] under [Professor\u2019s Name]. My academic plan includes [brief goal].\"*\n\n---\n\n## **Knowledge Graph (Mermaid Syntax)**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    %% Reading Comprehension\n    A[Reading Comprehension] --> A1[Contextual Meaning]\n    A --> A2[Inference]\n    A --> A3[Literal vs. Figurative]\n\n    %% Vocabulary\n    B[Vocabulary] --> B1[Word Meanings in Context]\n    B --> B2[Synonyms/Antonyms]\n    B --> B3[Eliminating Incorrect Options]\n\n    %% Grammar\n    C[Grammar] --> C1[Subject-Verb Agreement]\n    C --> C2[Articles: A/An/The]\n    C --> C3[Tenses: Present Perfect, Past Participles]\n    C --> C4[Punctuation: Commas, Question Tags]\n    C --> C5[Adjective Order]\n    C --> C6[Uncountable Nouns]\n\n    %% Writing\n    D[Writing Skills] --> D1[Formal Email Structure]\n    D --> D2[Acceptance Letter Components]\n    D --> D3[Academic Plan]\n\n    %% Connections\n    A --> C\n    B --> A\n    C --> D\n```\n\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n    %% Grammar Subtopics\n    Grammar[Grammar] --> SV[Subject-Verb\\nAgreement]\n    Grammar --> Art[Articles]\n    Grammar --> Ten[Tenses]\n    Grammar --> Punc[Punctuation]\n    Grammar --> Adj[Adjective Order]\n    Grammar --> Noun[Uncountable Nouns]\n\n    %% Vocabulary Subtopics\n    Vocab[Vocabulary] --> Mean[Meaning in Context]\n    Vocab --> Syn[Synonyms]\n    Vocab --> Elim[Elimination Strategy]\n\n    %% Reading Comprehension Subtopics\n    Read[Reading\\nComprehension] --> Inf[Inference]\n    Read --> Lit[Literal Meaning]\n    Read --> Fig[Figurative Language]\n```\n\n---\n### **Key Equations/Rules (Grammar)**\n| **Topic**               | **Rule/Equation**                                                                 | **Example**                          |\n|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| **Subject-Verb Agreement** | Singular subject + **s/es** (3rd person)                                          | \"She **has** a book.\"                |\n| **Present Perfect**     | **Has/Have + past participle**                                                    | \"She **has worked** here.\"          |\n| **Past Participle**     | Irregular verbs: **Begin \u2192 Began \u2192 Begun**                                        | \"She **has begun** her work.\"        |\n| **Articles**            | **A** (consonant sound), **An** (vowel sound), **The** (specific)                  | \"A car,\" \"An apple,\" \"The sky\"       |\n| **Question Tags**       | Positive statement + **negative tag** (auxiliary + pronoun)                     | \"You are coming, **aren\u2019t you**?\"   |\n| **Adjective Order**     | **Opinion \u2192 Size \u2192 Age \u2192 Shape \u2192 Color \u2192 Origin \u2192 Material \u2192 Purpose**             | \"Beautiful **large old** round table\"|\n\n---\n### **Exam Tips**\n1. **Reading Comprehension:**\n   - Read the **entire passage** before answering.\n   - Look for **context clues** around the target phrase.\n2. **Vocabulary:**\n   - If unsure, **eliminate wrong options** first.\n3. **Grammar:**\n   - **Subject-verb agreement:** Check if the subject is singular/plural.\n   - **Tenses:** Identify time clues (e.g., \"since 2015\" \u2192 Present Perfect).\n   - **Punctuation:** Commas separate **independent clauses** joined by conjunctions.\n4. **Writing:**\n   - Keep the email **concise, formal, and structured**.\n   - Proofread for **grammar/spelling errors**.",
