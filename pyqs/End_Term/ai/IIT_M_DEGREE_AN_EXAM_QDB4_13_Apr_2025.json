The labels A1, A2, ..., A10, A11, ..., B1, ..., B5 uniquely identify the nodes in the network. When required, use the above label ordering to <b>break ties</b> and to select the correct answers. \n  Run the Rete algorithm for the Working Memory shown below, the WMEs are in timestamp order. Assume that WMEs reside at appropriate Alpha nodes, and the Beta nodes point to WMEs residing in Alpha nodes. \n  For each WME identify its location (node label) in the Rete Net, and prepare the conflict set for the first cycle, then answer the subquestions."
