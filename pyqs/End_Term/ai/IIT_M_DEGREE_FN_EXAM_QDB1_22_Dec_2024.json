Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) with Branch-and-Bound**\n### **Core Concepts**\n- **Branch-and-Bound for TSP**:\n  - **Lower Bounds**: Estimate minimal tour cost.\n  - **Pruning**: Discard branches where `lower bound > current best`.\n  - **Optimal Tour** (Q9): Node `d1` with cost `230`.\n  - **Number of Cities** (Q10): `5` (inferred from edges).\n  - **Optimal Path** (Q11): `A,C,E,B,D`.\n\n---\n\n### **Key Equations**\n1. **TSP Lower Bound** (using Minimum Spanning Tree):\n   \\[\n   \\text{LB} = \\text{MST Cost} + \\text{Min Outgoing Edge per Node}\n   \\]\n\n---\n\n### **Mermaid Knowledge Graph: TSP Branch-and-Bound**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[TSP Branch-and-Bound] --> B[Lower Bounds]\n    A --> C[Pruning]\n    A --> D[Optimal Tour]\n    B --> E[MST-Based]\n    C --> F[Discard Suboptimal Branches]\n```\n\n---\n\n## **Summary of Key Answers**\n| **Question** | **Topic**               | **Key Answer**                     |\n|--------------|-------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| Q3           | Best-First Search       | Path: `S,F,H,G`                    |\n| Q4           | A* Search               | Path: `S,F,I,G`                    |\n| Q5           | Branch-and-Bound        | Path: `S,A,B,D,G`                  |\n| Q7           | Heuristic Admissibility | **Inadmissible**                   |\n| Q9           | TSP Optimal Tour        | Node: `d1`, Cost: `230`           |\n| Q11          | TSP Optimal Path        | `A,C,E,B,D`                        |\n| Q14          | Game Tree Irrelevant    | Nodes: `D,E,G,H`                   |\n| Q15          | SSS* Solved Nodes       | `A,B,C,F`                          |\n| Q16          | Applicable Actions      | `Pickup(E), Unstack(A,B), Unstack(D,C)` |\n| Q17          | Relevant Actions        | `Stack(A,B), Stack(B,C)`           |\n| Q20          | AO* Node Expansion      | `S,C,B`                            |\n| Q22          | AO* Final Value         | `30`                              |\n| Q23          | Rete Conflict Set       | `R1, 103, 105, 106`               |\n| Q26          | CSP Junction Labels     | `NIL`                             |\n| Q27          | CSP Junction Labels     | `L3,W3,L5,L6`                     |\n\n---\n\n## **Final Mermaid Graph: Overall Relationships**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[AI Search Methods] --> B[Pathfinding]\n    A --> C[Game Trees]\n    A --> D[Automated Planning]\n    A --> E[Problem Decomposition]\n    A --> F[Expert Systems]\n    A --> G[Constraint Satisfaction]\n    A --> H[TSP]\n    B --> I[Best-First, A*, Branch-and-Bound]\n    C --> J[Minimax, SSS*]\n    D --> K[Predicates, Operators, Mutex]\n    E --> L[AND-OR Graphs, AO*]\n    F --> M[Rete Algorithm, Conflict Resolution]\n    G --> N[Junction Labeling]\n    H --> O[Branch-and-Bound for TSP]\n```",
