        "summary": "Here\u2019s a structured **summary of core topics, concepts, principles, and equations** for the exam on **\"AI: Search Methods for Problem Solving\"**, along with **Mermaid knowledge graphs** to visualize relationships.\n\n---\n\n## **1. Search Algorithms**\n### **Core Concepts**\n- **Best-First Search (BFS)**:\n  - Uses a priority queue (e.g., min-heap) ordered by a heuristic function (e.g., Manhattan Distance).\n  - Expands the node with the lowest heuristic cost first.\n  - **Not guaranteed to find the shortest path** (unlike Dijkstra\u2019s or A*).\n  - **Tie-breaker**: Alphabetical order of node labels.\n\n- **A* Search**:\n  - Combines **cost-so-far (g(n))** and **heuristic (h(n))** to compute **f(n) = g(n) + h(n)**.\n  - **Optimal** if the heuristic is **admissible** (never overestimates the true cost).\n  - **Manhattan Distance** is a common admissible heuristic for grid-based problems.\n  - **Tie-breaker**: Alphabetical order.\n\n- **Branch-and-Bound (BnB)**:\n  - **Systematic enumeration** of candidate solutions, pruning branches that cannot yield a better solution than the current best.\n  - Used in **TSP (Traveling Salesman Problem)** to find the optimal tour.\n  - **Pruning**: Eliminates suboptimal paths early.\n  - **Tie-breaker**: Reference numbers (e.g., `a1`, `b1`) or alphabetical order.\n\n- **Game Trees (Minimax, Alpha-Beta Pruning, SSS*)**:\n  - **Minimax**: Alternates between MAX (maximizing player) and MIN (minimizing player) levels.\n  - **Alpha-Beta Pruning**: Reduces the search space by eliminating branches that cannot influence the final decision.\n  - **SSS* (Simplified Memory-Bounded A*)**: A memory-efficient variant of A* for game trees.\n  - **Tie-breaker**: Deepest node first, then leftmost.\n\n- **AO* (And-Or Graph Search)**:\n  - Used for **problem decomposition** in AND-OR graphs.\n  - **Heuristic estimates** guide the search.\n  - **Primitive nodes** (solved subproblems) are not expanded further.\n  - **Edge cost**: Typically uniform (e.g., 2 units per edge).\n  - **Tie-breaker 1**: Node labels (alphabetical).\n  - **Tie-breaker 2**: For AND nodes, select the unsolved branch with the **highest cost**.\n\n---\n\n### **Key Equations**\n#### **Heuristic Functions**\n1. **Manhattan Distance** (for grid-based problems):\n   \\[\n   h(n) = |x_n - x_{\\text{goal}}| + |y_n - y_{\\text{goal}}|\n   \\]\n   - **Admissible** if movement is restricted to 4 directions (no diagonals).\n\n2. **A* Cost Function**:\n   \\[\n   f(n) = g(n) + h(n)\n   \\]\n   - \\( g(n) \\): Cost from start to node \\( n \\).\n   - \\( h(n) \\): Heuristic estimate from \\( n \\) to goal.\n\n3. **Branch-and-Bound Pruning**:\n   - Prune a branch if its **lower bound > current best solution**.\n\n#### **Game Tree Evaluations**\n4. **Minimax Value**:\n   - For **MAX nodes**: \\( \\text{value} = \\max(\\text{child values}) \\).\n   - For **MIN nodes**: \\( \\text{value} = \\min(\\text{child values}) \\).\n\n5. **Alpha-Beta Pruning**:\n   - Prune if:\n     - \\( \\text{value} \\leq \\alpha \\) (for MAX nodes).\n     - \\( \\text{value} \\geq \\beta \\) (for MIN nodes).\n\n#### **AO* Algorithm**\n6. **Node Cost Update**:\n   - For **OR nodes**: \\( h(n) = \\min(h(\\text{children}) + \\text{edge cost}) \\).\n   - For **AND nodes**: \\( h(n) = \\max(h(\\text{children}) + \\text{edge cost}) \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Problem-Specific Notes**\n#### **TSP (Traveling Salesman Problem)**\n- **Branch-and-Bound**:\n  - **Optimal tour**: Found at the leaf node with the **minimum cost**.\n  - **Number of cities**: Determined by the depth of the search tree (e.g., 6 cities if the tree has 6 levels).\n  - **Path reconstruction**: Backtrack from the optimal leaf to the root.\n\n#### **Blocks World Planning**\n- **Predicates**:\n  - `armEmpty`, `holding(X)`, `onTable(X)`, `clear(X)`, `on(X, Y)`.\n- **Operators**:\n  - `Pickup(X)`, `Putdown(X)`, `Unstack(X, Y)`, `Stack(X, Y)`.\n- **Applicable Actions**: Must satisfy **preconditions** in the current state.\n- **Relevant Actions**: Actions whose **effects** match the goal state.\n- **Mutex (Mutual Exclusion)**:\n  - **Actions**: Two actions are mutex if they **delete each other\u2019s preconditions**.\n  - **Propositions**: Two propositions are mutex if no action can achieve both.\n\n#### **Rete Algorithm (Rule-Based Systems)**\n- **Conflict Set**: Rules whose **conditions match** the working memory.\n- **Conflict Resolution Strategies**:\n  - **Recency**: Prioritize newer rules/data.\n  - **Specificity**: Prioritize more specific rules.\n- **Beta Nodes**: Perform joins between working memory elements (WMEs).\n\n#### **And-Or Graphs**\n- **Primitive Nodes**: Solved subproblems (actual costs).\n- **Non-Primitive Nodes**: Heuristic estimates.\n- **AO* Expansion**: Updates node costs until the start node is solved.\n\n---\n\n## **2.

Exam-Specific Tips**\n1. **Best-First Search vs. A***:\n   - Best-First uses **only the heuristic** (no path cost).\n   - A* uses **f(n) = g(n) + h(n)**.\n\n2. **Admissibility of Heuristics**:\n   - **Manhattan Distance** is admissible for grid paths without diagonals.\n   - If the heuristic **overestimates**, A* is **not optimal**.\n\n3. **Branch-and-Bound**:\n   - The **optimal tour** is at the leaf with the **lowest cost**.\n   - The **number of cities** equals the **depth of the tree + 1**.\n\n4. **Game Trees**:\n   - **Alpha-Beta prunes** nodes where \\( \\alpha \\geq \\beta \\).\n   - **SSS*** solves nodes in **best-first order** with memory limits.\n\n5. **AO***:\n   - **OR nodes**: Take the **minimum** child cost.\n   - **AND nodes**: Take the **maximum** child cost.\n\n6. **Blocks World**:\n   - **Applicable actions** must satisfy **preconditions** in the current state.\n   - **Relevant actions** achieve **goal predicates**.\n\n7. **Rete Algorithm**:\n   - **Conflict set** = rules whose conditions match WMEs.\n   - **Recency** prioritizes newer rules; **specificity** prioritizes more constrained rules.",
