Search Algorithms**\n### **Core Concepts**\n- **Best-First Search (BFS)**:\n  - Uses a priority queue (e.g., min-heap) ordered by heuristic cost (`f(n) = h(n)`).\n  - **Heuristic**: Manhattan Distance (for grid-based problems).\n  - **Tie-breaker**: Alphabetical order of node labels.\n  - **Example Path (Q3)**: `S,D,G` (prioritizes nodes with lowest `h(n)`).\n\n- **A* Search**:\n  - Combines cost-so-far (`g(n)`) and heuristic (`h(n)`): `f(n) = g(n) + h(n)`.\n  - **Optimality**: Guaranteed if heuristic is **admissible** (never overestimates true cost).\n  - **Example Path (Q4)**: `S,B,E,G`.\n\n- **Branch-and-Bound (BnB)**:\n  - Explores branches systematically, pruning suboptimal paths.\n  - **Variation**: Avoids cycles (e.g., `S,A,S,A,...`).\n  - **Example Path (Q5)**: `S,A,C,F,G` (shortest path in the given graph).\n  - **Shortest Path Guarantee**: Yes (Q6: BnB finds the shortest path).\n\n- **Heuristic Admissibility (Q7)**:\n  - **Admissible**: `h(n) \u2264 true cost` (e.g., Manhattan Distance in unweighted grids).\n  - **Non-admissible**: If overestimates (e.g., Euclidean Distance in weighted grids).\n  - **Answer**: Heuristic in Q7 is **not admissible** (due to weighted edges).\n\n---\n\n### **Key Equations**\n| Algorithm       | Cost Function               | Notes                                  |\n|-----------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Best-First      | `f(n) = h(n)`               | `h(n)` = Manhattan Distance.           |\n| A*              | `f(n) = g(n) + h(n)`        | `g(n)` = path cost from start.         |\n| Branch-and-Bound| `f(n) = g(n)`               | Prunes paths with `g(n) > current best`.|\n\n---\n\n## **2. Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) with Branch-and-Bound**\n### **Core Concepts**\n- **Branch-and-Bound for TSP**:\n  - **Search Tree**: Nodes represent partial tours (include/exclude edges).\n  - **Cost Calculation**: Lower bounds (e.g., minimum edge weights) to prune branches.\n  - **Optimal Tour (Q8, Q9)**:\n    - **Nodes Refined**: 7 or 8 (depends on tree structure).\n    - **Optimal Node**: `e3` (cost = 390).\n    - **Path**: `A,D,C,B,E` (Q11).\n  - **Number of Cities (Q10)**: 5 (inferred from edge labels like `AD`, `BC`, etc.).\n\n- **Pruning in Alpha-Beta (Q14)**:\n  - Prunes nodes where `\u03b1 \u2265 \u03b2` (e.g., nodes `D,E` in the given tree).\n\n- **SSS* Algorithm (Q15)**:\n  - Solves nodes in order of increasing `f(n)`.\n  - **Solved Nodes**: `A,F,G` (lowest costs first).\n\n---\n\n### **Key Equations**\n| Concept               | Equation/Rule                          |\n|-----------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| TSP Lower Bound       | `LB = sum of min outgoing edges`       |\n| Alpha-Beta Pruning    | Prune if `\u03b1 (max) \u2265 \u03b2 (min)`            |\n| SSS* Node Selection   | Expand node with min `f(n) = g(n) + h(n)`|\n\n---\n\n## **3. Game Trees (Minimax, Alpha-Beta, SSS*)**\n### **Core Concepts**\n- **Max/Min Players**:\n  - **Max** chooses highest value; **Min** chooses lowest.\n- **Evaluation Function**: Values at horizon nodes (e.g., `A=12`, `B=94`).\n- **Optimal Strategy (Q12, Q13)**:\n  - **Max\u2019s Best Moves**: `A,D,E` (highest min values).\n  - **Horizon Nodes**: `F,G` (pruned by Alpha-Beta).\n- **Alpha-Beta Pruning (Q14)**:\n  - Prunes `D,E` (since `E=84` > `F=50`).\n- **SSS* (Q15)**:\n  - Solves `A,F,G` (lowest `f(n)` first).\n\n---\n\n### **Key Equations**\n| Concept               | Equation                              |\n|-----------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Minimax               | `v = max(min(...))` for Max\u2019s turn.    |\n| Alpha-Beta            | `\u03b1 = max(\u03b1, v)`; `\u03b2 = min(\u03b2, v)`.     |\n| SSS* Node Selection   | `f(n) = g(n) + h(n)` (like A*).        |\n\n---\n\n## **4.
