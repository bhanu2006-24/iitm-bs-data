        "summary": "Here\u2019s a structured **summary of core topics, concepts, principles, and equations** for the exam **\"AI: Search Methods for Problem Solving\"**, along with **Mermaid knowledge graphs** to visualize relationships.\n\n---\n\n## **1. Search Algorithms**\n### **Core Concepts**\n- **Uninformed Search** (Blind Search):\n  - **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Explores all nodes at the present depth before moving deeper.\n  - **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: Explores as far as possible along a branch before backtracking.\n  - **Uniform Cost Search (UCS)**: Expands the least-cost node first (uses a priority queue).\n  - **Branch-and-Bound (BnB)**: Prunes branches that cannot yield a better solution than the current best.\n    - **Key Idea**: Uses bounds (lower/upper) to eliminate suboptimal paths.\n    - **Variation**: Avoids cyclic expansions (e.g., `S,A,S,A,...`).\n\n- **Informed Search** (Heuristic Search):\n  - **Best-First Search (BFS)**: Expands the most promising node first (uses heuristic `h(n)`).\n    - **Heuristic**: Manhattan Distance (for grid-based problems).\n    - **Tie-Breaker**: Alphabetical order or node labels.\n  - **A* Search**: Combines `g(n)` (cost from start) and `h(n)` (heuristic to goal).\n    - **Cost Function**: `f(n) = g(n) + h(n)`.\n    - **Optimality**: Guaranteed if `h(n)` is **admissible** (never overestimates true cost).\n    - **Admissibility Check**: If `h(n) \u2264 true cost`, it\u2019s admissible.\n  - **AO* Algorithm** (And-Or Graphs):\n    - Solves **AND-OR graphs** (decomposes problems into subproblems).\n    - **Cost Propagation**: Updates node costs based on child solutions.\n    - **Tie-Breakers**:\n      1. Alphabetical order.\n      2. Highest-cost unsolved branch for AND nodes.\n\n- **Game Trees**:\n  - **Minimax Algorithm**: Alternates between MAX (maximizing player) and MIN (minimizing player).\n  - **Alpha-Beta Pruning**: Reduces search space by eliminating suboptimal branches.\n  - **SSS* Algorithm**: Combines A* and game-tree search for optimal paths.\n  - **Conflict Resolution in Games**:\n    - **Specificity**: Prefer more specific rules.\n    - **Recency**: Prefer newer rules/data.\n\n---\n\n### **Key Equations**\n1. **A* Cost Function**:\n   \\[\n   f(n) = g(n) + h(n)\n   \\]\n   - `g(n)`: Cost from start to node `n`.\n   - `h(n)`: Heuristic estimate from `n` to goal.\n\n2. **Manhattan Distance** (for grids):\n   \\[\n   h(n) = |x_n - x_g| + |y_n - y_g|\n   \\]\n   - `(x_n, y_n)`: Coordinates of node `n`.\n   - `(x_g, y_g)`: Coordinates of goal `G`.\n\n3. **Branch-and-Bound Pruning**:\n   - If `cost(current_node) + lower_bound \u2265 best_solution`, prune the branch.\n\n4. **AO* Node Cost Update**:\n   - For **OR nodes**: `cost = min(child_costs) + edge_cost`.\n   - For **AND nodes**: `cost = sum(child_costs) + edge_cost`.\n\n5. **Minimax Value Propagation**:\n   - **MAX Node**: `value = max(child_values)`.\n   - **MIN Node**: `value = min(child_values)`.\n\n---\n\n## **2. Heuristics & Admissibility**\n### **Core Concepts**\n- **Admissible Heuristic**: Never overestimates the true cost (`h(n) \u2264 h*(n)`).\n  - Example: Manhattan Distance for grid paths.\n- **Inadmissible Heuristic**: May overestimate (e.g., Euclidean Distance if obstacles exist).\n- **Consistent Heuristic**: Satisfies `h(n) \u2264 c(n, a, n') + h(n')` for all successors `n'`.\n  - A* with a consistent heuristic is **optimally efficient**.\n\n### **Key Observations**\n- If `h(n)` is **inadmissible**, A* may not find the shortest path (but still finds *a* path).\n- **Tie-Breakers**: Alphabetical order or node labels (e.g., `S,F,H,G` vs. `S,F,I,G`).\n\n---\n\n## **3. Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP)**\n### **Core Concepts**\n- **Variables**: Edges/junctions in line-labeling problems.\n- **Domains**: Possible labels (e.g., convex, concave, arrow for edges).\n- **Constraints**: Junction types (L, T, Y, W) impose label restrictions.\n- **Consistency**: A labeling is consistent if all constraints are satisfied.\n  - **Arc Consistency**: For every variable, all values in its domain satisfy binary constraints.\n- **Backtracking Search**: Assigns values and backtracks on conflicts.\n- ** Waltz Algorithm**: Propagates constraints in line-labeling problems.\n\n### **Key Steps**\n1. **Choose a variable** (e.g., edge or junction).\n2. **Assign a label** from its domain.\n3. **Check consistency** with neighboring constraints.\n4. **Backtrack** if a conflict arises.\n\n---\n\n## **4. Automated Planning (Blocks World)**\n### **Core Concepts**\n- **States**: Defined by predicates (e.g., `armEmpty`, `on(A, B)`).\n- **Operators (Actions)**:\n  - `Pickup(X)`, `Putdown(X)`, `Stack(X, Y)`, `Unstack(X, Y)`.\n- **Preconditions**: Must be true to apply an action.\n- **Effects**: Changes to the state (add/delete predicates).\n- **Applicable Actions**: Actions whose preconditions are satisfied in the current state.\n- **Relevant Actions**: Actions that contribute to achieving the goal.\n\n### **Key Predicates**\n| Predicate       | Meaning                          |\n|-----------------|----------------------------------|\n| `armEmpty`      | Robot arm is empty.              |\n| `holding(X)`    | Arm is holding block `X`.        |\n| `onTable(X)`    | Block `X` is on the table.       |\n| `clear(X)`      | Nothing is on top of `X`.        |\n| `on(X, Y)`      | `X` is directly on `Y`.          |\n\n### **Planning Graph**\n- **Layers**:\n  - **Layer 0**: Initial state.\n  - **Layer 1**: Actions applicable in Layer 0.\n  - **Layer 2**: State after applying Layer 1 actions.\n- **Mutex (Mutual Exclusion)**:\n  - Two actions are mutex if they cannot both be in a valid plan.\n  - Example: `Pickup(E)` and `Unstack(A, B)` cannot both occur in Layer 1 if they interfere.\n\n---\n\n## **5. Rule-Based Expert Systems (Rete Algorithm)**\n### **Core Concepts**\n- **Working Memory (WM)**: Facts/data (e.g., `(Amenity ^pno 2E ^parking YES)`).\n- **Production Rules**: \"IF condition THEN action\" (e.g., `R1`, `R2`).\n- **Rete Network**:\n  - **Alpha Nodes**: Filter WM elements by conditions.\n  - **Beta Nodes**: Join partial matches.\n- **Conflict Resolution Strategies**:\n  - **Specificity**: Prefer rules with more conditions.\n  - **Recency**: Prefer newer WM elements.\n- **Conflict Set**: Rules whose conditions are satisfied by WM.\n\n### **Key Steps**\n1. **Match WM elements** to alpha nodes.\n2. **Propagate tokens** through beta nodes.\n3. **Resolve conflicts** (e.g., specificity, recency).\n4. **Fire the selected rule**.\n\n---\n\n## **6. Problem Decomposition (AND-OR Graphs)**\n### **Core Concepts**\n- **AND Nodes**: All children must be solved (e.g., `S \u2192 A \u2227 B`).\n- **OR Nodes**: Any child can be solved (e.g., `A \u2192 D \u2228 E`).\n- **Primitive Nodes**: Terminal nodes with actual costs (not expanded).\n- **AO* Algorithm**:\n  - Expands nodes based on **cost estimates**.\n  - Updates costs using **backpropagation**.\n  - **Tie-Breakers**:\n    1. Alphabetical order.\n    2. Highest-cost unsolved child for AND nodes.\n\n### **Cost Propagation**\n- **OR Node Cost**: `min(child_costs) + edge_cost`.\n- **AND Node Cost**: `sum(child_costs) + edge_cost`.\n\n---\n\n## **7. Game Trees & Adversarial Search**\n### **Core Concepts**\n- **MAX Player**: Aims to maximize score.\n- **MIN Player**: Aims to minimize score.\n- **Leaf Nodes**: Contain evaluation values (e.g., `A=56`, `B=49`).\n- **Minimax**: Recursively evaluates nodes assuming optimal play.\n- **Alpha-Beta Pruning**: Skips branches that cannot influence the final decision.\n- **SSS***:\n  - Combines A* and game-tree search.\n  - Uses **SOLVED/unsolved** status for nodes.\n\n### **Key Observations**\n- **Optimal Strategy**: MAX player chooses the path with the highest minimax value.\n- **Irrelevant Nodes**: Leaves that don\u2019t affect the final value (pruned).\n\n---\n\n## **8. Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) with Branch-and-Bound**\n### **Core Concepts**\n- **Goal**: Find the shortest tour visiting all cities once.\n- **Branch-and-Bound**:\n  - **Branching**: Splits the problem (e.g., include/exclude edge `XY`).\n  - **Bounding**: Uses lower bounds to prune suboptimal branches.\n- **Search Tree**:\n  - Nodes represent partial tours.\n  - **Cost**: Sum of edge weights in the partial tour.\n- **Optimal Tour**: The complete tour with the **minimum cost**.\n\n### **Key Steps**\n1. Start with all cities unvisited.\n2. Branch by including/excluding edges.\n3. Prune branches where `lower_bound \u2265 current_best_cost`.\n4. Update the best tour when a complete tour is found.\n\n---\n\n# **Mermaid Knowledge Graphs**\n## **Graph 1: Search Algorithms Hierarchy**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Search Algorithms] --> B[Uninformed Search]\n    A --> C[Informed Search]\n    A --> D[Adversarial Search]\n    A --> E[Constraint Satisfaction]\n    A --> F[Problem Decomposition]\n\n    B --> B1[BFS]\n    B --> B2[DFS]\n    B --> B3[Uniform Cost Search]\n    B --> B4[Branch-and-Bound]\n\n    C --> C1[Best-First Search]\n    C --> C2[A* Search]\n    C --> C3[AO* Algorithm]\n\n    D --> D1[Minimax]\n    D --> D2[Alpha-Beta Pruning]\n    D --> D3[SSS*]\n\n    E --> E1[Backtracking]\n    E --> E2[Arc Consistency]\n    E --> E3[Waltz Algorithm]\n\n    F --> F1[AND-OR Graphs]\n    F --> F2[AO* Algorithm]\n```\n\n## **Graph 2: A* Search Components**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[A* Search] --> B[Cost Function]\n    A --> C[Heuristic]\n    A --> D[Tie-Breakers]\n\n    B --> B1[f(n) = g(n) + h(n)]\n    B1 --> B2[g(n): Path Cost]\n    B1 --> B3[h(n): Heuristic]\n\n    C --> C1[Admissible]\n    C --> C2[Consistent]\n    C --> C3[Manhattan Distance]\n    C --> C4[Euclidean Distance]\n\n    D --> D1[Alphabetical Order]\n    D --> D2[Node Labels]\n```\n\n## **Graph 3: Game Tree Search**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Game Tree Search] --> B[Minimax]\n    A --> C[Alpha-Beta Pruning]\n    A --> D[SSS*]\n\n    B --> B1[MAX Player]\n    B --> B2[MIN Player]\n    B --> B3[Leaf Evaluation]\n\n    C --> C1[Alpha Bound]\n    C --> C2[Beta Bound]\n    C --> C3[Pruning]\n\n    D --> D1[A* + Game Tree]\n    D --> D2[SOLVED Status]\n    D --> D3[Tie-Breakers]\n```\n\n## **Graph 4: CSP (Constraint Satisfaction Problem)**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[CSP] --> B[Variables]\n    A --> C[Domains]\n    A --> D[Constraints]\n    A --> E[Algorithms]\n\n    E --> E1[Backtracking]\n    E --> E2[Arc Consistency]\n    E --> E3[Waltz Algorithm]\n\n    B --> B1[Edges]\n    B --> B2[Junctions]\n\n    D --> D1[Junction Types]\n    D --> D2[Label Consistency]\n```\n\n## **Graph 5: Automated Planning (Blocks World)**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Automated Planning] --> B[States]\n    A --> C[Operators]\n    A --> D[Preconditions]\n    A --> E[Effects]\n\n    C --> C1[Pickup]\n    C --> C2[Putdown]\n    C --> C3[Stack]\n    C --> C4[Unstack]\n\n    B --> B1[armEmpty]\n    B --> B2[holding(X)]\n    B --> B3[onTable(X)]\n    B --> B4[clear(X)]\n    B --> B5[on(X, Y)]\n\n    D --> D1[Applicable Actions]\n    E --> E1[Relevant Actions]\n    E --> E2[Mutex Actions]\n```\n\n## **Graph 6: Rule-Based Systems (Rete Algorithm)**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Rete Algorithm] --> B[Working Memory]\n    A --> C[Production Rules]\n    A --> D[Conflict Resolution]\n\n    B --> B1[Facts]\n    B --> B2[Timestamps]\n\n    C --> C1[Alpha Nodes]\n    C --> C2[Beta Nodes]\n    C --> C3[Conflict Set]\n\n    D --> D1[Specificity]\n    D --> D2[Recency]\n    D --> D3[Tie-Breakers]\n```\n\n## **Graph 7: AND-OR Graphs & AO***\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[AND-OR Graphs] --> B[AND Nodes]\n    A --> C[OR Nodes]\n    A --> D[Primitive Nodes]\n    A --> E[AO* Algorithm]\n\n    E --> E1[Cost Propagation]\n    E --> E2[Tie-Breakers]\n    E --> E3[Backpropagation]\n\n    B --> B1[All Children Must Solve]\n    C --> C1[Any Child Can Solve]\n    D --> D1[Terminal Nodes]\n```\n\n## **Graph 8: TSP Branch-and-Bound**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[TSP Branch-and-Bound] --> B[Branching]\n    A --> C[Bounding]\n    A --> D[Search Tree]\n\n    B --> B1[Include Edge XY]\n    B --> B2[Exclude Edge XY]\n\n    C --> C1[Lower Bound]\n    C --> C2[Pruning]\n\n    D --> D1[Partial Tours]\n    D --> D2[Optimal Tour]\n```",
