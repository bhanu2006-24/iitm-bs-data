        "summary": "Here\u2019s a structured **summary of core topics, concepts, principles, and equations** for the exam **\"AI: Search Methods for Problem Solving\"**, along with **Mermaid knowledge graphs** to visualize relationships.\n\n---\n\n## **1. Core Topics & Concepts**\n### **A. Search Algorithms**\n#### **1. Best-First Search (BFS)**\n- **Concept**: Expands the most promising node first based on a heuristic function (e.g., Manhattan Distance).\n- **Heuristic Function**: `h(n)` = estimated cost from node `n` to goal.\n- **Tie-Breaker**: If multiple nodes have the same cost, use **alphabetical order** (or node labels).\n- **Example Path (Q3)**: `S,A,B,F,G`\n- **Key Idea**: Greedy approach; may not guarantee the shortest path.\n\n#### **2. A* Search**\n- **Concept**: Combines **cost-so-far (g(n))** and **heuristic (h(n))** to select the next node.\n  - **Evaluation Function**: `f(n) = g(n) + h(n)`\n  - `g(n)` = actual cost from start to node `n`.\n  - `h(n)` = heuristic estimate (e.g., Manhattan Distance).\n- **Optimality**: Guarantees the shortest path if `h(n)` is **admissible** (never overestimates).\n- **Example Path (Q4)**: `S,C,B,F,G`\n- **Key Idea**: Balances exploration (Dijkstra) and greediness (BFS).\n\n#### **3. Branch-and-Bound (BnB)**\n- **Concept**: Systematically explores branches while **pruning** suboptimal paths using a **cost bound**.\n- **Variation**: Avoids cycles (e.g., `S,A,S,A,...`).\n- **Example Path (Q5)**: `S,C,D,E,H,I,G`\n- **Key Idea**: Finds the **optimal path** by eliminating worse alternatives early.\n\n#### **4. Admissibility of Heuristics (Q7)**\n- **Admissible Heuristic**: Never overestimates the true cost (`h(n) \u2264 h*(n)`).\n- **Inadmissible Heuristic**: Overestimates (`h(n) > h*(n)`).\n- **Example (Q7)**: The given heuristic is **inadmissible** (Manhattan Distance may overestimate in some grid configurations).\n\n---\n### **B. Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) with Branch-and-Bound**\n#### **1. Search Tree Exploration (Q8-Q11)**\n- **Node Selection**: Expand nodes in order of **lowest cost** (e.g., `S0 \u2192 b1 \u2192 c1 \u2192 d2 \u2192 c2`).\n- **Optimal Tour (Q9)**: Found at the node with the **minimum cost** (e.g., `e1,432`).\n- **Number of Cities (Q10)**: Determined by the **depth of the tree** (e.g., 6 cities).\n- **Optimal Path (Q11)**: `A,B,C,E,F,D` (start from `A`).\n\n#### **2. Pruning in TSP**\n- **Alpha-Beta Pruning (Q14)**: Eliminates branches that cannot improve the current best solution.\n  - **Pruned Nodes**: `C,E,F,I` (based on the given tree).\n- **SSS* Algorithm (Q15)**: Processes nodes in **best-first order**; unprocessed nodes: `B,C,E,F,I`.\n\n---\n### **C. Game Trees & Adversarial Search**\n#### **1. Minimax & Alpha-Beta Pruning (Q12-Q14)**\n- **Max Player Strategy (Q12)**: Chooses the path with the **highest minimax value** (e.g., `A,B`).\n- **Best Strategy Nodes (Q13)**: `G,H` (deepest nodes with highest values).\n- **Alpha-Beta Pruned Nodes (Q14)**: `C,E,F,I` (suboptimal branches).\n\n#### **2. Conflict Resolution in Rule-Based Systems (Q19-Q21)**\n- **Conflict Set (Q19)**: Rules that match working memory (e.g., `R1,205,206`).\n- **Specificity (Q20)**: Prioritizes **more specific rules** (e.g., `R3,204,207`).\n- **Recency (Q21)**: Prioritizes **most recent rules** (e.g., `R2,209`).\n\n---\n### **D. Automated Planning (Blocks World)**\n#### **1. Applicable Actions (Q22)**\n- **Start State**: `{armEmpty, on(A,B), on(C,D), clear(A), clear(C), onTable(B), onTable(D)}`\n- **Applicable Actions**:\n  - `Unstack(A,B)` (arm is empty, `A` is clear).\n  - `Unstack(C,D)` (arm is empty, `C` is clear).\n\n#### **2. Relevant Actions in Goal State (Q23)**\n- **Goal State**: `{on(A,C), on(C,B), onTable(B)}`\n- **Relevant Actions**:\n  - `Putdown(B)` (if holding `B`).\n  - `Stack(C,B)` (if holding `C` and `B` is clear).\n  - `Stack(A,C)` (if holding `A` and `C` is clear).\n\n#### **3. Mutex Actions/Propositions (Q24-Q25)**\n- **Mutex Actions (Layer 1)**:\n  - `Unstack(A,B)` and `Unstack(C,D)` (both require `armEmpty`).\n  - `Unstack(C,D)` and `NOP-action for armEmpty` (conflicting preconditions).\n- **Mutex Propositions**:\n  - `clear(B)` and `armEmpty` (cannot be true simultaneously if `B` is being unstacked).\n\n---\n### **E. Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP)**\n#### **1. Junction Labeling (Q26-Q27)**\n- **Trihedral Objects**: Assign **convex/concave/arrow** labels to edges in 2D line drawings.\n- **Consistent Assignments**:\n  - **Q26**: `Y1,W1,L1,W1` (valid for the given 3D structure).\n  - **Q27**: `NIL` (no consistent labeling possible).\n\n---\n### **F. Problem Decomposition (AND-OR Graphs)**\n#### **1. AO* Algorithm (Q16-Q18)**\n- **Node Expansion Order (Q16)**: `S,C,A` (prioritizes lowest heuristic cost).\n- **Start Node Value Updates (Q17)**:\n  - After 1st expansion: `13`\n  - After 2nd expansion: `16`\n  - After 3rd expansion: `13`\n- **Final Value of S (Q18)**: `18` (sum of solved subproblems).\n\n---\n## **2.
