        "summary": "Here\u2019s a structured **summary of core topics, concepts, principles, and equations** for the exam **\"AI: Search Methods for Problem Solving\"**, along with **Mermaid knowledge graphs** to visualize relationships.\n\n---\n\n## **1. Core Topics & Concepts**\n### **A. Search Algorithms**\n#### **1. Best-First Search (BFS)**\n- **Concept**: Explores nodes based on a heuristic evaluation function (`f(n) = h(n)`).\n- **Heuristic**: **Manhattan Distance** (for grid-based problems).\n  - Formula:\n    \\[\n    h(n) = |x_n - x_{goal}| + |y_n - y_{goal}|\n    \\]\n- **Tie-Breaker**: Alphabetical order of node labels.\n- **Example Path**: `S,C,F,G` (Question 3).\n\n#### **2. A* Search**\n- **Concept**: Combines **path cost (`g(n)`)** and **heuristic (`h(n)`)**.\n  - Formula:\n    \\[\n    f(n) = g(n) + h(n)\n    \\]\n  - `g(n)` = cost from start to node `n`.\n  - `h(n)` = Manhattan Distance (admissible heuristic).\n- **Optimality**: Guaranteed to find the shortest path if `h(n)` is admissible.\n- **Example Path**: `S,B,A,E,G` (Question 4).\n\n#### **3. Branch-and-Bound (BnB)**\n- **Concept**: Explores branches while keeping track of the **best-known solution (upper bound)**.\n  - Prunes branches where the **lower bound > current best solution**.\n- **Variation**: Avoids cyclic expansions (e.g., `S,B,S,B,...`).\n- **Example Path**: `S,B,A,E,G` (Question 5).\n- **Optimal Tour Cost**: `366` (Question 10).\n\n#### **4. Admissibility of Heuristics**\n- **Definition**: A heuristic `h(n)` is **admissible** if it **never overestimates** the true cost.\n- **Manhattan Distance**: Admissible for grid-based pathfinding (Question 7).\n\n---\n### **B. Game Trees & Adversarial Search**\n#### **1. Minimax & Alpha-Beta Pruning**\n- **Minimax**: Recursively evaluates game states assuming optimal play.\n- **Alpha-Beta Pruning**: Reduces search space by pruning branches that cannot influence the final decision.\n  - **Example**: Inspected nodes in Alpha-Beta: `A,B,E,I` (Question 15).\n- **Best Strategy for MAX Player**:\n  - **Leaf Nodes**: `A,C,D` (Question 14).\n  - **Optimal Path**: `I,K` or `E,F` (Question 13).\n\n#### **2. SSS* Algorithm**\n- **Concept**: A **depth-first** variant of Alpha-Beta that explores the most promising paths first.\n- **Solved Nodes**: `A,B,E,I` (Question 16).\n\n---\n### **C. Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP)**\n#### **1. Arc Consistency**\n- **Definition**: A CSP is **arc-consistent** if every value in a variable\u2019s domain satisfies all binary constraints.\n- **Example**: Given domains for `A, B, C` (all adjacent), the CSP is **arc-consistent** (Question 27).\n\n#### **2. Path Consistency**\n- **Definition**: Ensures consistency along all paths of length \u2265 2.\n- **Example**: The given CSP is **not path-consistent** (Question 28).\n\n#### **3. Solution Existence**\n- **Example Solution**: `A=g, B=r, C=b` (Question 29).\n\n---\n### **D. AND-OR Graphs & AO* Algorithm**\n#### **1. Problem Decomposition**\n- **AND Nodes**: All children must be solved.\n- **OR Nodes**: Any child can be solved.\n- **Cost Propagation**:\n  - Edge cost = `2` (fixed).\n  - **Tie-Breakers**:\n    1. Alphabetical order.\n    2. For AND nodes, expand the **highest-cost unsolved branch**.\n- **Example Expansion Order**: `S,B,A` (Question 17).\n- **Final Value of `S`**: `56` (Question 19).\n\n---\n### **E. Automated Planning (Blocks World)**\n#### **1. Predicates & Operators**\n| Predicate       | Description                          |\n|-----------------|--------------------------------------|\n| `armEmpty`      | Robot arm is empty.                  |\n| `holding(X)`    | Robot holds block `X`.               |\n| `onTable(X)`    | Block `X` is on the table.           |\n| `clear(X)`      | Nothing is on top of `X`.            |\n| `on(X, Y)`      | `X` is directly on `Y`.              |\n\n| Operator        | Preconditions                     | Effects (Add/Del)               |\n|-----------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| `Pickup(X)`     | `armEmpty, clear(X), onTable(X)`  | `holding(X)`, delete `armEmpty`  |\n| `Putdown(X)`    | `holding(X)`                      | `armEmpty, onTable(X)`           |\n| `Unstack(X, Y)` | `armEmpty, clear(X), on(X, Y)`    | `holding(X), clear(Y)`           |\n| `Stack(X, Y)`   | `holding(X), clear(Y)`            | `on(X, Y), armEmpty`             |\n\n#### **2.

Exam Tips**\n1. **Understand Heuristics**:\n   - Manhattan Distance is **admissible** for grid paths.\n   - A* is **optimal** if `h(n)` is admissible.\n2. **Game Trees**:\n   - **Minimax** explores all paths; **Alpha-Beta** prunes.\n   - **SSS*** is a **depth-first** variant.\n3. **CSP**:\n   - **Arc consistency** \u2260 **path consistency**.\n   - Check for **solution existence** via backtracking.\n4. **AO***:\n   - Expand **highest-cost unsolved branches** first.\n   - Update costs **bottom-up**.\n5. **Planning**:\n   - **Mutex actions/propositions** cannot co-occur.\n   - **Relevant actions** must contribute to the goal.\n6. **Rete Net**:\n   - **Specificity** > **Recency** in conflict resolution.",
