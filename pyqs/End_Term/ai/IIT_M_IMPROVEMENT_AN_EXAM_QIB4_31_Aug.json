        "summary": "Here\u2019s a structured **summary of core topics, concepts, principles, and equations** for the exam **\"AI: Search Methods for Problem Solving\"**, along with **Mermaid knowledge graphs** to visualize relationships.\n\n---\n\n## **1. Core Topics & Concepts**\n### **A. Search Algorithms**\n#### **1. Best-First Search (BFS)**\n   - **Concept**: Explores nodes based on a heuristic evaluation function (`f(n) = h(n)`).\n   - **Heuristic Used**: **Manhattan Distance** (for grid-based problems).\n     - Formula:\n       \\[\n       h(n) = |x_n - x_{goal}| + |y_n - y_{goal}|\n       \\]\n   - **Tie-Breaker**: Alphabetical order of node labels.\n   - **Example Path (Q3)**: `S,C,F,G`\n\n#### **2. A* Search**\n   - **Concept**: Combines cost-to-reach (`g(n)`) and heuristic (`h(n)`).\n     - Formula:\n       \\[\n       f(n) = g(n) + h(n)\n       \\]\n   - **Heuristic**: Manhattan Distance.\n   - **Example Path (Q4)**: `S,B,A,E,G`\n\n#### **3. Branch-and-Bound (BnB)**\n   - **Concept**: Prunes branches that cannot yield a better solution than the current best.\n   - **Variation**: Avoids cyclic expansions (e.g., `S,B,S,B,...`).\n   - **Example Path (Q5)**: `S,B,A,E,G`\n   - **Optimal Tour Cost (Q10)**: `366` (for TSP).\n\n#### **4. Game Trees (Minimax, Alpha-Beta Pruning, SSS*)**\n   - **Minimax**: Alternates between MAX (maximizing) and MIN (minimizing) players.\n   - **Alpha-Beta Pruning**: Reduces search space by pruning branches.\n     - **Leaf Nodes Inspected (Q15)**: `A,B,E,I`\n   - **SSS***: Combines depth-first and best-first search.\n     - **Leaf Nodes Solved (Q16)**: `A,B,E,I`\n   - **MAX Player Strategy (Q13, Q14)**:\n     - Example: `A,C,D` (leaf nodes in best strategy).\n\n#### **5. AO* (AND-OR Search)**\n   - **Concept**: Solves AND-OR graphs by expanding nodes with heuristic estimates.\n   - **Heuristic**: Cost estimates in nodes (e.g., `S=20`, `A=35`).\n   - **Nodes Expanded (Q17)**: `S,B,A`\n   - **Final Value of S (Q19)**: `56`\n   - **Values After Expansion (Q18)**: `34,37,56`\n\n#### **6. Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP)**\n   - **Arc Consistency (Q27)**: Ensures no arc violates constraints.\n     - **Example**: Yes (for given map coloring).\n   - **Path Consistency (Q28)**: Ensures consistency along all paths.\n     - **Example**: No (for given map coloring).\n   - **Solution (Q29)**: `g,r,b` (for regions A, B, C).\n\n#### **7. Automated Planning (Blocks World)**\n   - **Predicates**:\n     - `armEmpty`, `holding(X)`, `onTable(X)`, `clear(X)`, `on(X,Y)`.\n   - **Operators**:\n     - `Pickup(X)`, `Putdown(X)`, `Unstack(X,Y)`, `Stack(X,Y)`.\n   - **Applicable Actions (Q23)**: `Unstack(D,A)`, `Unstack(E,B)`, `Pickup(C)`.\n   - **Relevant Actions (Q24)**: `Stack(A,B)`, `Stack(B,C)`.\n   - **Mutex Pairs (Q25, Q26)**:\n     - **Actions**: `Unstack(D,A)` & `Pickup(C)` (Layer 1).\n     - **Propositions**: `clear(A)` & `holding(E)`.\n\n#### **8. Rule-Based Expert Systems (Rete Net)**\n   - **Conflict Resolution Strategies**:\n     1. **Specificity (Q21)**: Most specific rule fires first.\n        - Example: `(Windmill, 105, 104)`.\n     2. **Recency (Q22)**: Most recent WME (Working Memory Element) fires first.\n        - Example: `(Rocket, 107)`.\n   - **Conflict Set (Q20)**:\n     - `(Liquid-Fuel-Rocket, 102, 107)`, `(Windmill, 105, 104)`, `(Generator, 104)`, `(Generator, 106)`, `(Rocket, 107)`.\n\n---\n\n## **2. Key Equations**\n| **Concept**               | **Equation**                                                                 |\n|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Manhattan Distance**     | \\( h(n) = |x_n - x_{goal}| + |y_n - y_{goal}| \\)                              |\n| **A* Evaluation Function** | \\( f(n) = g(n) + h(n) \\)                                                    |\n| **TSP Optimal Tour Cost**  | Minimize \\( \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\text{dist}(c_i, c_{i+1}) \\) (where \\( c_{n+1} = c_1 \\)) |\n| **AO* Node Value Update**  | \\( h(S) = \\text{min/max}(h(\\text{children}) + \\text{edge cost}) \\)         |\n\n---\n\n## **3.

Exam Tips**\n1. **Understand Heuristics**:\n   - Manhattan Distance is critical for grid-based searches.\n   - Admissibility (Q7): A heuristic is admissible if it never overestimates the true cost.\n\n2. **Tie-Breakers**:\n   - Alphabetical order for nodes (e.g., `A` before `B`).\n   - Deepest/leftmost for game trees.\n\n3. **CSP**:\n   - Arc consistency \u2260 path consistency.\n   - Solutions must satisfy all constraints (e.g., `g,r,b` for map coloring).\n\n4. **Planning**:\n   - **Applicable Actions**: Check preconditions in the start state.\n   - **Relevant Actions**: Actions that contribute to the goal.\n\n5. **Rule-Based Systems**:\n   - **Specificity**: More conditions \u2192 higher priority.\n   - **Recency**: Newer WMEs fire first.\n\n6. **AO***:\n   - Expands nodes with the highest heuristic cost first.\n   - Updates parent node values after child expansion.\n\n7. **TSP BnB**:\n   - Optimal tour is the leaf node with the lowest cost.\n   - Number of cities = number of unique labels in edges.",
