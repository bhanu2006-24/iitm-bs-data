Core Topics & Concepts**\n### **A. Search Algorithms**\n#### **1. Best-First Search (BFS)**\n   - **Concept**: Explores nodes based on a heuristic evaluation function (e.g., Manhattan Distance).\n   - **Tie-Breaker**: Alphabetical order of node labels.\n   - **Example Path (Q3)**: `S,A,B,F,G`\n   - **Heuristic**: Manhattan Distance (for grid-based problems).\n     - Formula:\n       \\[\n       h(n) = |x_n - x_{goal}| + |y_n - y_{goal}|\n       \\]\n   - **Cost Function**:\n     \\[\n     f(n) = g(n) + h(n)\n     \\]\n     where:\n     - \\( g(n) \\): Path cost from start to node \\( n \\).\n     - \\( h(n) \\): Heuristic estimate from \\( n \\) to goal.\n\n#### **2. A* Search**\n   - **Concept**: Combines Dijkstra\u2019s algorithm (path cost) and heuristic guidance.\n   - **Optimality**: Guaranteed if the heuristic is **admissible** (never overestimates true cost).\n   - **Example Path (Q4)**: `S,C,B,F,G`\n   - **Heuristic Admissibility (Q7)**:\n     - **Admissible**: \\( h(n) \\leq \\text{true cost} \\).\n     - **Inadmissible**: \\( h(n) > \\text{true cost} \\) (e.g., Manhattan Distance in Q7 is **inadmissible**).\n\n#### **3. Branch-and-Bound (BnB)**\n   - **Concept**: Systematic enumeration of candidate solutions, pruning suboptimal branches.\n   - **Variation**: Avoids cyclic expansions (e.g., `S,A,S,A,...`).\n   - **Example Path (Q5)**: `S,C,D,E,H,I,G`\n   - **Optimal Path (Q6)**: Found by BnB (not A*).\n   - **Search Tree (Q8-Q11)**:\n     - **Node Refinement Order**: `b1,c1,d2,c2` (Q8).\n     - **Optimal Tour (Q9)**: Node `e1` with cost `432`.\n     - **Number of Cities (Q10)**: 6 (derived from edge constraints in the tree).\n     - **Optimal Tour Path (Q11)**: `A,B,C,E,F,D`.\n\n#### **4.

Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP)**\n   - **Concept**: Assigns labels to edges/junctions in 2D line drawings (e.g., trihedral objects).\n   - **Junction Types**: L, W, Y, T (with labels like `L1`, `Y2`, etc.).\n   - **Consistency Check (Q26-Q27)**:\n     - **Consistent Assignment (Q26)**: `Y1,W1,L1,W1`.\n     - **Inconsistent Drawing (Q27)**: `NIL` (no valid assignment).\n\n#### **7. Rete Algorithm (Rule-Based Systems)**\n   - **Concept**: Efficient pattern-matching for production rules (e.g., mushroom classification).\n   - **Conflict Set (Q19)**: Rules triggered by working memory (e.g., `R1,205,206`).\n   - **Conflict Resolution Strategies**:\n     - **Specificity (Q20)**: Prioritizes more specific rules (e.g., `R3,204,207`).\n     - **Recency (Q21)**: Prioritizes recently added facts (e.g., `R2,209`).\n\n#### **8. Automated Planning (Blocks World)**\n   - **Predicates**:\n     - `armEmpty`, `holding(X)`, `onTable(X)`, `clear(X)`, `on(X,Y)`.\n   - **Operators**:\n     - **Pickup(X)**, **Putdown(X)**, **Unstack(X,Y)**, **Stack(X,Y)**.\n   - **Applicable Actions (Q22)**: `Unstack(A,B)`, `Unstack(C,D)`.\n   - **Relevant Actions (Q23)**: `Putdown(B)`, `Stack(C,B)`, `Stack(A,C)`.\n   - **Mutex Actions (Q24)**: Pairs like `Unstack(A,B)` and `NOP-action for armEmpty`.\n   - **Mutex Propositions (Q25)**: `clear(B)` and `armEmpty`.\n\n---\n\n## **2.
