Search Algorithms**\n### **Core Concepts**\n- **State Space**: Representation of problems as graphs (nodes = states, edges = actions).\n- **Heuristics**: Estimates of cost from a node to the goal (e.g., **Manhattan Distance**).\n- **Tie-Breakers**: Use node labels or reference numbers when costs are equal.\n- **Admissibility**: A heuristic is admissible if it never overestimates the true cost.\n\n### **Algorithms**\n| Algorithm          | Description                                                                                     | Key Equation/Property                                                                 |\n|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Best-First Search** | Expands the most promising node first (using heuristic).                                         | `f(n) = h(n)` (only heuristic)                                                        |\n| **A***              | Combines cost-so-far (`g(n)`) and heuristic (`h(n)`). Guarantees optimality if `h(n)` is admissible. | `f(n) = g(n) + h(n)`                                                                  |\n| **Branch-and-Bound** | Explores branches systematically, prunes suboptimal paths.                                       | Prunes if `cost > current best solution`.                                            |\n| **AO***             | And-Or graph search for problem decomposition. Uses `h(n)` and edge costs.                     | `f(n) = g(n) + h(n)` (similar to A*, but for AND-OR graphs).                         |\n\n### **Key Observations from Questions**\n- **Best-First Search** (Q3): Path `S,C,F,G` (prioritizes heuristic over path cost).\n- **A*** (Q4): Path `S,B,A,E,G` (balances `g(n)` and `h(n)`).\n- **Branch-and-Bound** (Q5): Same as A* in this case (`S,B,A,E,G`).\n- **Admissibility** (Q7): Manhattan Distance is admissible for grid-based problems.\n\n---\n\n## **2. Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) with Branch-and-Bound**\n### **Core Concepts**\n- **State-Space Tree**: Nodes represent partial tours; edges represent inclusion/exclusion of edges.\n- **Pruning**: Eliminate subtrees where the lower bound > current best solution.\n- **Optimal Tour**: The least-cost Hamiltonian cycle.\n\n### **Key Equations**\n- **Lower Bound**: Sum of:\n  - Cost of edges included in the partial tour.\n  - Minimum possible cost for remaining edges (e.g., using **Minimum Spanning Tree** or **Nearest Neighbor**).\n- **Cost of Tour**: Sum of weights of all edges in the tour.\n\n### **Observations from Questions**\n- **Optimal Tour** (Q9-Q12):\n  - Node `d5` represents the optimal tour (Q9).\n  - Cost = `366` (Q10).\n  - Number of cities = `5` (A, B, C, D, E) (Q11).\n  - Path: `A,B,D,C,E` (Q12).\n- **Search Order** (Q8): `b1,c1,d2,b2` (prioritizes lowest bounds).\n\n---\n\n## **3. Game Trees and Adversarial Search**\n### **Core Concepts**\n- **Minimax**: Alternates between MAX (maximizing player) and MIN (minimizing player).\n- **Alpha-Beta Pruning**: Reduces search space by pruning branches that cannot influence the final decision.\n- **SSS*** (Simplified Memory-Bounded Search): Combines depth-first and breadth-first strategies.\n- **Evaluation Function**: Assigns a value to leaf nodes (e.g., `77`, `42`).\n\n### **Key Observations**\n- **MAX Player Strategy** (Q13-Q14):\n  - Best leaf nodes: `A,C,D` (Q14).\n  - Strategies: `(E,F)` or `(I,K)` (Q13).\n- **Alpha-Beta Pruning** (Q15): Inspects nodes `A,B,E,I`.\n- **SSS*** (Q16): Solves all leaf nodes (`A,B,E,I`).\n\n---\n\n## **4. Problem Decomposition (AND-OR Graphs)**\n### **Core Concepts**\n- **AND Nodes**: All children must be solved (e.g., decomposing a problem into subproblems).\n- **OR Nodes**: Any child can be solved (e.g., choosing between alternative solutions).\n- **AO*** Algorithm: Extends A* to AND-OR graphs.\n  - `f(n) = g(n) + h(n)` (same as A*, but handles AND/OR branches).\n  - **Edge Cost**: Typically `2` units (as in Q17-Q19).\n\n### **Observations from Questions**\n- **Expanded Nodes** (Q17): `S,B,A` (prioritizes highest heuristic or lowest cost).\n- **Final Value of S** (Q19): `56` (sum of edge costs + heuristic).\n- **Intermediate Values** (Q18): `34,37,56` (updates as nodes are expanded).\n\n---\n\n## **5. Rule-Based Expert Systems (Rete Algorithm)**\n### **Core Concepts**\n- **Working Memory (WM)**: Facts (e.g., `(Fuel ^item N59 ^type solid)`).\n- **Conflict Set**: Rules whose conditions match WM facts.\n- **Conflict Resolution Strategies**:\n  - **Specificity**: Prioritize more specific rules.\n  - **Recency**: Prioritize newer facts.\n- **Rete Network**: Efficiently matches rules to facts using alpha/beta nodes.\n\n### **Observations from Questions**\n- **Conflict Set** (Q20): `(Windmill, 105, 104)`, `(Generator, 104)`, etc.\n- **Specificity** (Q21): Fires `(Windmill, 105, 104)` first.\n- **Recency** (Q22): Fires `(Rocket, 107)` first (most recent fact).\n\n---\n\n## **6. Automated Planning (Blocks World)**\n### **Core Concepts**\n- **Predicates**: `armEmpty`, `holding(X)`, `on(X,Y)`, `clear(X)`, `onTable(X)`.\n- **Operators**: `Pickup`, `Putdown`, `Stack`, `Unstack`.\n- **Planning Graph**:\n  - **Layer 0**: Initial state.\n  - **Layer 1**: Applicable actions (mutex if they interfere).\n  - **Mutex Actions/Propositions**: Cannot occur simultaneously (e.g., `Unstack(D,A)` and `Pickup(C)` are not mutex if they don\u2019t interfere).\n\n### **Observations from Questions**\n- **Applicable Actions** (Q23): `Unstack(D,A)`, `Unstack(E,B)`, `Pickup(C)`.\n- **Relevant Actions** (Q24): `Stack(A,B)`, `Stack(B,C)` (directly contribute to the goal).\n- **Mutex Pairs** (Q25-Q26):\n  - Actions: `Unstack(D,A)` and `Pickup(C)` are **not** mutex (Q25).\n  - Propositions: `clear(A)` and `holding(E)` are mutex (Q26).\n\n---\n\n## **7. Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP)**\n### **Core Concepts**\n- **Variables**: Regions `A, B, C`.\n- **Domains**: Possible values (e.g., colors `{r, b, g}`).\n- **Constraints**: Adjacent regions cannot share colors.\n- **Consistency**:\n  - **Arc Consistency**: For every value in `A`, there exists a valid value in `B`.\n  - **Path Consistency**: Extends arc consistency to paths of length 2.\n\n### **Observations from Questions**\n- **Arc Consistency** (Q27): **Yes** (all domains are valid given constraints).\n- **Path Consistency** (Q28): **No** (e.g., `A=g`, `B=r`, but `C` has no valid color).\n- **Solution** (Q29): `g,r,b` (assigns colors to `A,B,C` without conflicts).\n\n---\n\n## **Mermaid Knowledge Graphs**\n### **1.
