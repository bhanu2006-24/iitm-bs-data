        "summary": "Here\u2019s a structured summary of the core topics, concepts, and principles essential for the exam on **\"AI: Search Methods for Problem Solving\"**, along with key equations, knowledge graphs, and explanations.\n\n---\n\n## **Core Topics and Concepts**\n\n### **1. Search Algorithms**\n#### **Key Concepts:**\n- **Best-First Search (BFS):**\n  - Uses a priority queue (typically a min-heap) to explore nodes with the lowest evaluation function first.\n  - **Evaluation Function:** `f(n) = g(n) + h(n)` (where `g(n)` is the cost from start to node `n`, and `h(n)` is the heuristic estimate from `n` to the goal).\n  - For **Best-First Search (Greedy)**, `f(n) = h(n)`.\n  - **Tie-Breaker:** If multiple nodes have the same `f(n)`, use alphabetical order or node labels.\n\n- **A* Search:**\n  - Combines the benefits of Dijkstra\u2019s algorithm (cost-so-far) and Greedy Best-First Search (heuristic).\n  - **Evaluation Function:** `f(n) = g(n) + h(n)`.\n  - **Optimality:** Guaranteed to find the shortest path if the heuristic `h(n)` is **admissible** (never overestimates the true cost).\n  - **Manhattan Distance Heuristic:** `h(n) = |x_n - x_goal| + |y_n - y_goal|` (for grid-based pathfinding).\n\n- **Branch-and-Bound (BnB):**\n  - Systematically explores branches of a search tree while keeping track of the best solution found so far.\n  - **Pruning:** Eliminates branches that cannot yield a better solution than the current best.\n  - Used in optimization problems like the **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)**.\n\n- **Admissibility of Heuristics:**\n  - A heuristic `h(n)` is **admissible** if it never overestimates the true cost to reach the goal.\n  - **Example:** Manhattan Distance is admissible for grid-based pathfinding if movement is restricted to 4 directions (no diagonals).\n\n#### **Key Equations:**\n1. **Best-First Search (Greedy):**\n   \\[\n   f(n) = h(n)\n   \\]\n2. **A* Search:**\n   \\[\n   f(n) = g(n) + h(n)\n   \\]\n   - `g(n)` = cost from start to node `n`.\n   - `h(n)` = heuristic estimate from `n` to goal.\n3. **Manhattan Distance (for grids):**\n   \\[\n   h(n) = |x_n - x_{goal}| + |y_n - y_{goal}|\n   \\]\n\n---\n\n### **2. Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) with Branch-and-Bound**\n#### **Key Concepts:**\n- **Branch-and-Bound for TSP:**\n  - Constructs a search tree where each node represents a partial tour.\n  - **Lower Bound:** Estimates the minimum possible cost of completing a tour from a partial solution.\n  - **Pruning:** Discards branches where the lower bound exceeds the current best solution.\n  - **Optimal Tour:** The tour with the minimum total cost.\n\n#### **Key Observations from Questions:**\n- The **optimal tour cost** is found at the leaf node with the smallest value (e.g., `f1, 412` in Q9).\n- The **number of cities** can be inferred from the edges (e.g., 5 cities in Q10: A, B, C, D, E).\n- **Order of Node Expansion:** Nodes are expanded based on the lowest cost (e.g., `b1, c2, b2, c3` in Q8).\n\n#### **Key Equations:**\n1. **Lower Bound Calculation (for TSP):**\n   - Sum of the two smallest edges for each city (if not already included in the partial tour).\n   - Example: For cities A, B, C, D, E, the lower bound for a partial tour `A-B-C` might be:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Lower Bound} = \\text{Cost}(A-B) + \\text{Cost}(B-C) + \\text{Min Edge}(C \\rightarrow D,E) + \\text{Min Edge}(A \\rightarrow D,E)\n     \\]\n\n---\n\n### **3. Game Trees and Adversarial Search**\n#### **Key Concepts:**\n- **Minimax Algorithm:**\n  - **MAX Player:** Aims to maximize the score.\n  - **MIN Player:** Aims to minimize the score.\n  - **Evaluation Function:** Assigns a value to terminal (horizon) nodes.\n- **Alpha-Beta Pruning:**\n  - Reduces the number of nodes evaluated by pruning branches that cannot influence the final decision.\n  - **Alpha (`\u03b1`):** Best value for MAX so far.\n  - **Beta (`\u03b2`):** Best value for MIN so far.\n- **SSS* Algorithm:**\n  - A variant of Alpha-Beta that explores the most promising paths first.\n\n#### **Key Observations from Questions:**\n- **Best Strategy for MAX:** Choose the path with the highest minimax value (e.g., `G, I` in Q13).\n- **Pruned Nodes in Alpha-Beta:** Nodes that are not explored because they are dominated by `\u03b1` or `\u03b2` (e.g., `C, E, F` in Q14).\n- **Unprocessed Nodes in SSS*:** Nodes that are neither **LIVE** (being evaluated) nor **SOLVED** (e.g., `B, C, E, F` in Q15).\n\n#### **Key Equations:**\n1. **Minimax Value for MAX Node:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Value}(n) = \\max(\\text{Value}(child_1), \\text{Value}(child_2), ...)\n   \\]\n2. **Minimax Value for MIN Node:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Value}(n) = \\min(\\text{Value}(child_1), \\text{Value}(child_2), ...)\n   \\]\n3. **Alpha-Beta Pruning Condition:**\n   - For a MAX node, if `\u03b2 \u2264 \u03b1`, prune the remaining children.\n   - For a MIN node, if `\u03b1 \u2265 \u03b2`, prune the remaining children.\n\n---\n\n### **4. AND-OR Graphs and AO* Algorithm**\n#### **Key Concepts:**\n- **AND-OR Graphs:**\n  - **OR Nodes:** Represent choices (any child can be selected).\n  - **AND Nodes:** Represent conjunctive subgoals (all children must be solved).\n- **AO* Algorithm:**\n  - Extends A* to AND-OR graphs.\n  - **Evaluation Function:** Uses a combination of `g(n)` (cost to reach `n`) and `h(n)` (heuristic estimate).\n  - **Tie-Breakers:**\n    1. If costs are equal, prefer nodes alphabetically.\n    2. For AND nodes, select the unsolved branch with the highest cost.\n\n#### **Key Observations from Questions:**\n- **First Expanded Nodes:** `S, C, A` (Q16).\n- **Value Updates for S:** `19, 21, 22` after expanding the first 3 nodes (Q17).\n- **Final Value of S:** `20` (Q18).\n\n#### **Key Equations:**\n1. **Cost of an AND Node:**\n   \\[\n   f(n) = \\sum_{child \\in \\text{AND children}} f(child)\n   \\]\n2. **Cost of an OR Node:**\n   \\[\n   f(n) = \\min(f(child_1), f(child_2), ...)\n   \\]\n\n---\n\n### **5. Rule-Based Expert Systems (Rete Algorithm)**\n#### **Key Concepts:**\n- **Rete Algorithm:**\n  - Efficient pattern-matching algorithm for rule-based systems.\n  - **Alpha Network:** Matches working memory elements (WMEs) to rule conditions.\n  - **Beta Network:** Joins partial matches to form complete rule instantiations.\n- **Conflict Resolution Strategies:**\n  - **Recency:** Prefer rules matching the most recent WMEs.\n  - **Specificity:** Prefer rules with more conditions (more specific).\n\n#### **Key Observations from Questions:**\n- **Conflict Set (Recency):** `R1,107` (Q21).\n- **Conflict Set (Specificity):** `R3,103,106` and `R4,101,105` (Q20).\n\n---\n\n### **6.
