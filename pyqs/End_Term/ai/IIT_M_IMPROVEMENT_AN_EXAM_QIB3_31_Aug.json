        "summary": "Here\u2019s a structured **summary of core topics, concepts, principles, and equations** for the exam on **\"AI: Search Methods for Problem Solving\"**, along with **Mermaid knowledge graphs** to visualize relationships.\n\n---\n\n## **1. Core Topics & Concepts**\n### **A. Search Algorithms**\n#### **1. Best-First Search (BFS)**\n   - **Concept**: Explores nodes based on a heuristic evaluation function (e.g., Manhattan Distance).\n   - **Tie-Breaker**: Alphabetical order or node labels.\n   - **Example**: Path `S,C,F,G` (Q3).\n   - **Heuristic**: Manhattan Distance (for grid-based problems).\n     - Formula:\n       \\[\n       h(n) = |x_n - x_{goal}| + |y_n - y_{goal}|\n       \\]\n   - **Properties**:\n     - **Not guaranteed to be optimal** (depends on heuristic).\n     - **Complete** if the branching factor is finite.\n\n#### **2. A* Search**\n   - **Concept**: Combines **cost-so-far (g(n))** and **heuristic (h(n))** to evaluate nodes.\n     - Evaluation function: \\( f(n) = g(n) + h(n) \\).\n   - **Optimality**: Guaranteed if the heuristic is **admissible** (never overestimates the true cost).\n   - **Example**: Path `S,B,A,E,G` (Q4).\n   - **Admissibility Check**: Heuristic must satisfy \\( h(n) \\leq h^*(n) \\) (true for Manhattan Distance in grid worlds).\n\n#### **3. Branch-and-Bound (BnB)**\n   - **Concept**: Systematic enumeration of candidate solutions by **pruning suboptimal branches**.\n   - **Variation**: Avoids cycles (e.g., `S,B,S,B,...`).\n   - **Example**: Path `S,B,A,E,G` (Q5).\n   - **Key Steps**:\n     1. **Bound Calculation**: Lower/upper bounds for partial solutions.\n     2. **Pruning**: Discard branches where the bound exceeds the best-known solution.\n   - **Application**: Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP).\n\n#### **4. Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) with BnB**\n   - **Search Tree Structure**:\n     - Nodes represent **partial tours** (e.g., `AC`, `\u00acBD`).\n     - **Cost**: Total distance of the partial tour.\n     - **Optimal Tour**: Lowest-cost complete tour (e.g., cost `366` in Q10).\n   - **Key Observations**:\n     - **Number of Cities**: Determined by the depth of the tree (e.g., 5 cities in Q11).\n     - **Optimal Path**: Extracted from the leaf node with the minimal cost (e.g., `A,B,D,C,E` in Q12).\n   - **BnB Steps**:\n     1. Start with an initial bound (e.g., `305`).\n     2. Refine nodes in order of increasing cost (e.g., `b1,c1,d2,b2` in Q8).\n     3. Prune branches where the partial cost exceeds the current best solution.\n\n#### **5. Game Trees (Minimax, Alpha-Beta Pruning, SSS*)**\n   - **Minimax**:\n     - **MAX Player**: Maximizes utility.\n     - **MIN Player**: Minimizes utility.\n     - **Example**: Best strategy for MAX includes leaf nodes `A,C,D` (Q14).\n   - **Alpha-Beta Pruning**:\n     - **Concept**: Prunes branches that cannot influence the final decision.\n     - **Example**: Inspected nodes `A,B,E,I` (Q15).\n   - **SSS***:\n     - **Concept**: Combines depth-first and best-first search for game trees.\n     - **Example**: Solves all leaf nodes `A,C,D,E,F,G,H,I,J,K` (Q16).\n\n#### **6. AND-OR Graphs & AO* Algorithm**\n   - **Concept**: Decomposes problems into **AND/OR subproblems**.\n     - **AND Nodes**: All children must be solved.\n     - **OR Nodes**: Any child can be solved.\n   - **Heuristic**: Estimated cost to solve a node.\n   - **Example**:\n     - Expanded nodes: `S,B,A` (Q17).\n     - Final value of `S`: `56` (Q19).\n   - **Cost Calculation**:\n     - Edge cost: `2 units` (fixed).\n     - Node value updates: `34,37,56` (Q18).\n\n#### **7. Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP)**\n   - **Arc Consistency**:\n     - **Definition**: For every value in \\( D_A \\), there exists a value in \\( D_B \\) that satisfies the constraint \\( (A,B) \\).\n     - **Example**: Given CSP is arc-consistent (Q27).\n   - **Path Consistency**:\n     - **Definition**: For every pair of variables \\( (A,C) \\), all constraints along the path \\( A \\rightarrow B \\rightarrow C \\) are satisfied.\n     - **Example**: Given CSP is **not** path-consistent (Q28).\n   - **Solution Existence**:\n     - **Backtracking Search**: Assigns values to variables while checking constraints.\n     - **Example Solution**: `A=g, B=r, C=b` (Q29).\n\n#### **8. Rule-Based Expert Systems (Rete Net)**\n   - **Conflict Set**: Rules whose preconditions are satisfied by working memory elements (WMEs).\n   - **Conflict Resolution Strategies**:\n     1. **Specificity**: Prefer rules with more conditions.\n     2. **Recency**: Prefer rules matching newer WMEs.\n   - **Example**:\n     - Conflict set includes `(Windmill, 105, 104)` (Q20).\n     - **Specificity** fires `(Windmill, 105, 104)` first (Q21).\n     - **Recency** fires `(Rocket, 107)` first (Q22).\n\n#### **9. Automated Planning (Blocks World)**\n   - **Predicates**:\n     - `armEmpty`, `holding(X)`, `onTable(X)`, `clear(X)`, `on(X,Y)`.\n   - **Operators**:\n     - **Pickup(X)**, **Putdown(X)**, **Unstack(X,Y)**, **Stack(X,Y)**.\n   - **Applicable Actions**:\n     - Must satisfy preconditions in the current state (e.g., `Unstack(D,A)` in Q23).\n   - **Relevant Actions**:\n     - Actions whose effects match the goal (e.g., `Stack(A,B)` in Q24).\n   - **Mutex (Mutual Exclusion)**:\n     - **Action Pairs**: Two actions cannot both be in a valid plan (e.g., `Unstack(D,A)` and `Pickup(C)` in Q25).\n     - **Proposition Pairs**: Two propositions cannot both be true (e.g., `clear(A)` and `holding(E)` in Q26).\n\n---\n\n## **2.

Exam Preparation Checklist**\n### **Must-Know Concepts**\n1. **Search Algorithms**:\n   - Best-First, A*, Branch-and-Bound (differences, optimality, completeness).\n   - Heuristics: Admissibility, Manhattan/Euclidean distance.\n2. **Game Trees**:\n   - Minimax, Alpha-Beta pruning, SSS*.\n   - Tie-breakers (depth, leftmost).\n3. **CSP**:\n   - Arc consistency, path consistency, backtracking.\n   - Heuristics: Minimum Remaining Values (MRV), Least Constraining Value (LCV).\n4. **Automated Planning**:\n   - Predicates, operators, mutex actions/propositions.\n   - Planning graph layers.\n5. **Rule-Based Systems**:\n   - Rete algorithm, conflict resolution (specificity, recency).\n6. **AND-OR Graphs**:\n   - AO* algorithm, node expansion order, cost updates.\n7. **TSP with BnB**:\n   - Search tree refinement, optimal tour extraction.\n\n### **Problem-Solving Tips**\n- **For Pathfinding (Q3-Q6)**:\n  - Calculate `f(n) = g(n) + h(n)` for A*.\n  - For Best-First, use only `h(n)`.\n  - For BnB, track partial path costs and prune dominated branches.\n- **For TSP (Q8-Q12)**:\n  - Refine nodes in order of increasing lower bound.\n  - The optimal tour is the leaf node with the minimal cost.\n- **For Game Trees (Q13-Q16)**:\n  - MAX selects the highest utility; MIN selects the lowest.\n  - Alpha-Beta prunes branches where `\u03b1 \u2265 \u03b2`.\n- **For CSP (Q27-Q29)**:\n  - Check arc consistency by ensuring every value in \\( D_A \\) has a compatible value in \\( D_B \\).\n  - For path consistency, extend to triplets \\( (A,B,C) \\).\n- **For Planning (Q23-Q26)**:\n  - **Applicable Actions**: Preconditions must hold in the current state.\n  - **Relevant Actions**: Effects must match the goal.\n  - **Mutex**: Actions/propositions that cannot coexist.\n- **For Rule-Based Systems (Q20-Q22)**:\n  - Build the conflict set by matching WMEs to rule preconditions.\n  - Apply conflict resolution (specificity/recency) to select the firing rule.\n\n### **Common Pitfalls**\n- **Heuristic Admissibility**: Ensure \\( h(n) \\leq h^*(n) \\). Manhattan distance is admissible for grid paths.\n- **TSP BnB**: Forgetting to refine nodes in order of increasing cost.\n- **Game Trees**: Misapplying MIN/MAX levels (MAX at root, alternates with depth).\n- **CSP**: Confusing arc consistency (pairwise) with path consistency (triplet).\n- **Planning**: Mixing up preconditions/effects of operators.",
