        "summary": "Here\u2019s a structured **summary of core topics, concepts, principles, and equations** for the exam **\"AI: Search Methods for Problem Solving\"**, along with **Mermaid knowledge graphs** to visualize relationships.\n\n---\n\n## **1. Search Algorithms**\n### **Core Concepts**\n- **State Space Representation**:\n  - Nodes (states), edges (actions), start/goal states, path cost.\n  - **Uniform Grid**: Each tile is 1\u00d71; Manhattan Distance (`|x\u2081 - x\u2082| + |y\u2081 - y\u2082|`) is the heuristic.\n- **Tie-Breaker**: If costs are equal, use **alphabetical order** of node labels.\n\n### **Algorithms**\n| Algorithm          | Description                                                                                     | Key Equation/Property                                                                 |\n|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Best-First Search** | Expands the most promising node first (using heuristic `h(n)`). Not guaranteed to be optimal. | `f(n) = h(n)` (heuristic only)                                                       |\n| **A***             | Combines cost-so-far (`g(n)`) and heuristic (`h(n)`). Optimal if heuristic is **admissible**. | `f(n) = g(n) + h(n)`                                                                  |\n| **Branch-and-Bound** | Explores branches systematically, prunes suboptimal paths. Avoids cycles.                     | Prunes if `cost > current best solution`.                                             |\n| **AO***            | And-Or graph search. Solves **decomposable problems** (e.g., problem reduction).               | `h*(n) = max/min` over successors (AND/OR nodes).                                     |\n\n### **Heuristics**\n- **Admissible Heuristic**: Never overestimates the true cost (`h(n) \u2264 h*(n)`).\n  - **Manhattan Distance** is admissible for grid-based pathfinding.\n- **Inadmissible Heuristic**: May overestimate (e.g., Euclidean distance in some grids).\n\n### **Key Observations from Questions**\n- **Best-First Search** may not find the shortest path (Q3: `S,D,A,G` vs. optimal `S,F,E,C,G`).\n- **A*** is optimal if the heuristic is admissible (Q4: `S,F,A,G`).\n- **Branch-and-Bound** guarantees optimality (Q6: Correct answer is **C**).\n- **Heuristic Admissibility**: Manhattan Distance is **inadmissible** in Q7 (due to edge weights not aligning with grid movement).\n\n---\n\n## **2. Game Trees (Minimax & Alpha-Beta Pruning)**\n### **Core Concepts**\n- **MAX/MIN Players**: MAX maximizes score; MIN minimizes.\n- **Leaf Nodes**: Terminal states with evaluation values.\n- **Optimal Strategy**: Path from root to leaf with best guaranteed outcome.\n- **SSS*** (Simplified Memory-Bounded A*): Combines A* and game-tree search.\n\n### **Key Equations**\n- **Minimax Value**:\n  - `V(node) = max(min(V(child)))` (for MAX nodes).\n  - `V(node) = min(max(V(child)))` (for MIN nodes).\n- **Alpha-Beta Pruning**: Eliminates branches that cannot influence the final decision.\n\n### **Key Observations from Questions**\n- **MAX\u2019s Best Strategy** (Q12): Choose paths where MIN cannot force a worse outcome (e.g., `A,D` and `F,G,H`).\n- **Leaf Nodes in Optimal Path** (Q13): `B,E` (highest MIN values under MAX\u2019s control).\n- **Irrelevant Nodes** (Q14): Nodes that don\u2019t affect the minimax value (e.g., `D,E,G,H`).\n- **SSS*** Solved Nodes** (Q15): `A,B,C,F` (solved first due to tie-breakers).\n\n---\n\n## **3. Automated Planning (Blocks World)**\n### **Core Concepts**\n- **Predicates**: `armEmpty`, `holding(X)`, `on(X,Y)`, `clear(X)`, `onTable(X)`.\n- **Operators**:\n  - `Pickup(X)`, `Putdown(X)`, `Stack(X,Y)`, `Unstack(X,Y)`.\n- **Preconditions & Effects**:\n  - **Pickup(X)**: Requires `armEmpty \u2227 clear(X) \u2227 onTable(X)`.\n  - **Stack(X,Y)**: Requires `holding(X) \u2227 clear(Y)`.\n- **Mutex Actions**: Actions that cannot occur simultaneously (e.g., `Pickup(A)` and `Stack(B,C)` if `A` is needed).\n- **Mutex Propositions**: Conflicting states (e.g., `on(A,B)` and `on(A,C)`).\n\n### **Key Observations from Questions**\n- **Applicable Actions** (Q16): Actions whose preconditions are satisfied in the start state (e.g., `Putdown(A)`, `Stack(A,B)`, `Unstack(D,C)`).\n- **Relevant Actions** (Q17): Actions that contribute to the goal (e.g., `Stack(A,B)`, `Stack(B,C)`).\n- **Mutex Pairs** (Q18, Q19):\n  - **Actions**: `Pickup(A)` and `Stack(B,A)` (both need `armEmpty`).\n  - **Propositions**: `onTable(A)` and `holding(A)` (mutually exclusive).\n\n---\n\n## **4. Problem Decomposition (AND-OR Graphs & AO*)**\n### **Core Concepts**\n- **AND-OR Graphs**:\n  - **OR Nodes**: Choose **one** successor (like standard search).\n  - **AND Nodes**: **All** successors must be solved (problem reduction).\n- **AO*** Algorithm:\n  - Uses **heuristic evaluation** (`h(n)`) to guide search.\n  - Updates node costs dynamically.\n- **Primitive Nodes**: Terminal nodes with **actual costs** (not expanded).\n\n### **Key Equations**\n- **AND Node Cost**: `h(n) = \u03a3 h(child)` (all children must be solved).\n- **OR Node Cost**: `h(n) = min(h(child))` (choose the best child).\n\n### **Key Observations from Questions**\n- **Node Expansion Order** (Q20): `S,C,A` (highest heuristic first).\n- **Dynamic Cost Updates** (Q21): `16,22,24` (costs increase as more nodes are expanded).\n- **Final Cost** (Q22): `32` (sum of primitive node costs + edge costs).\n\n---\n\n## **5. Rule-Based Expert Systems (Rete Algorithm)**\n### **Core Concepts**\n- **Rete Network**:\n  - **Alpha Nodes**: Filter working memory elements (WMEs).\n  - **Beta Nodes**: Join conditions (e.g., `pno = <x>`).\n  - **Conflict Set**: Rules whose conditions are satisfied.\n- **Conflict Resolution Strategies**:\n  - **Specificity**: Prefer more specific rules (more conditions).\n  - **Recency**: Prefer rules matching newer WMEs.\n\n### **Key Observations from Questions**\n- **Conflict Set** (Q23): Rules `R1, R2, R3, R4` triggered by WMEs.\n- **Specificity** (Q24): `R3` (most conditions: `class = MIG \u2227 bus-stop = YES`).\n- **Recency** (Q25): `R3` (matches the most recent WME `103`).\n\n---\n\n## **6. Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP)**\n### **Core Concepts**\n- **Variables**: Edges/junctions in line drawings.\n- **Domains**: Labels (`convex`, `concave`, `arrow`).\n- **Constraints**: Junction types (L, W, Y, T) enforce label consistency.\n- **Backtracking Search**: Assigns labels and checks consistency.\n\n### **Key Observations from Questions**\n- **Consistent Labeling** (Q26): `L2,Y1,L3,W3` (matches trihedral object constraints).\n- **Inconsistent Drawing** (Q27): `NIL` (no valid label assignment possible).\n\n---\n\n## **Mermaid Knowledge Graphs**\n### **1.
