        "summary": "Here\u2019s a structured **summary of core topics, concepts, principles, and equations** for the exam **\"AI: Search Methods for Problem Solving\"**, along with **Mermaid knowledge graphs** to visualize relationships.\n\n---\n\n## **1. Core Topics & Concepts**\n### **A. Search Algorithms**\n#### **1. Best-First Search (BFS)**\n   - **Concept**: Explores nodes based on a heuristic (e.g., Manhattan Distance).\n   - **Tie-breaker**: Alphabetical order if costs are equal.\n   - **Example**: Path `S,D,A,G` (Q3).\n   - **Equation**:\n     - **Heuristic (Manhattan Distance)**:\n       \\( h(n) = |x_n - x_{goal}| + |y_n - y_{goal}| \\)\n     - **Cost Function**:\n       \\( f(n) = h(n) \\) (ignores path cost).\n\n#### **2. A* Search**\n   - **Concept**: Combines path cost (`g(n)`) and heuristic (`h(n)`).\n   - **Optimality**: Guaranteed if heuristic is **admissible** (never overestimates).\n   - **Example**: Path `S,F,A,G` (Q4).\n   - **Equation**:\n     \\( f(n) = g(n) + h(n) \\)\n     - \\( g(n) \\): Path cost from start to `n`.\n     - \\( h(n) \\): Heuristic (e.g., Manhattan Distance).\n\n#### **3. Branch-and-Bound (BnB)**\n   - **Concept**: Prunes branches with costs worse than the best-known solution.\n   - **Variation**: Avoids cycles (e.g., `S,F,S,F,...`).\n   - **Example**: Path `S,F,E,C,G` (Q5).\n   - **Key Idea**:\n     - **Lower Bound**: Minimum possible cost for a subtree.\n     - **Pruning**: Discard subtrees where `LB > current best solution`.\n\n#### **4. Admissibility of Heuristics**\n   - **Admissible**: Never overestimates the true cost (e.g., Manhattan Distance).\n   - **Inadmissible**: Overestimates (e.g., if heuristic > actual cost).\n   - **Example**: Q7 (heuristic is **inadmissible**).\n\n---\n### **B. Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) with Branch-and-Bound**\n#### **1. Search Tree Structure**\n   - **Nodes**: Represent partial tours (e.g., `BC`, `\u00acBC`).\n   - **Costs**: Lower bounds for subtrees.\n   - **Example** (Q8-Q11):\n     - **Optimal Tour**: Node `d1` with cost `162` (Q9).\n     - **Order of Refinement**: `b1, c2, d1` (Q8).\n     - **Number of Cities**: 5 (Q10).\n     - **Optimal Path**: `A,D,B,C,E` (Q11).\n\n#### **2. Key Equations**\n   - **Lower Bound Calculation**:\n     - For a partial tour, sum:\n       - Cost of included edges.\n       - Minimum possible cost for excluded edges (e.g., using MST).\n   - **Pruning Rule**:\n     - If `LB(node) \u2265 cost(best_solution)`, prune the node.\n\n---\n### **C. Game Trees & Adversarial Search**\n#### **1. Minimax Algorithm**\n   - **Concept**: MAX player maximizes score; MIN player minimizes.\n   - **Evaluation**: Leaf nodes have static values (e.g., `A=60`, `B=66`).\n   - **Example** (Q12-Q15):\n     - **MAX Strategy**: Choose `B,E` (highest MIN choices) (Q13).\n     - **Irrelevant Nodes**: `D,E,G,H` (do not affect optimal play) (Q14).\n     - **SSS* Solved Nodes**: `A,B,C,F` (Q15).\n\n#### **2. Key Concepts**\n   - **Alpha-Beta Pruning**: Reduces search space by pruning branches.\n   - **Perfect Play**: Both players play optimally.\n\n---\n### **D. Automated Planning (Blocks World)**\n#### **1. Planning Graph**\n   - **Layers**:\n     - **Action Layer**: Possible actions (e.g., `Stack(A,B)`).\n     - **Proposition Layer**: States (e.g., `on(A,B)`, `clear(A)`).\n   - **Mutex (Mutual Exclusion)**:\n     - **Actions**: Conflicting actions (e.g., `Putdown(A)` and `Stack(A,B)`) (Q18).\n     - **Propositions**: Incompatible states (e.g., `onTable(A)` and `on(A,D)`) (Q19).\n\n#### **2. Relevant/Applicable Actions**\n   - **Applicable**: Preconditions satisfied in current state (Q16).\n   - **Relevant**: Actions that contribute to the goal (Q17).\n\n---\n### **E. AND-OR Graphs & AO* Algorithm**\n#### **1. Problem Decomposition**\n   - **AND Nodes**: All children must be solved (e.g., `S \u2192 A \u2227 B`).\n   - **OR Nodes**: Any child can be solved (e.g., `A \u2192 C | D`).\n   - **Example** (Q20-Q22):\n     - **Expansion Order**: `S,C,A` (Q20).\n     - **Node Values After Expansion**:\n       - 1st: `16` (S expanded).\n       - 2nd: `22` (C expanded).\n       - 3rd: `24` (A expanded) (Q21).\n     - **Final Cost**: `32` (Q22).\n\n#### **2. Key Equations**\n   - **Cost of AND Node**:\n     \\( h(n) = \\sum_{child \\in children} h(child) + \\text{edge costs} \\)\n   - **Cost of OR Node**:\n     \\( h(n) = \\min_{child \\in children} h(child) + \\text{edge cost} \\)\n\n---\n### **F. Rule-Based Expert Systems (Rete Algorithm)**\n#### **1. Conflict Set**\n   - **Rules**: Conditions \u2192 Actions (e.g., `IF CLASS=Amenity AND parking=YES THEN R1`).\n   - **Conflict Resolution Strategies**:\n     - **Specificity**: More specific rules fire first (Q24).\n     - **Recency**: Newest rules fire first (Q25).\n   - **Example** (Q23-Q25):\n     - **Conflict Set**: `R3, R4` (Q23).\n\n#### **2. Rete Network**\n   - **Alpha Nodes**: Filter working memory elements (WMEs).\n   - **Beta Nodes**: Join conditions.\n\n---\n### **G. Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP)**\n#### **1. Junction Labeling (Trihedral Objects)**\n   - **Junction Types**: L, W, Y, T (with labels `L1`, `W2`, etc.).\n   - **Consistency**: All edges/junctions must have valid labels.\n   - **Example** (Q26-Q27):\n     - **Consistent Assignment**: `L2,Y1,L3,W3` (Q26).\n     - **Inconsistent Drawing**: `NIL` (Q27).\n\n#### **2. Algorithms**\n   - **Backtracking**: Assign variables and check constraints.\n   - **Arc Consistency**: Propagate constraints to reduce domain.\n\n---\n\n## **2.

Exam Tips**\n1. **Heuristics**: Always check if the heuristic is **admissible** (A* optimality depends on this).\n2. **Tie-Breakers**: Use **alphabetical order** for search algorithms and **node labels** for AO*.\n3. **TSP**: Understand how **lower bounds** are calculated and how **pruning** works.\n4. **Game Trees**: MAX picks the **maximum** of MIN\u2019s choices (and vice versa).\n5. **Planning**: **Mutex** pairs are critical in planning graphs.\n6. **Rete Algorithm**: Focus on **conflict resolution strategies** (specificity vs. recency).\n7. **CSP**: Ensure **all constraints** are satisfied for a valid solution.",
