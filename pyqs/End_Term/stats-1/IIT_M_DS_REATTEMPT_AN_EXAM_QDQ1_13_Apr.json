Core Topics & Concepts**\n#### **A. Descriptive Statistics**\n1. **Population vs. Sample**\n   - **Population**: Entire group of interest (e.g., all threaded rods ever produced).\n   - **Sample**: Subset of the population (e.g., 40 randomly selected rods).\n   - *Key Idea*: Generalize sample statistics to infer population parameters.\n\n2. **Scales of Measurement**\n   - **Nominal**: Categories (e.g., eye color, t-shirt sizes).\n   - **Ordinal**: Ordered categories (e.g., survey ratings).\n   - **Interval**: Ordered with equal intervals (e.g., temperature in \u00b0C).\n   - **Ratio**: Interval + true zero (e.g., price, weight).\n   - *Example*: Bitcoin price (time-series, ratio scale); number of students (discrete, ratio).\n\n3. **Frequency Distributions**\n   - **Absolute Frequency**: Count of observations per category.\n   - **Relative Frequency**: Proportion of observations per category (`Relative Frequency = Frequency / Total`).\n   - *Key Property*: Identical relative frequency distributions imply identical **proportions**, not necessarily identical **counts**.\n\n4. **Measures of Central Tendency**\n   - **Mean**: Average (`\u03bc = \u03a3x_i / n`).\n   - **Median**: Middle value (50th percentile).\n   - **Mode**: Most frequent value.\n   - *Example*: Mode of t-shirt sizes is \u2018M\u2019 (highest frequency).\n\n5. **Measures of Dispersion**\n   - **Range**: `Max - Min`.\n   - **Interquartile Range (IQR)**: `Q3 - Q1` (middle 50% spread).\n     - *Calculation*: Sort data \u2192 Find Q1 (25th percentile) and Q3 (75th percentile).\n     - *Example*: For data `14, 18, 20, 23, 40`, IQR = `23 - 18 = 5`.\n   - **Variance**: Average squared deviation from the mean.\n     - Population: `\u03c3\u00b2 = \u03a3(x_i - \u03bc)\u00b2 / N`\n     - Sample: `s\u00b2 = \u03a3(x_i - x\u0304)\u00b2 / (n-1)`\n   - **Standard Deviation**: Square root of variance.\n\n6. **Box Plots & Percentiles**\n   - **Q1 (25th percentile)**: Price below which 25% of data falls.\n   - **Q3 (75th percentile)**: Separates highest 25% from lower 75%.\n   - *Example*: For t-shirt prices, Q1 = 200 Rs, Q3 = 550 Rs.\n\n---\n\n#### **B. Data Transformation**\n- **Linear Transformation**: If `Y = aX + b`, then:\n  - New Mean: `\u03bc_Y = a\u03bc_X + b`\n  - New Variance: `\u03c3\u00b2_Y = a\u00b2\u03c3\u00b2_X` (variance scales by `a\u00b2`).\n  - *Example*: If marks are transformed as `(X - 5) * 2`, new mean = `2*(40 - 5) = 70`.\n\n---\n\n#### **C. Correlation & Association**\n1. **Pearson\u2019s Correlation Coefficient (r)**\n   - Measures linear relationship between two continuous variables (`-1 \u2264 r \u2264 1`).\n   - Formula:\n     ```\n     r = [n(\u03a3xy) - (\u03a3x)(\u03a3y)] / sqrt([n\u03a3x\u00b2 - (\u03a3x)\u00b2][n\u03a3y\u00b2 - (\u03a3y)\u00b2])\n     ```\n   - *Example*: Correlation between sunshine hours and ice-cream sales (~0.82).\n\n2. **Association in Categorical Data**\n   - **Contingency Tables**: Cross-tabulation of categories (e.g., age group vs. willingness to buy).\n   - *Test*: Chi-square test for independence (not covered here, but implied in Q7).\n   - *Example*: Age group is associated with willingness to buy (Q7D).\n\n---\n\n#### **D. Time-Series Data**\n- **Definition**: Observations recorded at regular intervals (e.g., Bitcoin price hourly).\n- *Key Feature*: Temporal ordering matters.\n\n---\n\n#### **E. Moving Averages**\n- **Simple Moving Average (SMA)**:\n  - `m_k = (x_k + x_{k+1} + ... + x_{k+n-1}) / n`\n  - *Relationship between consecutive averages*:\n    ```\n    m_{k+1} = m_k + (x_{k+n} - x_k) / n\n    ```\n  - *Example*: Given `m1, m2, m3` (Q6), `m2 = m1 + (x_{n+1} - x_1)/n`.\n\n---\n\n### **2.

Exam Tips**\n1. **Identify Scale of Measurement**: Critical for choosing the right analysis (e.g., nominal vs. ratio).\n2. **Moving Averages**: Memorize the recursive update formula (`m_{k+1} = m_k + (x_{k+n} - x_k)/n`).\n3. **Transformation Rules**: Mean/variance changes under linear transformations.\n4. **Association vs. Causation**: Contingency tables show association (Q7D), not causation.\n5. **IQR Calculation**: Always sort data first (Q8, Q14).\n6. **Pearson\u2019s r**: Use the formula systematically (Q11). Calculate sums first!",
