        "summary": "Here\u2019s a structured **summary of core topics, concepts, principles, and equations** for the exam, followed by **Mermaid knowledge graphs** to visualize relationships.\n\n---\n\n## **Core Topics & Concepts Summary**\n### **1. Software Architecture & Design Patterns**\n#### **MVC (Model-View-Controller) Architecture**\n- **Model (A)**: Manages data, logic, and rules (e.g., stores tasks and completion status).\n- **View (B)**: Displays data to the user (e.g., shows completed/pending tasks).\n- **Controller (C)**: Handles user input, updates the model, and refreshes the view (e.g., adds/deletes tasks).\n- **Key Principle**: Separation of concerns (data, UI, and logic are decoupled).\n\n#### **Client-Server vs. Peer-to-Peer Architecture**\n- **Client-Server**:\n  - Clients and servers **can** reside on the same machine (e.g., localhost).\n  - Not strictly required to be on separate machines.\n- **Peer-to-Peer (P2P)**:\n  - Fault tolerance depends on network design (not inherently more fault-tolerant).\n  - No central server; peers act as both clients and servers.\n\n---\n### **2. Databases**\n#### **Relational Databases**\n- **Column**: Stores a **single attribute/field** (e.g., `name`, `age`).\n- **Row**: Stores a **single record/entry** (e.g., one user\u2019s data).\n- **SQLite & Flask-SQLAlchemy**:\n  - Primary Key (`PK`): Uniquely identifies a row (e.g., `employee_id`).\n  - Foreign Key (`FK`): Links tables (e.g., `slip_id` in `Salary_Slip` references `employee_id` in `Employee`).\n  - **Entity-Relationship (ER) Diagrams**:\n    - One-to-many: An employee can have **zero or more** salary slips.\n    - A salary slip **must** belong to one employee (mandatory relationship).\n\n#### **SQL vs. Flask-SQLAlchemy Models**\n- Example: SQL `UNIQUE` constraint \u2192 Flask-SQLAlchemy `unique=True`.\n- Example: SQL `PRIMARY KEY` \u2192 Flask-SQLAlchemy `primary_key=True`.\n\n---\n### **3. Web Development**\n#### **Flask Framework**\n- **Routing**: Maps URLs to functions (e.g., `@app.route('/home')`).\n- **Request Handling**:\n  - `request.args`: Access query parameters (e.g., `?name=John`).\n  - `request.method`: Check if `GET`, `POST`, etc.\n- **Jinja2 Templating**:\n  - Loops: `{% for item in list %} ... {% endfor %}`.\n  - Conditionals: `{% if condition %} ... {% endif %}`.\n  - Filters: `{{ variable|upper }}`, `{{ list|length }}`.\n  - Grouping: `{% for group in list|groupby('attribute') %}`.\n- **Error Handling**:\n  - `@app.errorhandler(404)`: Customize 404 pages.\n  - `abort(404)`: Trigger a 404 error.\n- **Flask-RESTful**:\n  - Define resources with `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE` methods.\n  - Use `marshal_with` to format JSON responses.\n\n#### **HTML/CSS**\n- **Display Properties**:\n  - `inline-block`: Elements flow inline but respect width/height (e.g., `<h4>` and `<span>` with fixed widths).\n- **Web Components**: Custom HTML elements (e.g., `<my-element>`) using JavaScript classes.\n\n---\n### **4. Version Control (Git)**\n- **Staging Area**: Temporary space for changes before commit.\n- **Commands**:\n  - `git rm --cached <file>`: Remove from staging **but keep the file locally**.\n  - `git rm <file>`: Delete the file **and** remove from staging.\n\n---\n### **5. Networking**\n#### **Bandwidth & Data Consumption**\n- **Total Data (GB)** = \u222b (Bandwidth (Mbps) \u00d7 Time (hours)) / (8 \u00d7 1024) over all intervals.\n  - Example: For 8 hours at 8 Mbps \u2192 `(8 * 8 * 3600) / (8 * 1024) = 2.8125 GB`.\n  - **Total for 24 hours**: Sum data for all intervals (e.g., 6.52 GB in Q7).\n\n#### **Latency & Throughput**\n- **Round-Trip Time (RTT)**: `2 \u00d7 Distance / Speed of Light`.\n- **Requests per Second (N)**:\n  - Doubling `N` requires:\n    - Halving RTT (e.g., double speed `2v` or halve distance `D/2`).\n    - **Not** increasing distance or reducing speed.\n\n---\n### **6. Testing**\n#### **Types of Testing**\n| Type               | Description                                                                 |\n|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Unit Testing**   | Tests individual functions (e.g., `pytest`).                              |\n| **Regression**     | Ensures new changes don\u2019t break existing functionality.                     |\n| **User Acceptance**| Validates software with end-users (e.g., beta testing).                     |\n| **System**         | Tests the entire system (one step beyond integration testing).             |\n| **Automation**     | Scripts browser interactions (e.g., Selenium).                             |\n\n#### **Test Coverage**\n| Type               | Description                                  | Example                          |\n|--------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| **Function**       | Every function is called at least once.     | `foo()` is invoked.               |\n| **Statement**      | Every line of code is executed.             | All statements in `foo()` run.   |\n| **Branch**         | Every `if/else` path is tested.             | `foo(1,1)` and `foo(1,0)`.       |\n| **Condition**      | Every sub-condition is tested (e.g., `x>0 AND y>0`). | `foo(0,1)` and `foo(1,0)`. |\n\n#### **Pytest**\n- **Command**: `pytest file.py -k \"test_class\"` runs tests in `test_class`.\n- **Assertions**: Check if functions return expected outputs (e.g., `assert func(1, 2) == 5`).\n- **Output**: Shows passed/failed tests (e.g., `1 failed, 2 passed`).\n\n---\n### **7. Mathematics (Number Bases)**\n- **Base Conversion**:\n  - Decimal equivalent of `113_a` = `1\u00d7a\u00b2 + 1\u00d7a\u00b9 + 3\u00d7a\u2070`.\n  - Compare with `365_b` = `3\u00d7b\u00b2 + 6\u00d7b\u00b9 + 5\u00d7b\u2070`.\n- **Example**: For `a=16`, `b=8`:\n  - `113_16` = `1\u00d7256 + 1\u00d716 + 3\u00d71 = 275`.\n  - `365_8` = `3\u00d764 + 6\u00d78 + 5\u00d71 = 245`.\n  - Since `275 > 245`, the condition holds.\n\n---\n### **8. Cloud Computing**\n#### **Cold Storage (e.g., Amazon Glacier)**\n- **Characteristics**:\n  - Low cost, high durability.\n  - High latency for retrieval (hours to days).\n\n---\n### **9. Algorithms & Complexity**\n#### **Selection Sort Variants**\n- **Time Complexity**: `O(N\u00b2)` for the algorithm described in Q33 (finding min `N` times).\n\n---\n### **10. Logging & Debugging**\n- **Python Logging**:\n  - Levels: `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, `CRITICAL`.\n  - `logging.basicConfig(level=logging.WARNING)`: Only logs `WARNING` and above.\n  - `logging.exception()`: Logs stack traces for exceptions.\n\n---\n### **11. Decorators**\n- **Syntax**:\n  ```python\n  @decorator\n  def func(): ...\n  ```\n- **Example**: A decorator that multiplies the output by the input:\n  ```python\n  def decor(func):\n      def wrapper(x):\n          y = func(x)  # Returns (x, \"hello\")\n          return x * y[0]  # 5 * 5 = 25 (but Q31 returns a tuple, so output is (5, 'hello') repeated).\n      return wrapper\n  ```\n\n---\n## **Mermaid Knowledge Graphs**\n### **1.
