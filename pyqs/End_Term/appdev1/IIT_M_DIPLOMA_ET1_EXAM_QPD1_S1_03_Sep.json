        "summary": "Here\u2019s a structured summary of the core topics, concepts, and equations from the exam, followed by Mermaid knowledge graphs to visualize relationships.\n\n---\n\n### **Core Topics and Concepts Summary**\n\n#### **1. Software Architecture and Design Patterns**\n- **MVC (Model-View-Controller) Architecture**:\n  - **Model**: Manages data, logic, and rules (e.g., stores tasks in a to-do app).\n  - **View**: Displays data to the user (e.g., UI for pending/completed tasks).\n  - **Controller**: Handles user input and updates the model/view (e.g., adds/deletes tasks).\n  - *Example*: Question 2 (Todo list app components).\n\n- **Client-Server vs. Peer-to-Peer Architecture**:\n  - **Client-Server**: Clients request services; servers provide them. Clients/servers can be on the same or separate machines.\n  - **Peer-to-Peer**: All nodes are equal (no dedicated server). Fault tolerance depends on network design.\n  - *Key Point*: Neither statement in Question 3 is universally correct.\n\n- **Custom HTML Elements**:\n  - **Web Components**: Allow creation of reusable custom HTML elements (e.g., `<my-element>`).\n  - *Example*: Question 5.\n\n---\n\n#### **2. Databases**\n- **Relational Databases**:\n  - **Column**: Stores a single attribute (e.g., `field` like \"name\").\n  - **Row**: Stores a record (e.g., `single entry` like one user\u2019s data).\n  - *Example*: Question 4.\n\n- **SQL and Flask-SQLAlchemy**:\n  - **Primary Key (PK)**: Uniquely identifies a row (e.g., `car_id` in Question 22).\n  - **Unique Constraint**: Ensures no duplicate values in a column (e.g., `model`, `name` in `car` table).\n  - **Foreign Key (FK)**: Links tables (e.g., `Employee_id` in `Salary_Slip` references `Employee` table).\n  - *Example*: Questions 22, 23.\n\n- **Entity-Relationship (ER) Diagrams**:\n  - **One-to-Many**: One employee can have many salary slips (but not vice versa).\n  - *Inference*: An employee can exist without salary slips (Question 23).\n\n---\n\n#### **3. Version Control (Git)**\n- **Git Commands**:\n  - `git rm --cached <filename>`: Removes a file from staging but keeps it in the working directory.\n  - *Example*: Question 6.\n\n---\n\n#### **4. Web Development**\n- **Flask**:\n  - **Routing**: Maps URLs to functions (e.g., `@app.route('/home/<path:directory>')`).\n  - **Templates (Jinja2)**:\n    - `{% for %}` loops, `{{ variable }}` placeholders.\n    - Macros for reusable HTML snippets (e.g., `unordered_list` in Question 14).\n  - **Request Handling**:\n    - `request.args`: Access query parameters (e.g., `?name=value`).\n    - `request.method`: Check HTTP method (GET/POST).\n  - *Examples*: Questions 9, 12, 14, 21, 26, 28, 32.\n\n- **HTML/CSS**:\n  - `display: inline-block`: Elements flow inline but respect width/height (e.g., Question 12).\n  - **Web Components**: Custom elements (e.g., `<my-element>`).\n\n- **RESTful APIs**:\n  - **Flask-RESTful**:\n    - `Resource` classes define endpoints (e.g., `TodoSimple` in Question 11).\n    - `@marshal_with`: Serializes output to JSON.\n    - *Example*: Questions 11, 27.\n\n---\n\n#### **5. Testing**\n- **Types of Testing**:\n  - **Regression Testing**: Ensures new changes don\u2019t break existing functionality.\n  - **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**: Validates software with end-users (e.g., beta testing).\n  - **System Testing**: Tests the complete system (one step beyond integration).\n  - **Test Automation**: Simulates user interactions (e.g., Selenium).\n  - *Example*: Question 19.\n\n- **Test Coverage**:\n  - **Function Coverage**: Every function is called at least once.\n  - **Statement Coverage**: Every statement is executed.\n  - **Branch Coverage**: Every decision branch (e.g., `if-else`) is tested.\n  - **Condition Coverage**: Every sub-condition in a decision is tested.\n  - *Example*: Question 18.\n\n- **Pytest**:\n  - `assert`: Validates conditions.\n  - `-k`: Filters tests by name (e.g., `pytest -k Test_class0`).\n  - *Example*: Questions 16, 30.\n\n---\n\n#### **6. Mathematics for Computing**\n- **Base Conversion**:\n  - Convert numbers from base `a` or `b` to decimal:\n    - \\( N1 = 113_a = 1 \\cdot a^2 + 1 \\cdot a^1 + 3 \\cdot a^0 \\).\n    - \\( N2 = 365_b = 3 \\cdot b^2 + 6 \\cdot b^1 + 5 \\cdot b^0 \\).\n  - *Example*: Question 13 (find \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) such that \\( N1 > N2 \\)).\n\n- **Network Latency**:\n  - Latency \\( L = \\frac{2D}{v} \\) (round-trip time for client-server communication).\n  - To double requests/second (\\( N \\)):\n    - Double speed (\\( v \\rightarrow 2v \\)) or halve distance (\\( D \\rightarrow D/2 \\)).\n  - *Example*: Question 8.\n\n- **Data Consumption Calculation**:\n  - Total data = \\(\\sum (\\text{bandwidth} \\times \\text{time})\\).\n  - Convert Mbps to GB: \\( 1 \\text{ Mbps} = \\frac{1}{8} \\text{ MB/s} \\).\n  - *Example*: Question 7 (bandwidth varies over 24 hours).\n\n---\n\n#### **7. Cloud Computing**\n- **Cold Storage (e.g., Amazon Glacier)**:\n  - **Low Cost**: Cheaper than hot storage.\n  - **High Durability**: Data is rarely lost.\n  - **High Latency**: Retrieval takes hours/days.\n  - *Example*: Question 25.\n\n---\n\n#### **8. Algorithms**\n- **Sorting Algorithm Time Complexity**:\n  - **Selection Sort Variants**:\n    - Find min element, append to new array, repeat: \\( O(N^2) \\).\n  - *Example*: Question 33.\n\n---\n\n#### **9. Python Specifics**\n- **Decorators**:\n  - Modify function behavior (e.g., `@decor` in Question 31).\n- **Command-Line Arguments**:\n  - `sys.argv`: Access script arguments (e.g., `sys.argv[1]`).\n  - *Example*: Questions 15, 17.\n- **Logging**:\n  - `logging.basicConfig`: Configure log level (e.g., `WARNING`).\n  - *Example*: Question 17.\n\n---\n\n#### **10. Miscellaneous**\n- **Alexa Device Views**:\n  - **View**: AI voice + LED lights (user-facing components).\n  - *Example*: Question 24.\n- **Jinja2 Grouping**:\n  - `groupby`: Group lists by attributes (e.g., `Gender` in Question 29).\n\n---\n\n### **Mermaid Knowledge Graphs**\n\n#### **1.
