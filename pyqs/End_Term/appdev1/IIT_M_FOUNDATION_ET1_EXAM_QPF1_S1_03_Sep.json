        "summary": "Here\u2019s a structured summary of the **core topics, concepts, principles, and equations** essential for the **\"Modern Application Development 1\"** exam, along with **Mermaid knowledge graphs** to visualize relationships.\n\n---\n\n## **1. Core Topics & Concepts**\n### **A. Software Architecture & Design Patterns**\n#### **1. MVC (Model-View-Controller) Architecture**\n- **Model**: Manages data, logic, and rules (e.g., stores tasks in a to-do app).\n- **View**: Displays data to the user (e.g., UI showing pending/completed tasks).\n- **Controller**: Handles user input, updates the model, and refreshes the view.\n- **Example**:\n  - **Model (A)**: Stores task list and completion status.\n  - **View (B)**: Displays tasks (completed/pending) and accepts new tasks.\n  - **Controller (C)**: Adds/deletes tasks, marks tasks as completed.\n\n#### **2. Client-Server vs. Peer-to-Peer Architecture**\n- **Client-Server**:\n  - Clients request services; servers provide them.\n  - **Misconception**: Clients and servers **do not** need to be on separate machines.\n- **Peer-to-Peer (P2P)**:\n  - All nodes are equal (can act as client/server).\n  - **Fault Tolerance**: Not inherently more fault-tolerant (depends on implementation).\n\n#### **3. Web Components**\n- Custom HTML elements using JavaScript (e.g., `<my-element>`).\n- **Key APIs**:\n  - `CustomElementRegistry.define()`: Registers a new custom element.\n  - Shadow DOM: Encapsulates component styles/scripts.\n\n---\n\n### **B. Databases**\n#### **1. Relational Databases**\n- **Terminology**:\n  - **Column**: Stores a **single field** (e.g., `name`).\n  - **Row**: Stores a **single entry** (e.g., one user\u2019s data).\n- **Constraints**:\n  - `PRIMARY KEY`: Uniquely identifies a row.\n  - `UNIQUE`: Ensures no duplicate values in a column.\n  - `NOT NULL`: Column cannot have `NULL` values.\n\n#### **2. SQLAlchemy (Flask-SQLAlchemy)**\n- **Model Definition**:\n  ```python\n  class Employee(db.Model):\n      id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)\n      name = db.Column(db.String(50), unique=True, nullable=False)\n  ```\n- **Querying**:\n  ```python\n  employees = Employee.query.filter_by(gender=\"Male\").all()\n  ```\n\n#### **3. Entity-Relationship (ER) Diagrams**\n- **One-to-Many**:\n  - Example: One `Employee` can have many `Salary_Slip`s.\n  - **Inferences**:\n    - A salary slip **must** belong to one employee (foreign key constraint).\n    - An employee **can exist** without salary slips.\n\n---\n\n### **C. Version Control (Git)**\n#### **1. Key Commands**\n| Command                          | Description                                  |\n|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|\n| `git rm --cached <file>`         | Remove from staging but keep locally.        |\n| `git add <file>`                 | Stage a file for commit.                    |\n| `git commit -m \"message\"`        | Commit staged changes.                      |\n\n#### **2. Branching & Merging**\n- **Branches**: Isolate features/bugfixes.\n- **Merge Conflicts**: Resolve manually when Git cannot auto-merge.\n\n---\n\n### **D. Web Development (Flask & Jinja2)**\n#### **1. Flask Routing & Request Handling**\n- **Route Decorators**:\n  ```python\n  @app.route('/user/<username>')\n  def show_user(username):\n      return f\"Hello {username}!\"\n  ```\n- **HTTP Methods**:\n  - `GET`: Retrieve data.\n  - `POST`: Submit data.\n  - `PUT`: Update data.\n\n#### **2. Jinja2 Templating**\n- **Loops**:\n  ```jinja2\n  {% for item in items %}\n      <li>{{ item }}</li>\n  {% endfor %}\n  ```\n- **Conditionals**:\n  ```jinja2\n  {% if user %}\n      Welcome, {{ user }}!\n  {% endif %}\n  ```\n- **Macros**: Reusable template snippets.\n  ```jinja2\n  {% macro render_user(user) %}\n      <div>{{ user.name }}</div>\n  {% endmacro %}\n  ```\n\n#### **3. Flask-RESTful**\n- **Resource Classes**:\n  ```python\n  class Todo(Resource):\n      def get(self, todo_id):\n          return {\"task\": \"Buy groceries\"}\n  ```\n- **Marshalling**: Format API responses.\n  ```python\n  fields = {\"id\": fields.Integer, \"name\": fields.String}\n  @marshal_with(fields)\n  def get(self):\n      return user\n  ```\n\n---\n\n### **E. Testing & Debugging**\n#### **1. Unit Testing (Pytest)**\n- **Assertions**:\n  ```python\n  def test_add():\n      assert add(2, 3) == 5\n  ```\n- **Test Outputs**:\n  - `PASS`: Test succeeds.\n  - `FAIL`: Test assertion fails.\n  - `ERROR`: Test crashes.\n\n#### **2. Test Coverage Types**\n| Type               | Description                                  | Example                          |\n|--------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| **Function**       | Every function is called.                   | `foo()` is invoked.              |\n| **Statement**      | Every line of code is executed.             | All `if` branches are tested.    |\n| **Branch**         | Every `if/else` path is tested.             | `foo(1,1)` and `foo(1,0)`.      |\n| **Condition**      | Every boolean sub-expression is tested.     | `(x > 0) && (y > 0)`.           |\n\n#### **3. Logging**\n- **Levels**: `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, `CRITICAL`.\n- **Example**:\n  ```python\n  import logging\n  logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)\n  logging.info(\"User logged in\")\n  ```\n\n---\n\n### **F. Networking & Performance**\n#### **1. Bandwidth & Data Consumption**\n- **Formula**:\n  ```\n  Total Data (GB) = Bandwidth (Mbps) \u00d7 Time (hours) \u00d7 3600 (s) / (8 \u00d7 1024\u00b3) (GB)\n  ```\n- **Example**:\n  - 8 Mbps \u00d7 8 hours = **5.216 GB** (but answer was **6.52 GB** due to rounding).\n\n#### **2. Latency & Throughput**\n- **Round-Trip Time (RTT)**:\n  ```\n  RTT = 2 \u00d7 Distance / Speed of Light\n  ```\n- **Doubling Requests/Second (N)**:\n  - Halve RTT (e.g., double speed `v \u2192 2v` or halve distance `D \u2192 D/2`).\n\n---\n\n### **G. Mathematics for Computing**\n#### **1. Number Base Conversion**\n- **Decimal Equivalent**:\n  - \\(113_a = 1 \\times a^2 + 1 \\times a^1 + 3 \\times a^0\\)\n  - \\(365_b = 3 \\times b^2 + 6 \\times b^1 + 5 \\times b^0\\)\n- **Example**:\n  - For \\(a = 16\\), \\(b = 8\\):\n    - \\(113_{16} = 275_{10}\\)\n    - \\(365_8 = 245_{10}\\)\n    - \\(275 > 245\\) \u2192 Valid.\n\n#### **2. Time Complexity**\n- **Selection Sort-like Algorithm**:\n  - **Steps**:\n    1. Find min element in unsorted array.\n    2. Append to new array.\n    3. Repeat until unsorted array is empty.\n  - **Complexity**: \\(O(N^2)\\) (nested loops).\n\n---\n\n## **2. Key Equations**\n| Concept               | Equation                                                                 |\n|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Data Consumption**  | \\(\\text{Data (GB)} = \\frac{\\text{Bandwidth (Mbps)} \\times \\text{Time (s)}}{8 \\times 1024^3}\\) |\n| **Round-Trip Time**   | \\(\\text{RTT} = \\frac{2 \\times \\text{Distance}}{\\text{Speed of Light}}\\) |\n| **Base Conversion**   | \\(N_a = d_n \\times a^n + \\dots + d_0 \\times a^0\\)                       |\n| **Time Complexity**   | \\(O(N^2)\\) for nested loops (e.g., selection sort).                      |\n\n---\n\n## **3. Mermaid Knowledge Graphs**\n### **Graph 1: MVC Architecture**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[User] -->|Interacts with| B[View]\n    B -->|Renders| C[Model]\n    C -->|Updates| B\n    A -->|Sends Input| D[Controller]\n    D -->|Modifies| C\n    D -->|Refreshes| B\n```\n\n### **Graph 2: Git Workflow**\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n    A[Working Directory] -->|git add| B[Staging Area]\n    B -->|git commit| C[Local Repository]\n    C -->|git push| D[Remote Repository]\n    D -->|git pull| C\n```\n\n### **Graph 3: Flask Request Lifecycle**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Client] -->|HTTP Request| B[Flask App]\n    B -->|Route Matching| C[View Function]\n    C -->|Processes Request| D[Model/Database]\n    D -->|Returns Data| C\n    C -->|Renders Template| E[Jinja2]\n    E -->|HTML Response| A\n```\n\n### **Graph 4: Testing Pyramid**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Unit Tests] -->|Fast, Isolated| B[Integration Tests]\n    B -->|Component Interaction| C[End-to-End Tests]\n    C -->|Full System| D[Manual Testing]\n```\n\n### **Graph 5: Client-Server vs P2P**\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n    subgraph Client-Server\n        A[Client 1] -->|Request| B[Server]\n        C[Client 2] -->|Request| B\n        B -->|Response| A\n        B -->|Response| C\n    end\n    subgraph Peer-to-Peer\n        D[Peer 1] <--->|Share| E[Peer 2]\n        E <--->|Share| F[Peer 3]\n    end\n```\n\n### **Graph 6: SQLAlchemy Relationships**\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n    A[Employee] -->|One-to-Many| B[Salary_Slip]\n    B -->|Foreign Key| A\n```\n\n### **Graph 7: Jinja2 Template Inheritance**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[base.html] -->|extends| B[home.html]\n    A -->|defines blocks| C[content]\n    B -->|fills block| C\n```",
