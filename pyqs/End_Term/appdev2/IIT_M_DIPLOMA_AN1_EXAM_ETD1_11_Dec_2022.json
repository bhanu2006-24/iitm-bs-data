        "summary": "Here\u2019s a structured summary of the **core topics, concepts, principles, and equations** essential for the **\"Diploma Level: Modern Application Development 2\"** exam, along with **Mermaid knowledge graphs** to visualize relationships.\n\n---\n\n---\n\n## **Core Topics & Concepts Summary**\n### **1. Vue.js & Vuex**\n#### **Key Concepts:**\n- **Vue Component Lifecycle**: `created`, `mounted`, `updated`, `destroyed`.\n- **Vuex Store**: State management (`state`, `getters`, `mutations`, `actions`).\n  - **`mapState` Helper**: Maps Vuex state to computed properties in components.\n    - Syntax: `...mapState(['stateA', 'stateB'])` (spread operator required).\n- **Dynamic Class Binding**: `v-bind:class` with conditional logic.\n  - Example: `:class=\"{ 'active': isActive, 'error': hasError }\"`.\n- **Props & Events**: Parent-child communication via `props` and `$emit`.\n- **Vue Router**:\n  - Nested routes (`children` in route config).\n  - Dynamic route matching (`:param`).\n  - Query parameters (`?key=value`).\n  - `router-view` renders matched components.\n\n#### **Key Code Snippets:**\n```javascript\n// Vuex Store\nconst store = new Vuex.Store({\n  state: { count: 0 },\n  mutations: {\n    increment(state) { state.count++; }\n  }\n});\n\n// MapState in Component\ncomputed: {\n  ...mapState(['count'])  // Correct (Option A in Q2)\n}\n\n// Dynamic Class Binding\n<div :class=\"[isActive ? 'active' : '', 'static-class']\"></div>\n```\n\n---\n\n### **2. JavaScript (ES6+)**\n#### **Key Concepts:**\n- **Closures & `let` in Loops**:\n  - `let` creates block-scoped variables (unlike `var`).\n  - Example (Q7):\n    ```javascript\n    for (let i = 1; i < 7; i++) {\n      setTimeout(() => console.log(i), 2);  // Logs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\n    }\n    ```\n- **Promises & Async/Await**:\n  - `.then()`/`catch()` chaining.\n  - `Promise` states: `pending`, `fulfilled`, `rejected`.\n  - Example (Q10, Q12, Q15, Q18):\n    ```javascript\n    new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n      if (condition) resolve(\"Success\");\n      else reject(\"Error\");\n    })\n    .then(data => console.log(data))\n    .catch(err => console.error(err));\n    ```\n- **Arrow Functions & `this`**:\n  - Arrow functions inherit `this` from the surrounding scope.\n  - Example (Q14):\n    ```javascript\n    const obj = {\n      a: 10,\n      func: () => console.log(this.a)  // `this` refers to global/window\n    };\n    ```\n- **Prototypal Inheritance**:\n  - Example (Q11):\n    ```javascript\n    function Person(name) { this.name = name; }\n    Person.prototype.getName = function() { return this.name; };\n    ```\n\n#### **Key Outputs:**\n| Question | Output Explanation                                                                 |\n|----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Q7       | `1 2 3 4 5 6` (due to `let` block-scoping in `for` loop).                        |\n| Q10      | `[]` (async `console.log` executes before `result` is updated).                     |\n| Q12      | `Boiling Water ...` \u2192 `Making Tea` (Promise rejects, `.catch` logs).               |\n| Q15      | `Resolved [\"quiz1\"]` after **10 seconds** (interval runs 5 times: 2s \u00d7 5 = 10s). |\n| Q18      | `Checkpoint 3 5` \u2192 `Checkpoint 4` \u2192 `Checkpoint 6 undefined` \u2192 `Checkpoint 2 5`.   |\n\n---\n\n### **3. Web Technologies**\n#### **Key Concepts:**\n- **Caching**:\n  - **Private Cache**: Client-specific (e.g., browser cache).\n  - **Shared Cache**: Shared across users (e.g., CDN, proxy cache).\n  - **Latency**: Browser cache < proxy cache < origin server.\n  - **False Statement (Q4)**: Shared cache is **not** suitable for personalized responses.\n\n- **Storage Mechanisms**:\n  | Mechanism       | Persistence          | Sent with Requests | Use Case                          |\n  |-----------------|----------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------------|\n  | **Cookies**     | Expires (configurable)| Yes                | Session management, tracking.     |\n  | **Local Storage** | Persistent          | No                 | Client-side data (e.g., preferences). |\n  | **Session Storage** | Tab-specific      | No                 | Temporary session data.          |\n\n  - **Correct Answer (Q5)**: **Cookies** (sent with every request).\n\n- **Same-Origin Policy (SOP)**:\n  - Default allowance: **Same origin** (scheme + host + port).\n  - Example (Q6): `http://origin2.com` can fetch from itself, not `http://origin1.com`.\n\n- **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)**:\n  - Attack trick users into submitting malicious requests via authenticated sessions.\n  - Example (Q9): `<img src=\"http://example1.com/delete?id=1\">` triggers a DELETE request.\n\n- **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)**:\n  - Requires server-side headers (e.g., `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`).\n  - **False Statement (Q20)**: Flask does **not** enable CORS by default.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Backend & Scalability**\n#### **Key Concepts:**\n- **Asynchronous Job Processing**:\n  - **Order for Brute-Force Task (Q3)**:\n    1. Dispatch a backend job (e.g., to a queue like RabbitMQ).\n    2. Invoke a webhook on completion.\n    3. Relieve the worker.\n  - **Correct Order**: `III \u2192 I \u2192 II` (Option B).\n\n- **Scaling Strategies**:\n  | Term               | Description                                                                 |\n  |--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n  | **Scaling Out**    | Adding more servers (horizontal scaling).                                   |\n  | **Scaling Up**     | Upgrading existing server resources (vertical scaling).                     |\n  | **Diagonal Scaling** | Combining horizontal + vertical scaling.                                  |\n  | **Sharding**       | Splitting a database table horizontally (e.g., by user ID).                |\n\n  - **True Statements (Q24)**: B (horizontal scaling), C (horizontal partitioning).\n\n- **Message Brokers vs. Point-to-Point**:\n  | Feature               | Point-to-Point          | Message Broker (e.g., RabbitMQ)       |\n  |-----------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n  | **Connections**       | O(n\u00b2)                   | O(n) (central broker)                 |\n  | **Scalability**       | Poor                    | Better                                |\n  | **Complexity**        | High                    | Lower                                 |\n\n  - **False Statements (Q19)**: A (O(nlogn) is incorrect), B (O(logn) is incorrect).\n\n---\n\n### **5. Security**\n#### **Key Concepts:**\n- **Session Cookies**:\n  - Deleted on browser close (Q21: A).\n  - Sent to the origin server with every request (Q21: B).\n- **Flask Defaults**:\n  - Runs on **port 5000** (Q20: D).\n  - **CSRF protection** is **not** enabled by default (Q20: A).\n  - **Local Storage** is **not** synced across devices (Q20: B).\n\n---\n\n### **6. Algorithms & Data Structures**\n#### **Key Concepts:**\n- **Sorting in JavaScript**:\n  - `array.sort((a, b) => a - b)` for ascending.\n  - Example (Q30, Q31):\n    ```javascript\n    slots.sort((a, b) => a.date - b.date);  // Ascending by date\n    ```\n  - **Output (Q30)**: `17 19` (sorted dates).\n  - **Output (Q31)**: `1` (only booked slot ID).\n\n---\n\n---\n\n## **Mermaid Knowledge Graphs**\n### **1.
