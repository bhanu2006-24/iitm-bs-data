        "summary": "Here\u2019s a structured summary of the core topics, concepts, principles, and equations from the question paper, followed by Mermaid knowledge graphs.\n\n---\n\n### **Core Topics and Concepts**\n\n#### **1. Disk Stacking Problem (Questions 2-8)**\n- **Problem**: Maximize the height of a stack of cuboid disks where each disk above must have strictly smaller width, depth, and height than the disk below.\n- **Key Concepts**:\n  - **Dynamic Programming (DP)**: Use a DP table where `DP[i]` represents the maximum height achievable with disk `i` at the bottom.\n  - **Sorting**: Disks must be sorted by one of their dimensions (e.g., height) to ensure the DP table is filled correctly.\n  - **Constraints**: No rotation of disks is allowed.\n- **Equations**:\n  - Initialize: `DP[i] = height of disk i`.\n  - Transition: For each disk `i`, check all disks `j` where `j < i` and `disk_j` can be placed on top of `disk_i`. Update `DP[i] = max(DP[i], DP[j] + height of disk i)`.\n- **Complexity**: `O(N^2)` for the DP approach after sorting.\n\n#### **2. Dice Roll Permutations (Questions 9-19)**\n- **Problem**: Count the number of ways to achieve a target sum `T` using `N` dice, each with `S` sides.\n- **Key Concepts**:\n  - **Dynamic Programming**: Use a DP table `DP[N][T]` where `N` is the number of dice and `T` is the target sum.\n  - **Recurrence Relation**:\n    - `DP[N][T] = sum_{s=1 to S} DP[N-1][T-s]` (if `T-s >= 0`).\n  - **Base Cases**:\n    - `DP[0][0] = 1` (one way to achieve sum 0 with 0 dice).\n    - `DP[N][0] = 0` for `N > 0` (no way to achieve sum 0 with positive dice).\n    - `DP[0][T] = 0` for `T > 0` (no dice to achieve a positive sum).\n  - **Constraints**:\n    - If `T < N` or `T > N*S`, the answer is 0 (impossible to achieve).\n- **Complexity**: `O(N*S*T)` for the DP approach.\n\n#### **3. Graph 3-Coloring with Tree Decomposition (Questions 20-24)**\n- **Problem**: Determine if a graph can be properly 3-colored using a tree decomposition.\n- **Key Concepts**:\n  - **Tree Decomposition**: A tree-like structure where each node represents a subset of vertices (bag) in the graph.\n  - **Nice Tree Decomposition**: A tree decomposition with specific properties (e.g., introduce, forget, join nodes).\n  - **Dynamic Programming on Tree Decomposition**:\n    - Define `f(x, \u03c7)` where `x` is a node in the tree decomposition and `\u03c7` is a coloring of the bag `X_x`.\n    - `f(x, \u03c7)` is `TRUE` if `\u03c7` can be extended to a proper 3-coloring of the subtree rooted at `x`.\n  - **Recursive Cases**:\n    - **Introduce Node**: Add a vertex `v` to the bag. Ensure `v`\u2019s color differs from its neighbors in the bag.\n    - **Forget Node**: Remove a vertex `w` from the bag. Check all possible colorings of `w`.\n    - **Join Node**: Combine results from child nodes.\n- **Complexity**: Depends on the treewidth of the graph and the number of vertices.\n\n#### **4. Integer Linear Programming (ILP) (Questions 25-29)**\n- **Problem**: Understand the relationship between an ILP and its LP relaxation.\n- **Key Concepts**:\n  - **LP Relaxation**: Relax the integer constraints of an ILP to get a linear program (LP).\n  - **Feasibility**: If the LP relaxation is infeasible, the ILP is also infeasible.\n  - **Optimality**:\n    - The optimal value of the ILP is **greater than or equal to** the optimal value of the LP relaxation (for minimization problems).\n    - The ILP\u2019s optimal value can be equal to or greater than the LP\u2019s optimal value.\n    - The ILP can have an optimal value much larger than the LP\u2019s (e.g., `50 * 10^2331`).\n- **Key Observations**:\n  - The LP relaxation provides a lower bound for minimization ILPs.\n  - The ILP is not guaranteed to be feasible even if the LP relaxation is feasible.\n\n#### **5. Inclusion-Exclusion Principle (Questions 30-34)**\n- **Problem**: Count sequences of length `n` using digits `{0, 1, 2}` where each digit appears at least once.\n- **Key Concepts**:\n  - **Inclusion-Exclusion Principle**: Count the total number of sequences and subtract those that miss at least one digit.\n  - **Sets**:\n    - `A_i`: Sequences missing digit `i`.\n    - `|A_i| = 2^n` (sequences using only 2 digits).\n    - `|A_i \u2229 A_j| = 1` (sequences using only 1 digit, since `n >= 1`).\n    - `|A_0 \u2229 A_1 \u2229 A_2| = 0` (no sequences missing all 3 digits).\n  - **Formula**:\n    - Total \"bad\" sequences: `|A_0 \u222a A_1 \u222a A_2| = |A_0| + |A_1| + |A_2| - |A_0 \u2229 A_1| - |A_0 \u2229 A_2| - |A_1 \u2229 A_2| + |A_0 \u2229 A_1 \u2229 A_2|`.\n    - Valid sequences: `3^n - |A_0 \u222a A_1 \u222a A_2|`.\n- **Examples**:\n  - For `n=4`: Valid sequences = `3^4 - (3*2^4 - 3*1 + 0) = 81 - 48 + 3 = 36`.\n  - For `n=5`: Valid sequences = `3^5 - (3*2^5 - 3*1 + 0) = 243 - 96 + 3 = 150`.\n\n#### **6. Relatively Prime Numbers (Questions 35-36)**\n- **Problem**: Count numbers in `[1, r]` not relatively prime to `n` (i.e., share a common prime factor with `n`).\n- **Key Concepts**:\n  - **Prime Factors**: Let `p_1, ..., p_k` be the distinct prime factors of `n`.\n  - **Inclusion-Exclusion**:\n    - `S_i`: Numbers in `[1, r]` divisible by `p_i`.\n    - `|S_i| = floor(r / p_i)`.\n    - Total \"bad\" numbers: `|S_1 \u222a ... \u222a S_k| = sum(|S_i|) - sum(|S_i \u2229 S_j|) + ... + (-1)^(k+1) |S_1 \u2229 ... \u2229 S_k|`.\n  - **Valid Numbers**: `r - |S_1 \u222a ... \u222a S_k|`.\n\n#### **7. Matroids and Exchange Property (Questions 37-39)**\n- **Problem**: Analyze a family of sets with specific properties (hereditary, exchange).\n- **Key Concepts**:\n  - **Hereditary Property**: If `A` is in the family and `B \u2286 A`, then `B` is also in the family.\n  - **Exchange Property**: For sets `A` and `B` in the family where `|A| > |B|`, there exists `x \u2208 A \\ B` such that `B \u222a {x}` is in the family.\n  - **Matroid**: A family of sets satisfying both hereditary and exchange properties.\n- **Example**:\n  - **Good Sets**: Subsets of `n` couples with at most 3 couples. This family satisfies both hereditary and exchange properties.\n\n#### **8. Cluster Vertex Deletion (Questions 40-49)**\n- **Problem**: Determine if a graph can be made into a cluster graph by deleting at most `k` vertices.\n- **Key Concepts**:\n  - **Cluster Graph**: A graph where every connected component is a clique.\n  - **Induced Path**: A cluster graph has no induced path of length 3 (i.e., no three vertices `a-b-c` where `a` and `c` are not adjacent).\n  - **DISJOINT CLUSTER VERTEX DELETION**:\n    - Given a set `S` of `k+1` vertices where `G \\ S` is a cluster graph, find if there\u2019s a subset `T` of size at most `k` (disjoint from `S`) such that `G \\ T` is a cluster graph.\n  - **Reduction Rules**:\n    - If `G[S]` is not a cluster graph, return `NO`.\n    - If a vertex in `V(G) \\ S` is adjacent to vertices in two different cliques of `G[S]`, it must be deleted (decrease `k` by 1).\n    - If a vertex in `V(G) \\ S` is adjacent to some but not all vertices in a clique of `G[S]`, it must be deleted (decrease `k` by 1).\n  - **Complexity**: The problem is fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) with runtime `2^O(k log k) * n^O(1)`.\n\n#### **9. Perfect Matching in Trees (Question 50)**\n- **Problem**: Determine if a tree has a perfect matching.\n- **Key Concepts**:\n  - **Perfect Matching**: A set of edges where every vertex is included exactly once.\n  - **Algorithm**:\n    - **Algorithm A**: Greedily pick edges incident to the maximum degree vertex. **Incorrect** (may leave isolated vertices).\n    - **Algorithm B**: Greedily pick edges incident to a minimum degree (leaf) vertex. **Correct** (ensures no isolated vertices remain).\n  - **Observation**: Every tree with at least 2 vertices has at least one leaf (degree-1 vertex).\n\n#### **10. Max Flow (Questions 51-52)**\n- **Problem**: Determine if a given flow `f` is maximum in a flow network.\n- **Key Concepts**:\n  - **Max-Flow Min-Cut Theorem**: The maximum flow equals the capacity of the minimum cut.\n  - **Residual Graph**: A graph with residual capacities used to find augmenting paths.\n  - **Augmenting Path**: A path in the residual graph from source `s` to sink `t`.\n  - **Conditions for Maximum Flow**:\n    - No augmenting paths exist in the residual graph.\n    - Flow conservation and capacity constraints are satisfied.\n  - **LP Formulation for Max Flow**:\n    - Variables: `x_uv` for each edge `(u, v)`.\n    - Objective: Maximize `sum(x_ut)` (flow out of source).\n    - Constraints:\n      - `x_uv <= c_uv` (capacity).\n      - Flow conservation: `sum(x_uv) = sum(x_vw)` for all `v \u2260 s, t`.\n      - `x_uv >= 0`.\n\n#### **11. Probability and Independence (Question 53)**\n- **Problem**: Analyze the independence of random variables `Y = X1 * X2` and `Z = X2 * X3` where `X1, X2, X3` are dice rolls.\n- **Key Concepts**:\n  - **Independence**: `Y` and `Z` are not independent because they share `X2`.\n  - **Expectation**:\n    - `E[Y*Z] = E[X1*X2^2*X3]`.\n    - `E[Y]*E[Z] = E[X1*X2] * E[X2*X3]`.\n    - Since `E[Y*Z] \u2260 E[Y]*E[Z]`, `Y` and `Z` are not independent.\n\n#### **12. Careful 5-Coloring (Question 54)**\n- **Problem**: Determine if a graph has a \"careful\" 5-coloring where adjacent vertices differ by more than 1 (mod 5).\n- **Key Concepts**:\n  - **Reduction from 5-COLOR**: The careful 5-coloring problem is NP-hard because it generalizes the standard 5-coloring problem (where adjacent vertices must differ by at least 1).\n\n#### **13. Interval Scheduling (Question 55)**\n- **Problem**: Select a maximum set of non-overlapping intervals.\n- **Key Concepts**:\n  - **Greedy Algorithm**: Select intervals with the earliest finish time.\n  - **Optimality**: This greedy choice guarantees an optimal solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Mermaid Knowledge Graphs**\n\n#### **1.
