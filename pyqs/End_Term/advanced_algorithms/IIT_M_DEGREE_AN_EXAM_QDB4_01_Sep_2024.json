        "summary": "Here\u2019s a structured summary of the core topics, concepts, principles, and equations from the question paper, followed by Mermaid knowledge graphs for visualization.\n\n---\n\n### **Core Topics and Concepts**\n\n#### **1. Disk Stacking Problem (Questions 2-8)**\n- **Problem Statement**: Given a list of cuboid-shaped disks (each defined by width, depth, height), stack them to maximize total height. A disk can only be placed above another if its width, depth, and height are strictly smaller.\n- **Key Concepts**:\n  - **Dynamic Programming (DP)**: Use a DP table where `DP[i]` represents the maximum height achievable with disk `i` at the bottom.\n  - **Sorting**: Disks must be sorted by one or more dimensions to ensure correctness in DP transitions.\n  - **Greedy Approach**: Not directly applicable; DP is required due to overlapping subproblems.\n- **Equations**:\n  - Initialize: `DP[i] = height of disk i`.\n  - Transition: For each disk `i`, check all disks `j` where `j < i` and `disk_j` can be placed above `disk_i`. Update:\n    ```\n    DP[i] = max(DP[i], DP[j] + height of disk_i)\n    ```\n  - Final answer: `max(DP[i] for all i)`.\n- **Complexity**: `O(N^2)` for the DP approach (where `N` is the number of disks).\n\n---\n\n#### **2. Dice Roll Permutations (Questions 9-19)**\n- **Problem Statement**: Given `N` dice with `S` sides each, count the number of permutations of dice rolls that sum to a target `T`. Permutations with identical sums but different orders are distinct.\n- **Key Concepts**:\n  - **Dynamic Programming**: Use a 2D DP table `DP[N][T]` where `DP[n][t]` is the number of ways to achieve sum `t` with `n` dice.\n  - **Base Cases**:\n    - `DP[0][0] = 1` (0 dice sum to 0 in 1 way).\n    - `DP[0][t] = 0` for `t > 0` (no dice cannot sum to a positive target).\n    - `DP[n][0] = 0` for `n > 0` (cannot sum to 0 with positive dice).\n  - **Recurrence Relation**:\n    ```\n    DP[n][t] = sum_{s=1 to S} DP[n-1][t-s]\n    ```\n    (Sum over all possible outcomes `s` of the `n-th` die.)\n  - **Edge Cases**:\n    - If `T < N` or `T > N*S`, the answer is 0 (impossible to achieve).\n- **Complexity**: `O(N*S*T)` for the DP table.\n\n---\n\n#### **3. Graph 3-Coloring with Tree Decomposition (Questions 20-24)**\n- **Problem Statement**: Determine if a graph `G` can be properly 3-colored using a tree decomposition. A proper 3-coloring assigns colors 1, 2, or 3 to vertices such that no adjacent vertices share the same color.\n- **Key Concepts**:\n  - **Tree Decomposition**: A structure that decomposes a graph into a tree of clusters (bags) with specific properties.\n  - **Nice Tree Decomposition**: A tree decomposition with additional properties (e.g., introduce, forget, join nodes) to simplify DP.\n  - **Dynamic Programming on Tree Decomposition**:\n    - Define `f(x, \u03c7)` as `TRUE` if the coloring `\u03c7` of bag `X_x` can be extended to a proper 3-coloring of the subtree rooted at `x`.\n    - **Introduce Node**: If a vertex `v` is introduced, ensure `\u03c7(v)` differs from all neighbors in the bag.\n    - **Forget Node**: If a vertex `w` is forgotten, check all possible colorings of `w` in the child node.\n    - **Join Node**: For a join node `e` with children `g` and `h`, `f(e, \u03c7) = f(g, \u03c7) \u2227 f(h, \u03c7)`.\n- **Complexity**: `O(3^w * n)` where `w` is the treewidth of `G`.\n\n---\n\n#### **4. Integer Linear Programming (ILP) (Questions 25-29)**\n- **Problem Statement**: Given an ILP and its LP relaxation, analyze the relationship between their optimal solutions.\n- **Key Concepts**:\n  - **LP Relaxation**: Replace integer constraints with linear constraints to get a lower bound (for minimization) or upper bound (for maximization).\n  - **Feasibility**: The ILP may be infeasible even if the LP relaxation is feasible.\n  - **Optimality**:\n    - If the ILP is feasible, its optimal solution is **greater than or equal to** the LP relaxation's optimal solution (for minimization).\n    - The ILP's optimal solution may be equal to the LP relaxation's solution (if the LP solution is integral).\n    - The ILP's optimal solution can be arbitrarily large (e.g., `50 * 10^2331`) if the LP relaxation is unbounded or the ILP is designed that way.\n\n---\n\n#### **5. Inclusion-Exclusion Principle (Questions 30-34)**\n- **Problem Statement**: Count sequences of length `n` using digits 0, 1, 2 where each digit appears at least once.\n- **Key Concepts**:\n  - **Inclusion-Exclusion**: Count \"bad\" sequences (missing at least one digit) and subtract from the total.\n  - **Sets**:\n    - `A_i`: Sequences missing digit `i`.\n    - `|A_i| = 2^n` (sequences using only 2 digits).\n    - `|A_i \u2229 A_j| = 1` (sequences using only 1 digit, e.g., all 0s).\n    - `|A_0 \u2229 A_1 \u2229 A_2| = 0` (no sequences miss all 3 digits).\n  - **Formula**:\n    ```\n    Total sequences = 3^n\n    Bad sequences = |A_0 \u222a A_1 \u222a A_2| = 3*2^n - 3*1 + 0\n    Good sequences = 3^n - (3*2^n - 3)\n    ```\n  - **Example**: For `n=4`, good sequences = `3^4 - 3*2^4 + 3 = 81 - 48 + 3 = 36`.\n\n---\n\n#### **6. Relatively Prime Numbers (Questions 35-36)**\n- **Problem Statement**: Count numbers in `[1, r]` not relatively prime to `n` (i.e., share a common prime factor with `n`).\n- **Key Concepts**:\n  - **Prime Factors**: Let `p_1, ..., p_k` be the prime factors of `n`.\n  - **Sets**: `S_i`: Numbers in `[1, r]` divisible by `p_i`.\n  - **Inclusion-Exclusion**:\n    ```\n    |S_1 \u222a ... \u222a S_k| = sum(|S_i|) - sum(|S_i \u2229 S_j|) + ... + (-1)^(k+1) |S_1 \u2229 ... \u2229 S_k|\n    ```\n  - **Size of `S_i`**: `|S_i| = floor(r / p_i)`.\n  - **Answer**: Numbers **not** relatively prime to `n` = `|S_1 \u222a ... \u222a S_k|`.\n\n---\n\n#### **7. Matroids and Greedy Algorithms (Questions 37-39)**\n- **Problem Statement**: Analyze a family of \"good\" sets (subsets of `n` couples with at most 3 couples) for matroid properties.\n- **Key Concepts**:\n  - **Hereditary Property**: If `A` is good and `B \u2286 A`, then `B` is good. **True** for this family.\n  - **Exchange Property**: For good sets `A` and `B` with `|A| > |B|`, there exists `x \u2208 A \\ B` such that `B \u222a {x}` is good. **True** for this family.\n  - **Implications**: The family forms a matroid, so the greedy algorithm can find a maximum-weight good set.\n\n---\n\n#### **8. Cluster Vertex Deletion (Questions 40-49)**\n- **Problem Statement**: Given a graph `G` and integer `k`, determine if deleting at most `k` vertices makes `G` a cluster graph (disjoint union of cliques).\n- **Key Concepts**:\n  - **Cluster Graph**: No induced path of length 3 (i.e., no 3 vertices where only the first and last are connected).\n  - **Disjoint Cluster Vertex Deletion**: Given a set `S` of `k+1` vertices where `G \\ S` is a cluster graph, find a disjoint set `T` of size `\u2264 k` to delete.\n  - **Rules**:\n    - If `G[S]` is not a cluster graph, return **NO** (since `T` must be disjoint from `S`).\n    - If a vertex in `V \\ S` conflicts with `\u2265 2` cliques in `G[S]`, delete it and decrease `k` by 1.\n    - If a vertex in `V \\ S` is adjacent to some but not all vertices in a clique of `G[S]`, delete it (no change to `k`).\n  - **Complexity**: Fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) with runtime `2^O(k log k) * n^O(1)`.\n\n---\n\n#### **9. Perfect Matching in Trees (Question 50)**\n- **Problem Statement**: Determine if a tree `T` has a perfect matching (every vertex is matched to exactly one other).\n- **Key Concepts**:\n  - **Algorithm A**: Greedily match the highest-degree vertex. **Incorrect** (may leave unmatched vertices).\n  - **Algorithm B**: Greedily match a minimum-degree (non-zero) vertex. **Correct** (ensures no isolated vertices remain).\n  - **Hint**: Every tree with \u2265 2 vertices has a leaf (degree-1 vertex). Matching leaves iteratively works.\n\n---\n\n#### **10. Maximum Flow (Questions 51-52)**\n- **Problem Statement**: Verify if a flow `f` is maximum in a flow network `(G, s, t, c)`.\n- **Key Concepts**:\n  - **Max-Flow Min-Cut Theorem**: `f` is maximum iff the residual graph has no augmenting paths from `s` to `t`.\n  - **LP Formulation**: Maximize `sum(x_{s,u})` subject to:\n    - Capacity constraints: `x_{u,v} \u2264 c_{u,v}`.\n    - Flow conservation: `sum(x_{u,v}) = sum(x_{v,w})` for all `v \u2260 s, t`.\n    - Non-negativity: `x_{u,v} \u2265 0`.\n  - **Validity**: The given LP is correct for computing maximum flow.\n\n---\n\n#### **11. Independence of Random Variables (Question 53)**\n- **Problem Statement**: Let `Y = X_1 * X_2` and `Z = X_2 * X_3`, where `X_i` are independent dice rolls. Are `Y` and `Z` independent?\n- **Key Concepts**:\n  - **Dependence**: `Y` and `Z` share `X_2`, so they are **not independent**.\n  - **Expectation**: `E[Y*Z] = E[X_1 * X_2^2 * X_3] = E[X_1] * E[X_2^2] * E[X_3]` (since `X_i` are independent).\n    - `E[Y] * E[Z] = E[X_1 * X_2] * E[X_2 * X_3] = E[X_1] * E[X_2]^2 * E[X_3]`.\n    - Thus, `E[Y*Z] \u2260 E[Y] * E[Z]` unless `E[X_2^2] = E[X_2]^2` (not generally true).\n\n---\n\n#### **12. Careful 5-Coloring (Question 54)**\n- **Problem Statement**: Is deciding if a graph has a \"careful\" 5-coloring (adjacent vertices differ by > 1 mod 5) NP-hard?\n- **Key Concepts**:\n  - **Reduction**: Standard 5-coloring reduces to careful 5-coloring (assign colors `0, 2, 4` to avoid adjacent colors differing by 1).\n  - **NP-Hardness**: Since standard 5-coloring is NP-hard, careful 5-coloring is also NP-hard.\n\n---\n\n### **Mermaid Knowledge Graphs**\n\n#### **1.
