Darius, king of the Persian Empire, was furious because Athens had interceded for the other Greek city-states in revolt against Persian domination. In anger, the king sent an enormous army to defeat Athens. He thought it would take drastic steps to pacify the rebellious part of the empire. Persia was ruled by one man. In Athens, however, all citizens helped to rule. Ennobled by this participation, Athenians were prepared to die for their city-state. Perhaps this was the secret of the remarkable victory at Marathon, which freed them from Persian rule. On their way to Marathon, the Persians tried to fool some Greek city-states by claiming to have come in peace. The frightened citizens of Delos refused to believe this. Not wanting to abet the conquest of Greece, they fled from their city and did not return until the Persians had left. They were wise, for the Persians next conquered the city of Etria and captured its people. Tiny Athens stood alone against Persia. The Athenian people went to their sanctuaries. There they prayed for deliverance. They asked their gods to expedite their victory. The Athenians refurbished their weapons and moved to the plain of Marathon, where their little band would meet the Persians. At the last moment, soldiers from Plataea reinforced the Athenian troops. The Athenian army attacked, and Greek citizens fought bravely. The power of the mighty Persians was offset by the love that the Athenians had for their city. Athenians defeated the Persians in archery and hand combat. Greek soldiers seized Persian ships and burned them, and the Persians fled in terror. Herodotus, a famous historian, reports that 6400 Persians died, compared with only 192 Athenians.",

In anger, the king sent an enormous army to defeat Athens. He thought it would take drastic steps to pacify the rebellious part of the empire. Persia was ruled by one man. In Athens, however, all citizens helped to rule. Ennobled by this participation, Athenians were prepared to die for their city-state.

On their way to Marathon, the Persians tried to fool some Greek city-states by claiming to have come in peace. The frightened citizens of Delos refused to believe this. Not wanting to abet the conquest of Greece, they fled from their city and did not return until the Persians had left. They were wise, for the Persians next conquered the city of Etria and captured its people. Tiny Athens stood alone against Persia. The Athenian people went to their sanctuaries. There they prayed for deliverance. They asked their gods to expedite their victory. The Athenians refurbished their weapons and moved to the plain of Marathon, where their little band would meet the Persians. At the last moment, soldiers from Plataea reinforced the Athenian troops. The Athenian army attacked, and Greek citizens fought bravely. The power of the mighty Persians was offset by the love that the Athenians had for their city. Athenians defeated the Persians in archery and hand combat. Greek soldiers seized Persian ships and burned them, and the Persians fled in terror.

Darius, king of the Persian Empire, was furious because Athens had interceded for the other Greek city-states in revolt against Persian domination. In anger, the king sent an enormous army to defeat Athens. He thought it would take drastic steps to pacify the rebellious part of the empire. Persia was ruled by one man. In Athens, however, all citizens helped to rule. Ennobled by this participation, Athenians were prepared to die for their city-state. Perhaps this was the secret of the remarkable victory at Marathon, which freed them from Persian rule. On their way to Marathon, the Persians tried to fool some Greek city-states by claiming to have come in peace. The frightened citizens of Delos refused to believe this. Not wanting to abet the conquest of Greece, they fled from their city and did not return until the Persians had left. They were wise, for the Persians next conquered the city of Etria and captured its people. Tiny Athens stood alone against Persia. The Athenian people went to their sanctuaries. There they prayed for deliverance. They asked their gods to expedite their victory. The Athenians refurbished their weapons and moved to the plain of Marathon, where their little band would meet the Persians. At the last moment, soldiers from Plataea reinforced the Athenian troops. The Athenian army attacked, and Greek citizens fought bravely. The power of the mighty Persians was offset by the love that the Athenians had for their city. Athenians defeated the Persians in archery and hand combat. Greek soldiers seized Persian ships and burned them, and the Persians fled in terror. Herodotus, a famous historian, reports that 6400 Persians died, compared with only 192 Athenians.",

                            "Read the following passage and answer the given subquestions:\n\nThe victory of the small Greek democracy of Athens over the mighty Persian empire in 490 B.C. is one of the most famous events in history. Darius, king of the Persian Empire, was furious because Athens had interceded for the other Greek city-states in revolt against Persian domination. In anger, the king sent an enormous army to defeat Athens. He thought it would take drastic steps to pacify the rebellious part of the empire. Persia was ruled by one man. In Athens, however, all citizens helped to rule. Ennobled by this participation, Athenians were prepared to die for their city-state. Perhaps this was the secret of the remarkable victory at Marathon, which freed them from Persian rule. On their way to Marathon, the Persians tried to fool some Greek city-states by claiming to have come in peace. The frightened citizens of Delos refused to believe this. Not wanting to abet the conquest of Greece, they fled from their city and did not return until the Persians had left. They were wise, for the Persians next conquered the city of Etria and captured its people. Tiny Athens stood alone against Persia. The Athenian people went to their sanctuaries. There they prayed for deliverance. They asked their gods to expedite their victory. The Athenians refurbished their weapons and moved to the plain of Marathon, where their little band would meet the Persians. At the last moment, soldiers from Plataea reinforced the Athenian troops. The Athenian army attacked, and Greek citizens fought bravely. The power of the mighty Persians was offset by the love that the Athenians had for their city. Athenians defeated the Persians in archery and hand combat. Greek soldiers seized Persian ships and burned them, and the Persians fled in terror. Herodotus, a famous historian, reports that 6400 Persians died, compared with only 192 Athenians."

Darius, king of the Persian Empire, was furious because Athens had interceded for the other Greek city-states in revolt against Persian domination. In anger, the king sent an enormous army to defeat Athens. He thought it would take drastic steps to pacify the rebellious part of the empire. Persia was ruled by one man. In Athens, however, all citizens helped to rule. Ennobled by this participation, Athenians were prepared to die for their city-state. Perhaps this was the secret of the remarkable victory at Marathon, which freed them from Persian rule. On their way to Marathon, the Persians tried to fool some Greek city-states by claiming to have come in peace. The frightened citizens of Delos refused to believe this. Not wanting to abet the conquest of Greece, they fled from their city and did not return until the Persians had left. They were wise, for the Persians next conquered the city of Etria and captured its people. Tiny Athens stood alone against Persia. The Athenian people went to their sanctuaries. There they prayed for deliverance. They asked their gods to expedite their victory. The Athenians refurbished their weapons and moved to the plain of Marathon, where their little band would meet the Persians. At the last moment, soldiers from Plataea reinforced the Athenian troops. The Athenian army attacked, and Greek citizens fought bravely. The power of the mighty Persians was offset by the love that the Athenians had for their city. Athenians defeated the Persians in archery and hand combat. Greek soldiers seized Persian ships and burned them, and the Persians fled in terror.

        "summary": "Here\u2019s a structured summary of the **core topics, concepts, and principles** for the **\"Qualifier Level: English I (Computer-Based Exam)\"** based on the provided question paper.\nThe exam focuses on **vocabulary, grammar, comprehension, word collocations, and polite communication**.\n\n---\n\n---\n\n### **Core Topics & Concepts**\n#### **1. Vocabulary & Synonyms/Antonyms**\n   - **Key Skills**:\n     - Identifying synonyms/antonyms for words in context (e.g., \"ennoble\" = honor, \"expedite\" = hasten, \"refurbish\" = renovate).\n     - Understanding nuanced meanings (e.g., \"domination\" = control, \"pacify\" = calm down, \"combat\" = fight).\n     - Recognizing words with similar sounds but different meanings (e.g., \"steal\" has a **long vowel** /i\u02d0/, while \"precious\"/\"moustache\" carry the /\u0283/ \"sh\" sound; \"measure\" does not).\n   - **Common Word Pairs**:\n     | Word         | Synonym/Antonym/Meaning                     |\n     |--------------|---------------------------------------------|\n     | Ennoble      | Honor                                       |\n     | Expedite     | Hasten, accelerate                          |\n     | Refurbish    | Renovate, repair                            |\n     | Pacify       | Calm down                                   |\n     | Domination   | Control                                     |\n     | Combat       | Fight                                       |\n     | Impulsive    | Acting without thought                      |\n     | Abet         | Assist (often negatively, e.g., \"abet crime\") |\n     | Offset       | Counterbalance                              |\n     | Deliverance  | Rescue, liberation                          |\n\n   - **Vowel Sounds**:\n     - Short vowel /\u028a/: \"book\" (vs. \"cute\" /ju\u02d0/, \"music\" /ju\u02d0/, \"utensil\" /ju\u02d0/).\n     - Long vowel /i\u02d0/: \"steal,\" \"precious.\"\n\n---\n\n#### **2. Grammar**\n   - **Parts of Speech**:\n     - **Nouns**: Proper (e.g., \"America\"), abstract (e.g., \"deliverance\"), material (e.g., \"paint\"), class (e.g., \"shirt\").\n     - **Pronouns**: Subjective (e.g., \"I\" in \"My sister and **I** went\").\n     - **Verbs**: Action (e.g., \"brought,\" \"worried\"), helping verbs.\n     - **Adjectives**: Descriptive (e.g., \"loose,\" \"unique,\" \"amused\"), comparative (e.g., \"older\").\n     - **Adverbs**: Manner (e.g., \"quietly\"), time (e.g., \"eventually\" \u2192 **not an adjective**).\n     - **Articles**: \"A\" vs. \"an\" (e.g., \"an interesting film\" /\u028cn/, \"a unique design\" /ju\u02d0/).\n\n   - **Comparative/Superlative Adjectives**:\n     - Use \"than\" for comparisons (e.g., \"Sukriti is **older** than her sisters\").\n     - Superlative requires \"the\" (e.g., \"the oldest\").\n\n   - **Prepositions**:\n     - Purpose: \"prescription **for** a headache.\"\n     - Collocations: \"sponsored **by**,\" \"eager **for**,\" \"conscious **of**,\" \"associated **with**,\" \"inquiry **into**.\"\n\n---\n\n#### **3. Reading Comprehension**\n   - **Skills Tested**:\n     - Extracting explicit details (e.g., \"The frightened citizens of Delos **did not** abet the conquest\").\n     - Inferring meanings (e.g., \"offset\" = Athenians' love balanced Persian power).\n     - True/False questions (e.g., \"Darius took drastic steps to **weaken**, not strengthen, Athens\").\n   - **Passage Themes**:\n     - Historical events (e.g., Battle of Marathon).\n     - Moral lessons (e.g., unity, bravery, deception in war).\n\n---\n\n#### **4. Word Collocations**\n   - Fixed phrases where words naturally pair:\n     | Word        | Collocation  |\n     |-------------|--------------|\n     | Sponsored   | **by**       |\n     | Eager       | **for**      |\n     | Conscious   | **of**       |\n     | Associated  | **with**     |\n     | Inquiry     | **into**     |\n\n---\n\n#### **5. Polite Communication (Telephonic Conversations)**\n   - **Key Phrases**:\n     - Clarifying audio issues: \"Your voice is **breaking**,\" \"Is it **better** now?\"\n     - Identifying yourself: \"**Who am I speaking to**, please?\"\n     - Wrong number: \"Sorry, **I think you have the wrong number**.\"\n     - Closing politely: \"**No problem**, bye.\"\n   - **Tone**: Always formal and courteous.\n\n---\n\n#### **6. Idioms & Common Expressions**\n   - **Weight Loss**: \"Out of **shape**\" (unfit).\n   - **Work Updates**: \"Keep me in the **loop**\" (keep informed).\n   - **Inaudible Voice**: \"There is none of that **number** here\" (incorrect; this phrase is for wrong numbers, not inaudibility).\n\n---\n\n#### **7. Common Mistakes to Avoid**\n   - **Articles**: \"An\" before vowel **sounds** (e.g., \"an **hour**\" /a\u028a\u0259/, not \"a hour\").\n   - **Pronouns**: \"My sister and **I**\" (subject) vs. \"me\" (object).\n   - **Adjectives/Adverbs**: \"Quietly\" (adverb) vs. \"quiet\" (adjective).\n   - **Collocations**: \"Inquiry **into**\" (not \"inquiry for\").\n\n---\n\n### **Mermaid Knowledge Graphs**\n#### **1.
