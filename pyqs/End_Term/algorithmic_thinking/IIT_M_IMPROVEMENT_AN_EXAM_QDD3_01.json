                        "You are studying the signalling pathway system of an alien world. Existing literature shows that information in the alien world is transmitted in the following procedure.  \u201cA receptor protein in the cell membrane transmits information to a series of three kinase proteins that are sequentially activated inside the cell. The final activated kinase causes a transcription factor (TF) to get activated and translocated to the nucleus, wherein the TF protein regulates a target gene.\u201d  As part of your research, you construct the underlying signalling network, and want to find the most probable pathway along which a specific gene g will receive the information from a receptor on the cell membrane. Will it suffice to use 10 colors to determine the most probable pathway?"

        "summary": "Here\u2019s a structured **summary of core topics, concepts, principles, and equations** for the exam **\"Algorithmic Thinking in Bioinformatics\"**, along with **Mermaid knowledge graphs** to visualize relationships.\n\n---\n\n---\n\n### **1. Core Topics & Concepts**\n#### **A. Graph Representations in Bioinformatics**\n1. **Adjacency Matrix for Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs)**\n   - Represent interactions between genes as a binary matrix (`1` = regulation, `0` = no regulation).\n   - **Storage**: For an `n x n` matrix, storage = `n\u00b2 * bytes_per_element` (e.g., 6x6 matrix \u2192 36 bytes).\n   - **Key Idea**: Directed edges represent regulation (e.g., `G1 \u2192 G2`).\n\n2. **Ultrametric Trees & UPGMA**\n   - **Ultrametric Property**: Distance from root to any leaf is equal (molecular clock hypothesis).\n   - **UPGMA Algorithm**:\n     - Agglomerative clustering where merge distance = `2 * height_of_node`.\n     - **Example**: If node `N` has age 15, distance between children `N1` and `N2` = `30` (since `distance = 2 * age`).\n   - **Tree Height to Age**:\n     - If mutations occur every `T` years and height = `h`, root age = `h * T`.\n     - **Example**: Height = 5, `T = 10M` years \u2192 root age = `50M` years.\n\n3. **De Bruijn Graphs for Genome Assembly**\n   - **Nodes**: `(k-1)-mers` of reads.\n   - **Edges**: `k-mers` (overlap of length `k-1`).\n   - **Linear Genome Reconstruction**:\n     - Start from a node with **out-degree > in-degree** (or fixed start node).\n     - **Eulerian Path**: Traverse edges to reconstruct the sequence.\n   - **Key Observations**:\n     - If `k-mers` for nodes `N1` and `N2` are fixed and traversal starts from `N1`, **only 1 genome** is possible.\n     - If traversal can start from either node, **2 genomes** are possible (reverse complement).\n   - **Example**: For 2 nodes with 6 edges (3 bidirectional), possible genomes must alternate (e.g., `ATATATAT` or `TGTGTGTG`).\n\n4. **Breakpoint Graphs & Genome Rearrangements**\n   - **Synteny Blocks**: Signed permutations representing gene order (e.g., `+4 +5 -1 -3 -2`).\n   - **2-Break Operations**: Reversals, translocations, fusions, or fissions.\n   - **Breakpoint Graph**:\n     - Connect adjacent blocks in genomes and cap ends with `\u22a5`.\n     - **Cycles**: Each cycle requires `(# edges - 1)` operations to sort.\n   - **Example**: Converting `Cat` to `Spike` requires **2 operations** (2 minutes).\n\n---\n\n#### **B. Clustering & Motif Finding**\n1. **Hard K-Means Clustering**\n   - **Steps**:\n     1. Assign points to nearest centroid.\n     2. Recompute centroids as mean of assigned points.\n     3. Repeat until convergence (no change in assignments).\n   - **Example**: For points `X(1,3), Y(4,2), Z(5,7), W(9,6), V(8,5)` and `K=2`:\n     - **Termination**: 2 iterations.\n     - **Final Centroids**: `(2.5, 2.5)` (cluster: X, Y), `(7.33, 6)` (cluster: Z, W, V).\n\n2. **Expectation-Maximization (EM) for Motif Finding**\n   - **E-Step**: Compute posterior probabilities of latent variables (e.g., motif positions).\n   - **M-Step**: Update parameters (e.g., motif PWM) to maximize likelihood.\n   - **Free Parameters**:\n     - For a motif of length `L` and alphabet size `4` (DNA), learn `4L - 4` parameters (due to probability constraints).\n     - **Example**: `L=5` \u2192 `15` free parameters (`4*5 - 5` for background model).\n   - **False Statements**:\n     - EM **does not guarantee global maximum** (only local).\n     - EM **can handle continuous data** (e.g., Gaussian mixtures).\n\n3. **Gibbs Sampling vs. Randomized Motif Search**\n   - **Gibbs Sampling**: Stochastically samples motifs by excluding one sequence at a time.\n   - **Randomized Motif Search**: Greedily picks the best `k-mer` in each sequence.\n   - **Difference**: Outputs **differ** even for the same initial motifs.\n\n---\n\n#### **C. Sequence Alignment & Dynamic Programming**\n1. **Needleman-Wunsch Algorithm (Global Alignment)**\n   - **Scoring**:\n     - Match: `+1`, Mismatch: `0`, Gap: `0`.\n   - **Recurrence**:\n     - `DP[i][j] = max(DP[i-1][j-1] + score(s[i], t[j]), DP[i-1][j], DP[i][j-1])`.\n   - **Example**: Aligning `AGTGT` and `TATGT` yields **4 cells with score 3**.\n\n2. **Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT)**\n   - **Steps**:\n     1. Append `$` to the string.\n     2. Generate all cyclic rotations.\n     3. Sort rotations lexicographically.\n     4. Extract last column \u2192 BWT encoded string.\n   - **Decoding**:\n     - Reconstruct original string using **LF mapping** (last-to-first column).\n   - **Example**:\n     - Encoded: `EHID$LPREAETN` \u2192 Original: `ELEPHANTRIDES$`.\n     - **Suffix Array**: `[12, 5, 10, 11, 0, 2, 4, 9, 1, 6, 3, 8, 7]`.\n\n---\n\n#### **D. Mass Spectrometry & Peptide Sequencing**\n1. **Theoretical Spectrum**\n   - For a peptide, include:\n     - Prefix masses (e.g., `0, 71, 71+103, ...`).\n     - Subpeptide masses (e.g., `113` for `I`).\n     - Full peptide mass (e.g., `400`).\n   - **Scoring**: Count matches between theoretical and experimental spectrum.\n   - **Trimming Rule**: If `SCORE(P, Spectrum) < 0.75 * n`, trim peptide `P`.\n   - **Example**: Peptide `CIL` has `n=12` theoretical masses. If `SCORE < 9`, trim.\n\n2. **Leaderboard Cyclopeptide Sequencing**\n   - **Expand**: Add all possible amino acids to peptides.\n   - **Prune**: Keep top `-scoring` peptides.\n\n---\n\n#### **E. Deep Learning for Motif Detection**\n1. **One-Hot Encoding**\n   - Represent nucleotides as binary vectors:\n     - `A: [1,0,0,0]`, `C: [0,1,0,0]`, `G: [0,0,1,0]`, `T: [0,0,0,1]`.\n   - **Example**: Decoded sequence `3 2 4 3` \u2192 `G, C, T, G` (if `1=A, 2=C, 3=G, 4=T`).\n   - **Motif Length (`k`)**: Number of columns in the encoding matrix (e.g., `4`).\n\n---\n\n---\n\n### **2.

Exam Tips**\n1. **Graph Problems**:\n   - For **adjacency matrices**, count edges and multiply by byte size.\n   - For **ultrametric trees**, remember `distance = 2 * age`.\n   - For **de Bruijn graphs**, check for Eulerian paths and node degrees.\n\n2. **Clustering**:\n   - K-Means converges when assignments stop changing. Track centroids per iteration.\n\n3. **EM Algorithm**:\n   - False statements: **No global maximum guarantee**, and it **can handle continuous data**.\n\n4. **BWT**:\n   - Decoding requires reconstructing the **first column** from the last column using LF mapping.\n\n5. **Dynamic Programming**:\n   - Fill the DP table row-wise, tracking matches/mismatches/gaps.\n\n6. **Breakpoint Graphs**:\n   - Count cycles to determine the minimum operations needed.\n\n7. **Motif Finding**:\n   - For EM, free parameters = `4L - 4` (for DNA motifs of length `L`).",
