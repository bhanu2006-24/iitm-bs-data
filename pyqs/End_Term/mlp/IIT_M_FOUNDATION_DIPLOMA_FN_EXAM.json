Dimensionality Reduction & Feature Engineering**\n#### **Key Concepts:**\n- **Feature Importance**: Tree-based models provide feature importance scores.\n- **PCA**: Linear dimensionality reduction (not covered in questions).\n- **DictVectorizer**: Converts categorical features to numerical (one-hot encoding).\n\n---\n\n### **G. Special Topics**\n1. **Data Snooping**:\n   - Peeking at test data \u2192 **biased estimates**, **increased false positives**.\n2. **Ordinal vs. Nominal Variables**:\n   - **Ordinal**: Ordered categories (e.g., satisfaction ratings).\n   - **Nominal**: Unordered categories (e.g., blood type).\n3. **Dummy Classifier**:\n   - Baseline model (e.g., `strategy='most_frequent'` always predicts the majority class).\n4. **Perceptron**:\n   - Linear classifier (binary).\n   - `tol`: Tolerance for stopping criteria.\n   - `shuffle`: Whether to shuffle data before each epoch.\n\n---\n\n## **2.

Exam Tips**\n1. **Pandas/Numpy**: Focus on `shape`, `isna()`, `value_counts()`, `query`, `iloc`, and handling `NaN`.\n2. **Sklearn Models**:\n   - Know default parameters (e.g., `SGDRegressor` uses `max_iter` for epochs).\n   - Understand `alpha` in Ridge/Lasso vs. `C` in Logistic Regression (inverse relationship).\n3. **Evaluation Metrics**:\n   - Confusion matrix \u2192 Precision/Recall/F1.\n   - Regression \u2192 R\u00b2, MSE.\n4. **Clustering**:\n   - K-Means: Inertia = within-cluster sum of squares.\n   - Agglomerative: Hierarchical, uses linkage methods.\n5. **Ensemble Methods**:\n   - Random Forest: `bootstrap=True` by default.\n   - Bagging vs. Boosting: Parallel vs. sequential.\n6. **Hyperparameter Tuning**:\n   - Grid search combinations = product of parameter options.\n   - LOO CV trains \\( n \\) models for \\( n \\) samples.\n\n---\n**Final Note**: Focus on **code snippets**, **parameter interpretations**, and **mathematical formulas** for regression/classification metrics.
