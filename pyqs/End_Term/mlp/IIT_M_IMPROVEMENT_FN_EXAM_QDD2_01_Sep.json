Core Topics & Concepts**\n### **A. Pandas & Data Handling**\n#### **Key Concepts:**\n1. **DataFrame Operations**:\n   - Shape: `df.shape` \u2192 `(rows, columns)`.\n   - Missing values: `df.isna().sum().sum()` \u2192 Total missing values.\n   - Value counts: `df.column.value_counts()` \u2192 Frequency of unique values.\n   - Querying: `df.query(\"condition\")` \u2192 Filter rows.\n   - Indexing: `df.iloc[:, n]` \u2192 Select column `n`; `df.loc[index, column]` \u2192 Select by label.\n   - Mean/aggregations: `df.column.mean()` (ignores `NaN` by default).\n\n2. **Handling Missing Data**:\n   - Drop: `df.dropna()`.\n   - Impute: `KNNImputer(n_neighbors=k)` (for numerical data).\n\n3. **Data Types**:\n   - `float64` (default for decimals), `int64`, `object` (strings/categorical).\n   - Check dtypes: `df.dtypes`.\n\n#### **Key Equations (Pandas):**\n- **Mean (ignoring `NaN`)**:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Mean} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i}{\\text{count of non-NaN values}}\n  \\]\n- **Value Counts**: Frequency of each unique value in a column.\n\n---\n\n### **B. Scikit-Learn Workflow**\n#### **Key Concepts:**\n1. **Data Preprocessing**:\n   - **Scaling**:\n     - `StandardScaler` (standardizes to mean=0, std=1).\n     - `MinMaxScaler` (scales to `[0, 1]`).\n   - **Polynomial Features**:\n     - `PolynomialFeatures(degree=d, include_bias=True/False)`.\n     - If `include_bias=True`, adds a column of `1`s (for intercept).\n   - **Encoding**:\n     - `DictVectorizer` (for feature extraction from dictionaries).\n     - `OneHotEncoder` (for categorical variables).\n\n2. **Train-Test Split**:\n   - `train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)`.\n   - `random_state` ensures reproducibility.\n\n3. **Pipelines**:\n   - `make_pipeline(step1, step2, ...)` \u2192 Sequential processing (e.g., impute \u2192 scale \u2192 model).\n   - Example:\n     ```python\n     pipe = Pipeline([\n         ('imputer', KNNImputer(n_neighbors=3)),\n         ('scaler', StandardScaler()),\n         ('model', LinearRegression())\n     ])\n     ```\n\n4. **Model Evaluation**:\n   - **Regression**: `R\u00b2 score` (`model.score(X_test, y_test)`).\n   - **Classification**:\n     - `precision_score`, `recall_score`, `confusion_matrix`.\n     - `DummyClassifier(strategy='most_frequent')` \u2192 Predicts the majority class.\n\n#### **Key Equations (Preprocessing):**\n- **Standard Scaling**:\n  \\[\n  x_{\\text{scaled}} = \\frac{x - \\mu}{\\sigma}\n  \\]\n  where \\(\\mu\\) = mean, \\(\\sigma\\) = standard deviation.\n- **Min-Max Scaling**:\n  \\[\n  x_{\\text{scaled}} = \\frac{x - x_{\\min}}{x_{\\max} - x_{\\min}}\n  \\]\n- **Polynomial Features**:\n  For `degree=2` and features \\([x_1, x_2]\\), output includes \\([1, x_1, x_2, x_1^2, x_1x_2, x_2^2]\\) (if `include_bias=True`).\n\n---\n\n### **C.
