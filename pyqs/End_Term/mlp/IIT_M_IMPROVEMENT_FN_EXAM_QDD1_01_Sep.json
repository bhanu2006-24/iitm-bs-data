Exam Tips**\n1. **Pandas**:\n   - Know how to count non-missing values (`df.shape[0]*df.shape[1] - df.isna().sum().sum()`).\n   - Use `value_counts()` for frequency tables.\n\n2. **Scikit-Learn**:\n   - **Initialization**: Check default parameters (e.g., `SGDRegressor(max_iter=1000)`).\n   - **Pipelines**: Use `make_pipeline` for sequential preprocessing + modeling.\n   - **Evaluation**: `model.score(X, y)` returns \\( R^2 \\) for regression and accuracy for classification.\n\n3. **Algorithms**:\n   - **Decision Trees**: `max_depth` controls overfitting.\n   - **SVM**: `C` controls regularization; higher `C` = less regularization.\n   - **KNN**: `n_neighbors` affects bias-variance tradeoff (high `n` = smoother boundaries).\n\n4. **Clustering**:\n   - **K-Means**: `inertia_` = within-cluster sum of squares.\n   - **Agglomerative**: Assigns outliers to the nearest cluster.\n\n5. **Evaluation Metrics**:\n   - **Precision/Recall Tradeoff**: High precision = fewer FP; high recall = fewer FN.\n   - **Dummy Classifier**: Baseline for comparison (e.g., `strategy='most_frequent'`).\n\n6. **Avoid Common Mistakes**:\n   - **Data Leakage**: Never fit scalers/imputers on the entire dataset before train-test split.\n   - **Parameter Names**: `alpha` in Ridge/Lasso vs. `C` in LogisticRegression/SVM (they are inverses!).\n   - **Voting Classifier**: `voting='soft'` requires estimators with `predict_proba`.",
