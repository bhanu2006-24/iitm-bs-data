        "summary": "Here\u2019s a structured **summary of core topics, concepts, principles, and equations** essential for the exam, followed by **Mermaid knowledge graphs** to visualize relationships.\n\n---\n\n## **Core Topics & Concepts**\n### **1. Statistical Hypothesis Testing (Chi-Square Test for Uniformity)**\n- **Objective**: Test if data follows a uniform distribution.\n- **Key Steps**:\n  1. **Define Bins**: Group data into intervals (e.g., [75-100], [100-125]).\n  2. **Expected Frequency (E)**:\n     For uniform distribution:\n     \\[\n     E = \\frac{\\text{Total Observations}}{\\text{Number of Bins}}\n     \\]\n  3. **Degrees of Freedom (df)**:\n     \\[\n     df = \\text{Number of Bins} - 1 - \\text{Number of Estimated Parameters}\n     \\]\n     (For uniform distribution, no parameters are estimated, so \\(df = \\text{bins} - 1\\)).\n  4. **Chi-Square Statistic**:\n     \\[\n     \\chi^2 = \\sum \\frac{(O_i - E_i)^2}{E_i}\n     \\]\n     where \\(O_i\\) = observed frequency, \\(E_i\\) = expected frequency.\n  5. **Decision Rule**:\n     - Reject \\(H_0\\) if \\(\\chi^2 > \\chi^2_{\\text{critical}}\\) (from chi-square table).\n     - **Example**: If \\(\\chi^2_{\\text{calculated}} = 9.8\\) and \\(\\chi^2_{\\text{table}} = 10.59\\), reject \\(H_0\\) (data does **not** follow uniform distribution).\n\n---\n\n### **2. Independence Testing (Chi-Square Test for Independence)**\n- **Objective**: Test if two categorical variables (e.g., sales in Street-A and Street-B) are independent.\n- **Key Steps**:\n  1. **Contingency Table**: Cross-tabulate observed frequencies.\n  2. **Expected Frequency (E)**:\n     \\[\n     E_{ij} = \\frac{(\\text{Row Total}_i) \\times (\\text{Column Total}_j)}{\\text{Grand Total}}\n     \\]\n  3. **Degrees of Freedom (df)**:\n     \\[\n     df = (\\text{Rows} - 1) \\times (\\text{Columns} - 1)\n     \\]\n  4. **Chi-Square Statistic**: Same as above.\n  5. **Example**: For 15 days (rows) and 2 streets (columns), \\(df = (15-1)(2-1) = 14\\).\n\n---\n\n### **3. Probability & Conditional Probability**\n- **Total Probability Rule**:\n  \\[\n  P(A) = \\sum P(A|B_i) \\cdot P(B_i)\n  \\]\n- **Bayes\u2019 Theorem**:\n  \\[\n  P(B_i|A) = \\frac{P(A|B_i) \\cdot P(B_i)}{P(A)}\n  \\]\n- **Example (Q9-12)**:\n  - Probability of traveling by Scooty:\n    \\[\n    P(\\text{Scooty}) = P(\\text{Scooty}|X)P(X) + P(\\text{Scooty}|Y)P(Y) + P(\\text{Scooty}|Z)P(Z)\n    \\]\n  - Expected customers by Bus (Q10):\n    \\[\n    \\text{Expected} = 400 \\times P(\\text{Bus})\n    \\]\n  - Revenue from parking (Q11):\n    \\[\n    \\text{Revenue} = 600 \\times [P(\\text{Car}|X) \\times 20 + P(\\text{Scooty}|X) \\times 10]\n    \\]\n\n---\n\n### **4. Linear Demand & Pricing Optimization**\n- **Demand Function**:\n  \\[\n  D(p) = a - b \\cdot p\n  \\]\n  where \\(a\\) = market size, \\(b\\) = slope.\n- **Revenue Maximization**:\n  \\[\n  R(p) = p \\cdot D(p) = p(a - bp)\n  \\]\n  - **Optimal Price for Revenue**:\n    \\[\n    p^* = \\frac{a}{2b}\n    \\]\n- **Profit Maximization**:\n  \\[\n  \\pi(p) = (p - c) \\cdot D(p)\n  \\]\n  - **Optimal Price for Profit**:\n    \\[\n    p^* = \\frac{a + bc}{2b}\n    \\]\n- **Elasticity**:\n  \\[\n  E = \\frac{dD}{dp} \\cdot \\frac{p}{D} = -b \\cdot \\frac{p}{D}\n  \\]\n  - **Example (Q36)**: At \\(p = 50\\), \\(D(50) = 100\\), \\(E = -1.25 \\cdot \\frac{50}{100} = -0.625\\) (absolute value = 0.625, but answer is 1.25\u2014likely a miscalculation; recheck slope \\(b\\)).\n\n---\n\n### **5. Linear Programming (LP) & Duality**\n- **Primal Problem (Maximization)**:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Max } Z = \\sum c_j x_j\n  \\]\n  Subject to:\n  \\[\n  \\sum a_{ij} x_j \\leq b_i \\quad \\text{(Constraints)}\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  x_j \\geq 0\n  \\]\n- **Dual Problem (Minimization)**:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Min } W = \\sum b_i y_i\n  \\]\n  Subject to:\n  \\[\n  \\sum a_{ij} y_i \\geq c_j\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  y_i \\geq 0\n  \\]\n- **Key Relationships**:\n  - Number of dual variables = number of primal constraints.\n  - RHS of dual constraints = coefficients of primal objective.\n  - **Example (Q15-20)**:\n    - Primal decision variables = 4 (Apples, Oranges, Mangoes, Bananas).\n    - Dual decision variables = 9 (from primal constraints).\n    - Binding constraints: If a constraint is tight (e.g., budget), its dual variable is non-zero.\n\n---\n\n### **6. Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA)**\n- **Efficiency Score**:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Efficiency} = \\frac{\\text{Weighted Output}}{\\text{Weighted Input}}\n  \\]\n- **Linear Programming Formulation**:\n  - Convert ratio to linear form using **Charnes-Cooper transformation**.\n  - **Dual Variables**: Represent weights for inputs/outputs.\n- **Composite Unit**: Hypothetical unit formed by connecting origin to DMU on the frontier.\n- **Example (Q27)**:\n  - Efficiency of DMU3 = 0.8.\n  - Total Profit in HCU4 = Weighted sum of outputs from peer DMUs (3 and 5).\n\n---\n\n### **7. Conjoint Analysis**\n- **Objective**: Estimate utility of product attributes.\n- **Approaches**:\n  1. **Statistical/Regression**: Uses rated preference data (continuous).\n  2. **Choice-Based**: Consumers choose among full profiles (discrete choice).\n- **LP Model for Pairwise Judgments**:\n  - Minimize \"poorness of fit\" (deviations from observed preferences).\n- **Example (Q28)**: Choice-based conjoint involves selecting preferred options from sets.\n\n---\n\n### **8. Classification Metrics**\n- **Confusion Matrix**:\n  |               | **Actual Positive** | **Actual Negative** |\n  |---------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n  | **Predict +** | True Positive (TP)  | False Positive (FP) |\n  | **Predict -** | False Negative (FN) | True Negative (TN)  |\n- **Metrics**:\n  - **Accuracy**:\n    \\[\n    \\frac{TP + TN}{TP + TN + FP + FN}\n    \\]\n  - **Precision (Class 1)**:\n    \\[\n    \\frac{TP}{TP + FP}\n    \\]\n  - **Recall (Class 1)**:\n    \\[\n    \\frac{TP}{TP + FN}\n    \\]\n- **Example (Q29-33)**:\n  - TP = 6 (Completed & Predicted Completed).\n  - FP = 3 (Not Completed but Predicted Completed).\n\n---\n\n### **9. Linear Demand-Response Curve Fitting**\n- **Equation**:\n  \\[\n  D(p) = a - b p\n  \\]\n  where:\n  - \\(a\\) = market size (demand at \\(p = 0\\)).\n  - \\(b\\) = slope (rate of demand change per unit price).\n- **Satiating Price**: Price where \\(D(p) = 0\\):\n  \\[\n  p_{\\text{satiating}} = \\frac{a}{b}\n  \\]\n- **Example (Q34-35)**:\n  - Fit line to \\((p, D)\\) points (e.g., (10,200), (20,175)).\n  - Slope \\(b = \\frac{\\Delta D}{\\Delta p} = \\frac{175-200}{20-10} = -2.5\\).\n  - Intercept \\(a = D(p) + b p = 200 + 2.5 \\times 10 = 225\\).\n  - Satiating price: \\(225 / 2.5 = 90\\).\n\n---\n\n## **Mermaid Knowledge Graphs**\n### **Graph 1: Statistical Testing Relationships**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Hypothesis Testing] --> B[Chi-Square Test]\n    B --> C[Uniformity Test]\n    B --> D[Independence Test]\n    C --> E[Expected Frequency: Uniform]\n    C --> F[Degrees of Freedom: Bins - 1]\n    D --> G[Contingency Table]\n    D --> H[Degrees of Freedom: (Rows-1)*(Cols-1)]\n    E --> I[Chi-Square Statistic]\n    F --> I\n    G --> I\n    H --> I\n    I --> J[Compare to Critical Value]\n    J --> K[Reject/Fail to Reject Null]\n```\n\n### **Graph 2: Probability & Decision Making**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Probability] --> B[Total Probability]\n    A --> C[Bayes Theorem]\n    B --> D[Marginal Probability]\n    C --> E[Conditional Probability]\n    D --> F[Expected Value Calculations]\n    E --> F\n    F --> G[Revenue from Parking]\n    F --> H[Customers by Transport Mode]\n    G --> I[Location X: Car/Scooty]\n    H --> J[Bus/Scooty/Car Preferences]\n```\n\n### **Graph 3: Linear Programming & Duality**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Linear Programming] --> B[Primal Problem]\n    A --> C[Dual Problem]\n    B --> D[Objective: Maximize Revenue]\n    B --> E[Constraints: Budget, Quantity]\n    C --> F[Objective: Minimize Cost]\n    C --> G[Constraints: Shadow Prices]\n    D --> H[Decision Variables: Fruits]\n    E --> I[Binding/Non-Binding]\n    I --> J[Dual Variables]\n    J --> K[Zero if Constraint Not Binding]\n```\n\n### **Graph 4: DEA & Efficiency**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[DEA] --> B[Efficiency Score]\n    A --> C[Linear Programming]\n    B --> D[Weighted Output/Input]\n    C --> E[Charnes-Cooper Transformation]\n    D --> F[Peer DMUs]\n    F --> G[Composite Unit]\n    E --> H[Dual Variables as Weights]\n    H --> I[Frontier Analysis]\n```\n\n### **Graph 5: Demand & Pricing**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Demand Curve] --> B[Linear: D(p) = a - b*p]\n    B --> C[Revenue Maximization]\n    B --> D[Profit Maximization]\n    C --> E[Optimal Price: a/2b]\n    D --> F[Optimal Price: (a + b*c)/2b]\n    B --> G[Elasticity: -b*p/D]\n    G --> H[Price Sensitivity]\n    E --> I[Example: Revenue at p=11538]\n    F --> J[Example: Profit at p=15538]\n```\n\n### **Graph 6: Classification Metrics**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Confusion Matrix] --> B[True Positive]\n    A --> C[False Positive]\n    A --> D[False Negative]\n    A --> E[True Negative]\n    B --> F[Precision: TP/(TP+FP)]\n    C --> F\n    B --> G[Recall: TP/(TP+FN)]\n    D --> G\n    B --> H[Accuracy: (TP+TN)/Total]\n    E --> H\n```",
