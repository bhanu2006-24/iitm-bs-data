Conjoint Analysis**\n**Purpose**: Understand customer preferences for product attributes (e.g., engine capacity, LED lights).\n**Types**:\n- Choice-based\n- Adaptive-based\n- Full-profile\n- Menu-based\n**Key Points**:\n- **Pairwise comparisons**: For `n` products, number of pairs = `n(n-1)/2` (e.g., 4 products \u2192 6 pairs).\n- **Data format for regression-based conjoint**:\n  - Dependent variable: Consumer rankings/ratings (ordinal).\n  - Independent variables: Categorical attributes (dummy-coded).\n- **Total profiles to rate**: Multiply choices (e.g., 3 brands \u00d7 2 engines \u00d7 3 gearboxes = **18 profiles**).\n\n**Equation**:\n- **Utility function** (for regression-based conjoint):\n  \\[\n  U = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_1 + \\beta_2 X_2 + \\dots + \\beta_k X_k + \\epsilon\n  \\]\n  where \\(X_i\\) = dummy variables for attributes.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Hypothesis Testing (Chi-Square Tests)**\n**A. Chi-Square Test of Independence**\n- **Null Hypothesis (H\u2080)**: Variables are independent.\n- **Decision Rule**:\n  - If **p-value < \u03b1 (significance level)**, reject H\u2080 (variables are **not independent**).\n  - Example: p-value = 0.05, \u03b1 = 0.1 \u2192 **Reject H\u2080** (Q3).\n\n**B. Chi-Square Goodness-of-Fit Test**\n- **Null Hypothesis (H\u2080)**: Data follows a specified distribution (e.g., uniform, normal).\n- **Test Statistic**:\n  \\[\n  \\chi^2 = \\sum \\frac{(O_i - E_i)^2}{E_i}\n  \\]\n  where \\(O_i\\) = observed frequency, \\(E_i\\) = expected frequency.\n- **Degrees of Freedom (df)**:\n  - For uniform distribution: `df = k - 1` (k = number of bins).\n  - For normal distribution: `df = k - 1 - 2` (subtract 2 for mean and variance estimation).\n  - Example: 6 bins \u2192 `df = 6 - 1 - 2 = 3` (Q21).\n\n**Key Points**:\n- **Expected frequency** for uniform distribution:\n  \\[\n  E_i = \\frac{\\text{Total observations}}{\\text{Number of bins}}\n  \\]\n  Example: 9 observations, 6 bins \u2192 \\(E_i = 1.5\\) (Q19).\n- **Interpretation**:\n  - High \\(\\chi^2\\) \u2192 Reject H\u2080 (data does **not** follow the distribution).\n\n---\n\n### **3.

Linear Programming (LP) & Duality**\n**Key Points**:\n- **Primal LP**: Maximization problem with constraints.\n- **Dual LP**:\n  - Variables = number of primal constraints.\n  - If a primal constraint is **not binding** (slack > 0), its dual variable = **0** (Q14).\n- **Example**:\n  - Primal has 2 constraints \u2192 Dual has **2 variables**.\n  - Non-binding constraints \u2192 Dual variables = 0.\n\n---\n\n### **5.
