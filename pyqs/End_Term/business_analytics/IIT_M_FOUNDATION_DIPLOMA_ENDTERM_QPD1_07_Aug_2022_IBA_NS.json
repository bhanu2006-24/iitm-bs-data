Conjoint Analysis**\n**Purpose**: Understand customer preferences for product attributes (e.g., engine capacity, LED lights).\n**Types**:\n- Choice-based\n- Adaptive-based\n- Full-profile\n- Menu-based\n**Key Formulas**:\n- **Number of profiles to rate**:\n  If a customer has `B` brand choices, `E` engine options, and `G` gearbox types, total profiles = `B \u00d7 E \u00d7 G`.\n  *(Example: 3 brands \u00d7 2 engines \u00d7 3 gearboxes = 18 profiles)*\n- **Pairwise comparisons**:\n  For `P` products with `A` attributes, pairwise comparisons = `P \u00d7 (P-1) / 2`.\n  *(Example: 4 products \u2192 6 comparisons)*\n\n**Data Format for Regression Approach**:\n- Consumer choice data (rankings/ratings).\n- Product attributes (categorical).\n\n---\n\n### **2. Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA)**\n**Purpose**: Measure efficiency of business units (DMUs) with multiple inputs/outputs.\n**Key Concepts**:\n- **Efficiency Score (E)**: `0 \u2264 E \u2264 1` (E=1 = efficient).\n- **Dual Variables (Weights)**: Non-zero weights indicate peer units used for comparison.\n- **Primal/Dual LP**:\n  - Primal maximizes efficiency of a DMU.\n  - Dual minimizes inputs/maximizes outputs with constraints.\n\n**Example**:\nIf `E3 = 1` and others `<1`, **Unit 3 is efficient**.\nIf dual variables for Units 4 and 5 are non-zero, they are peers for Unit 3.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Hypothesis Testing (Chi-Square Tests)**\n#### **A. Chi-Square Test of Independence**\n**Null Hypothesis (H\u2080)**: Variables are independent.\n**Decision Rule**:\n- If `p-value < \u03b1`, reject H\u2080 (variables are **not independent**).\n*(Example: p=0.05, \u03b1=0.1 \u2192 Reject H\u2080)*\n\n#### **B. Chi-Square Goodness-of-Fit Test**\n**Purpose**: Check if data follows a distribution (e.g., uniform, normal).\n**Key Steps**:\n1. Define bins (e.g., 0\u201350, 50\u2013100).\n2. Calculate **expected frequency** = `Total observations / Number of bins`.\n   *(Example: 9 observations \u2192 Expected frequency = 9/6 = 1.5 per bin)*\n3. Compute **Chi-Square statistic**:\n   \\[\n   \\chi^2 = \\sum \\frac{(O_i - E_i)^2}{E_i}\n   \\]\n   *(Example: \u03c7\u00b2 \u2248 3.6 for Product-A sales)*\n4. **Degrees of Freedom (df)** = `Number of bins \u2013 1 \u2013 Number of estimated parameters`.\n   *(Example: Testing normality \u2192 df = 6 \u2013 1 \u2013 2 = 3)*\n\n---\n\n### **4. Linear & Multiple Regression**\n#### **Key Equations**:\n1. **Revenue Maximization**:\n   Given demand `D(p) = 100 \u2013 20p`, revenue `R(p) = D(p) \u00d7 p = (100 \u2013 20p)p`.\n   - Find `p*` by setting derivative to zero:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{dR}{dp} = 100 - 40p = 0 \\implies p* = 2.5\n     \\]\n\n2. **Adjusted R\u00b2**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Adjusted } R^2 = 1 - \\left( \\frac{(1-R^2)(n-1)}{n-k-1} \\right)\n   \\]\n   *(Example: R\u00b2=0.75, n=25, k=3 \u2192 Adjusted R\u00b2 \u2248 0.71)*\n\n3. **Total Effect in Mediation**:\n   - **Direct effect** of X on Y (e.g., price \u2192 sales = 0.3).\n   - **Indirect effects** via mediators (e.g., price \u2192 quantity \u2192 sales = 0.2 \u00d7 0.2 = 0.04; price \u2192 rating \u2192 sales = 0.1 \u00d7 0.4 = 0.04).\n   - **Total effect** = Direct + Indirect = `0.3 + 0.04 + 0.04 = 0.38`.\n\n4. **Variance Inflation Factor (VIF)**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{VIF} = \\frac{1}{1 - R^2_{\\text{aux}}}\n   \\]\n   *(Example: R\u00b2=0.6 for auxiliary regression \u2192 VIF = 2.5)*\n\n---\n\n### **5. Linear Programming (LP) & Duality**\n**Primal LP** (Maximization):\n- Objective: Maximize efficiency.\n- Constraints: Inputs/outputs of DMUs.\n**Dual LP**:\n- Variables correspond to primal constraints.\n- If a primal constraint is **not binding** (slack > 0), its dual variable = **0**.\n\n**Example**:\n- Primal has 2 constraints \u2192 Dual has 2 variables.\n- If Constraint 1 is not binding \u2192 Dual variable for Constraint 1 = 0.\n\n---\n\n### **6. Logistic Regression & Confusion Matrix**\n**Confusion Matrix**:\n|               | Predicted = 1 | Predicted = 0 |\n|---------------|----------------|----------------|\n| **Actual = 1** | True Positive (TP) | False Negative (FN) |\n| **Actual = 0** | False Positive (FP) | True Negative (TN) |\n\n**Metrics**:\n1. **Accuracy** = `(TP + TN) / Total` \u00d7 100.\n   *(Example: (11 + 23) / 156 \u2248 21.79%)*\n2. **Recall (Negative Class)** = `TN / (TN + FP)` \u00d7 100.\n   *(Example: 23 / (23 + 77) \u2248 23.0%)*\n3. **Precision (Positive Class)** = `TP / (TP + FP)` \u00d7 100.\n   *(Example: 11 / (11 + 77) \u2248 12.5%)*\n\n---\n\n### **7. Data Visualization**\n**Best Practices**:\n- **Trends over time**: Line graphs (e.g., sales by year for each city).\n- **Comparisons**: Bar charts (e.g., sales across cities).\n- **Distributions**: Histograms/Q-Q plots (e.g., normality check).\n\n**Example**:\nFor **Product-A sales**:\n- **Key Insight**: City-2 consistently has the lowest sales.\n\n---\n\n### **8. Probability Plots (P-P & Q-Q Plots)**\n- **P-P Plot**: Compares cumulative distributions.\n  - **Normal data**: Points lie on the 45\u00b0 line.\n  - **Right-skewed data**: Points deviate upward at the tail.\n- **Q-Q Plot**: Compares quantiles.\n  - **Normal data**: Points lie on the 45\u00b0 line.\n  - **Non-normal data**: Points deviate (e.g., right tail for skewed data).\n\n---\n\n## **Mermaid Knowledge Graphs**\n### **Graph 1: Business Analytics Core Topics**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Business Analytics] --> B[Conjoint Analysis]\n    A --> C[Data Envelopment Analysis]\n    A --> D[Hypothesis Testing]\n    A --> E[Regression Analysis]\n    A --> F[Linear Programming]\n    A --> G[Logistic Regression]\n    A --> H[Data Visualization]\n\n    B --> B1[Choice-Based]\n    B --> B2[Adaptive-Based]\n    B --> B3[Full-Profile]\n\n    C --> C1[Efficiency Scores]\n    C --> C2[Primal/Dual LP]\n\n    D --> D1[Chi-Square Independence]\n    D --> D2[Goodness-of-Fit]\n\n    E --> E1[Linear Regression]\n    E --> E2[Multiple Regression]\n    E --> E3[Adjusted R\u00b2]\n    E --> E4[VIF]\n\n    F --> F1[Primal LP]\n    F --> F2[Dual LP]\n\n    G --> G1[Confusion Matrix]\n    G --> G2[Accuracy/Precision/Recall]\n\n    H --> H1[Line Graphs]\n    H --> H2[Bar Charts]\n    H --> H3[P-P/Q-Q Plots]\n```\n\n### **Graph 2: Conjoint Analysis Workflow**\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n    A[Define Attributes] --> B[Create Profiles]\n    B --> C[Consumer Rankings]\n    C --> D[Regression Model]\n    D --> E[Attribute Importance]\n    D --> F[Market Simulation]\n```\n\n### **Graph 3: Hypothesis Testing Decision Tree**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Chi-Square Test] --> B[Test Type?]\n    B -->|Independence| C[Compare p-value to \u03b1]\n    B -->|Goodness-of-Fit| D[Calculate \u03c7\u00b2 Statistic]\n    C -->|p < \u03b1| E[Reject H\u2080]\n    C -->|p \u2265 \u03b1| F[Fail to Reject H\u2080]\n    D --> G[Compare \u03c7\u00b2 to Critical Value]\n    G -->|\u03c7\u00b2 > Critical| E\n    G -->|\u03c7\u00b2 \u2264 Critical| F\n```\n\n### **Graph 4: Regression Analysis Relationships**\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n    A[Dependent Variable] -->|Influenced By| B[Independent Variables]\n    B --> C[Direct Effects]\n    B --> D[Indirect Effects]\n    C --> E[Coefficients]\n    D --> F[Mediation Analysis]\n    E --> G[Total Effect]\n    F --> G\n```\n\n### **Graph 5: DEA Efficiency Evaluation**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Input Data] --> B[Primal LP]\n    B --> C[Efficiency Scores]\n    C -->|E=1| D[Efficient DMU]\n    C -->|E<1| E[Inefficient DMU]\n    E --> F[Peer Benchmarking]\n    F --> G[Dual LP Weights]\n```",
