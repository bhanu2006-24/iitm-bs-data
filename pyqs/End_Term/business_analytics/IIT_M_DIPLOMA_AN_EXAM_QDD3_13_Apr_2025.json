However, the \u201cTop\u201d and \u201cElectronic Cartridge\u201d are different for the two calculators. All components can be manufactured by MCS or can be purchased from outside suppliers. The cost for manufacturing a component and the cost for component purchase (referred to as purchase cost) from a supplier is presented in Table-4. \n  MCS has planned to make 3000 Financial Calculators and 2000 Technical Calculators. However, manufacturing capacity is limited.
