Core Topics & Concepts**\n### **A. Statistical Methods**\n#### **1. Hypothesis Testing**\n- **Chi-Square Test of Independence**\n  - **Purpose**: Test if two categorical variables are independent.\n  - **Hypotheses**:\n    - \\( H_0 \\): Variables are independent.\n    - \\( H_1 \\): Variables are **not** independent.\n  - **Decision Rule**:\n    - If \\( p\\text{-value} < \\alpha \\), **reject \\( H_0 \\)** (variables are dependent).\n    - Else, **fail to reject \\( H_0 \\)**.\n  - **Example (Q3)**:\n    - \\( \\alpha = 0.1 \\), \\( p\\text{-value} = 0.05 \\).\n    - **Conclusion**: Reject \\( H_0 \\) (variables are **not independent**).\n\n- **Chi-Square Goodness-of-Fit Test**\n  - **Purpose**: Test if data follows a specified distribution (e.g., uniform, normal).\n  - **Test Statistic**:\n    \\[\n    \\chi^2 = \\sum \\frac{(O_i - E_i)^2}{E_i}\n    \\]\n    where \\( O_i \\) = observed frequency, \\( E_i \\) = expected frequency.\n  - **Degrees of Freedom (df)**:\n    - For uniform distribution: \\( df = \\text{number of bins} - 1 - \\text{estimated parameters} \\).\n    - **Example (Q21)**: If testing normality with 6 bins, \\( df = 6 - 1 - 2 = 3 \\) (mean & variance estimated).\n\n#### **2. Normality Tests**\n- **Q-Q Plot vs. P-P Plot**\n  - **Q-Q Plot**: Compares quantiles of data to a theoretical distribution (e.g., normal).\n    - If data is normal, points lie on a **45-degree line**.\n    - **Right-skewed data**: Points deviate upward at the tail (Q3 > expected).\n  - **P-P Plot**: Compares cumulative probabilities.\n    - If data is normal, points lie on a **45-degree line**.\n    - **Non-normal data**: Points deviate from the line.\n  - **Example (Q8)**:\n    - Right-tailed normal vs. symmetric normal:\n      - **Q-Q Plot**: Points **do not** lie on the 45-degree line (due to skewness).\n      - **P-P Plot**: Points **do not** lie on the 45-degree line.\n\n---\n\n### **B. Conjoint Analysis**\n#### **1. Purpose**\n- Determines **relative importance** of product attributes (e.g., price, features) in consumer decision-making.\n\n#### **2. Types of Conjoint Analysis**\n| Type               | Description                                                                 |\n|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Choice-Based**   | Consumers choose among product profiles.                                    |\n| **Adaptive**       | Attributes/adjust based on consumer responses.                            |\n| **Full Profile**   | Consumers evaluate complete product profiles.                              |\n| **Menu-Based**     | Consumers select bundles of attributes.                                     |\n| **Selective Attribute** | **Not a valid type** (Q5).                                  |\n\n#### **3. Design & Calculations**\n- **Number of Pairwise Comparisons**:\n  - For \\( n \\) products, comparisons = \\( \\binom{n}{2} = \\frac{n(n-1)}{2} \\).\n  - **Example (Q6)**: 4 products \u2192 \\( \\binom{4}{2} = 6 \\) comparisons.\n- **Total Profiles to Rate**:\n  - If attributes have levels \\( a, b, c \\), total profiles = \\( a \\times b \\times c \\).\n  - **Example (Q7)**: 3 brands \u00d7 2 engines \u00d7 3 gearboxes = **18 profiles**.\n\n#### **4. Data Requirements for Regression-Based Conjoint**\n- **Input Data**:\n  - Consumer **rankings** or **ratings** of product profiles (Q10).\n  - Product attributes can be **categorical** (e.g., LED lights: Yes/No).\n\n---\n\n### **C. Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA)**\n#### **1. Purpose**\n- Measures **relative efficiency** of decision-making units (DMUs) (e.g., business units, stores).\n- **Efficiency Score (E)**:\n  - \\( E = 1 \\): **Efficient** (best practice).\n  - \\( E < 1 \\): **Inefficient**.\n\n#### **2. Key Concepts**\n- **Primal Problem**: Maximize efficiency for a DMU.\n- **Dual Problem**: Derives **peer weights** (benchmarks).\n- **Binding Constraints**:\n  - If a constraint is **not binding** (slack exists), its dual variable = **0** (Q14).\n- **Efficiency Interpretation**:\n  - **Example (Q4)**: \\( E_3 = 1 \\) \u2192 **Efficient**; others (\\( E < 1 \\)) are inefficient.\n  - **Example (Q9)**:\n    - If DMU 5\u2019s optimal weights yield \\( E_3 = 0.8 \\) and \\( E_7 = 0.9 \\), then:\n      - DMU 3 **may be inefficient** (since \\( E_3 < 1 \\)).\n      - DMU 7 **may be inefficient** (since \\( E_7 < 1 \\)).\n\n#### **3. Calculating Efficiency**\n- **Example (Q15)**:\n  - Given:\n    - DMU 3\u2019s efficiency = 0.7.\n    - Dual variables for DMU 4 and DMU 5 are **non-zero** (0.3 and 0.4).\n    - Outputs: Sales, Leads.\n  - **Virtual Output** for DMU 3:\n    \\[\n    \\text{Virtual Sales} = 0.3 \\times \\text{Sales}_4 + 0.4 \\times \\text{Sales}_5 = 0.3 \\times 8500 + 0.4 \\times 8200 = 8330\n    \\]\n    - Since efficiency = 0.7, actual sales = \\( 0.7 \\times 8330 \\approx 5831 \\).\n    - **But the question asks for the \"sales in HCU 3\" (likely the virtual output)**: **8330** (closest to 8325\u20138335).\n\n---\n\n### **D.
