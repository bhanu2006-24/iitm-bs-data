Data Visualization**\n- **Key Concepts**:\n  - **Bar Charts vs. Stacked Bar Charts**:\n    - Use **grouped/stacked bar charts** to compare proportions across categories (e.g., gender vs. difficulty levels).\n  - **Pie Charts**: Avoid for comparative analysis (used in Image C, which is incorrect for proportional comparison).\n  - **Line Charts**: For trends over time (not relevant here).\n  - **Tables**: Raw data representation (Image B is incorrect due to misaligned values).\n\n- **When to Use What**:\n  | Goal                          | Best Visualization          |\n  |-------------------------------|------------------------------|\n  | Compare proportions by group  | **Stacked/Grouped Bar Chart** |\n  | Show exact values             | **Table**                    |\n  | Avoid for comparisons         | **Pie Chart**                |\n\n---\n\n### **2.
