The summary is organized by topic, followed by a **Mermaid knowledge graph** to visualize relationships.\n\n---\n\n---\n\n## **1. Probability Distributions & Statistical Tests**\n### **Key Concepts:**\n- **Symmetric vs. Asymmetric Distributions**:\n  - Symmetric: Normal, Uniform, Standard Normal.\n  - Asymmetric: Poisson, Binomial (unless p=0.5).\n- **Empirical Distribution**:\n  - Built using **sample data**, **PDF/PMF**, or **summary statistics**.\n- **Poisson Distribution**:\n  - Used for count data (e.g., defects).\n  - **Test for Poisson Fit**: Chi-square goodness-of-fit test.\n    - **Test Statistic**:\n      \\[\n      \\chi^2 = \\sum \\frac{(O_i - E_i)^2}{E_i}\n      \\]\n      where \\(O_i\\) = observed frequency, \\(E_i\\) = expected frequency (Poisson).\n    - **Degrees of Freedom (df)** = Number of bins - 1 - Number of estimated parameters.\n    - **Decision Rule**: Reject \\(H_0\\) (Poisson fit) if \\(\\chi^2 > \\chi^2_{\\alpha, df}\\).\n\n### **Equations:**\n- **Poisson PMF**:\n  \\[\n  P(X = k) = \\frac{e^{-\\lambda} \\lambda^k}{k!}, \\quad k = 0, 1, 2, \\dots\n  \\]\n- **Chi-Square Critical Value**: Refer to chi-square table (e.g., \\(\\chi^2_{0.05, 4} = 9.49\\)).\n\n---\n\n## **2. Hypothesis Testing**\n### **Key Concepts:**\n- **Null Hypothesis (\\(H_0\\))**: Assumes data follows a distribution (e.g., Poisson).\n- **Alternative Hypothesis (\\(H_1\\))**: Assumes data does **not** follow the distribution.\n- **Decision Rules**:\n  - If test statistic > critical value \u2192 **Reject \\(H_0\\)**.\n  - Else \u2192 **Fail to reject \\(H_0\\)**.\n\n### **Example (Q4):**\n- **Conclusion**: Reject \\(H_0\\) \u2192 Defects **do not follow** Poisson.\n\n---\n\n## **3. Linear Regression & Demand Modeling**\n### **Key Concepts:**\n- **Demand Function**:\n  \\[\n  D(P) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 P + \\epsilon\n  \\]\n  where \\(D\\) = demand, \\(P\\) = price, \\(\\epsilon\\) = error.\n- **Elasticity of Demand**:\n  \\[\n  E_d = \\frac{dD}{dP} \\cdot \\frac{P}{D} = \\beta_1 \\cdot \\frac{P}{D}\n  \\]\n  - \\(|E_d| > 1\\) \u2192 Elastic.\n  - \\(|E_d| < 1\\) \u2192 Inelastic.\n- **Market Size**: Intercept (\\(\\beta_0\\)) of the demand equation.\n- **Satiating Price**: Price where \\(D(P) = 0\\):\n  \\[\n  P_{\\text{satiating}} = -\\frac{\\beta_0}{\\beta_1}\n  \\]\n- **Profit Maximization**:\n  - **Profit (\\(\\pi\\))**:\n    \\[\n    \\pi = (P - C) \\cdot D(P)\n    \\]\n    where \\(C\\) = cost per unit.\n  - **Optimal Price**: Solve \\(\\frac{d\\pi}{dP} = 0\\).\n\n### **Equations (Q10-Q14, Q23-Q24):**\n- **Demand Equation (Given)**:\n  \\[\n  D(P) = 39942 - 29.5P\n  \\]\n- **Elasticity at \\(P = 50\\)**:\n  \\[\n  E_d = -29.5 \\cdot \\frac{50}{D(50)} \\approx -0.04 \\quad (\\text{Inelastic})\n  \\]\n- **Satiating Price**:\n  \\[\n  P = \\frac{39942}{29.5} \\approx 1354.00\n  \\]\n- **Market Size**: \\(\\beta_0 = 39942\\).\n- **R-Squared (\\(R^2\\))**:\n  \\[\n  R^2 = \\frac{SS_{\\text{Regression}}}{SS_{\\text{Total}}} = \\frac{7076613}{7184891} \\approx 0.985 \\quad (98.50\\%)\n  \\]\n- **Profit Maximization (Q23-Q24)**:\n  - **Demand**: \\(D(P) = 780 - 9P\\).\n  - **Cost**: \\(C = 30\\) per unit.\n  - **Profit**:\n    \\[\n    \\pi = (P - 30)(780 - 9P)\n    \\]\n  - **Optimal Price**: Solve \\(\\frac{d\\pi}{dP} = 0\\) \u2192 \\(P = 59\\).\n  - **Max Profit**: \\(\\pi(59) \\approx 20424.50\\).\n\n---\n\n## **4. Conjoint Analysis**\n### **Key Concepts:**\n- **Part-Worth Utilities**: Utility contributed by each attribute level.\n- **Pairwise Comparison**: Used when attributes are continuous.\n  - **Approach**: Optimization (e.g., linear programming).\n- **Customer Preference**: Choose product with **shortest Euclidean distance** to ideal point.\n\n### **Equations (Q5-Q7):**\n- **Distance Metric**:\n  \\[\n  d = \\sqrt{(x_1 - o_{1})^2 + (x_2 - o_{2})^2}\n  \\]\n  where \\(x\\) = ideal point, \\(o\\) = product coordinates.\n- **Preference Rule**: Prefer product with smaller \\(d\\).\n\n---\n\n## **5.
