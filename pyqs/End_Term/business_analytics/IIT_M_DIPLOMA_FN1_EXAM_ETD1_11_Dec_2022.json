Core Topics & Key Concepts**\n### **A. Descriptive Statistics & Data Types**\n- **Discrete vs. Continuous Data**:\n  - Discrete: Countable (e.g., number of courses, batch size).\n  - Continuous: Measurable (e.g., average weight, average age).\n- **Measures of Central Tendency & Dispersion**:\n  - Mean, Median, Mode, Variance, Range.\n- **Skewness**:\n  - **Right-tailed (Positive Skew)**: Mean > Median > Mode.\n  - **Left-tailed (Negative Skew)**: Mean < Median < Mode.\n  - **Symmetric**: Mean = Median = Mode.\n\n### **B. Hypothesis Testing**\n- **p-value vs. Significance Level (\u03b1)**:\n  - If **p-value \u2264 \u03b1**: Reject \\( H_0 \\).\n  - If **p-value > \u03b1**: Fail to reject \\( H_0 \\).\n- **Chi-Squared Tests**:\n  - **Goodness of Fit**: Tests if observed frequencies match expected frequencies (uniform distribution).\n  - **Test of Independence**: Tests if two categorical variables are independent.\n  - **Test Statistic**:\n    \\[\n    \\chi^2 = \\sum \\frac{(O_i - E_i)^2}{E_i}\n    \\]\n  - **Degrees of Freedom (df)**:\n    - Goodness of Fit: \\( df = k - 1 \\) (where \\( k \\) = categories).\n    - Independence: \\( df = (r-1)(c-1) \\) (where \\( r \\) = rows, \\( c \\) = columns).\n\n### **C. Regression Analysis**\n- **Simple & Multiple Linear Regression**:\n  - **R-squared (\\( R^2 \\))**: Proportion of variance explained by the model.\n  - **Adjusted \\( R^2 \\)** (for multiple regression):\n    \\[\n    \\text{Adjusted } R^2 = 1 - \\left( \\frac{(1-R^2)(n-1)}{n-p-1} \\right)\n    \\]\n    where \\( n \\) = sample size, \\( p \\) = number of predictors.\n  - **Collinearity & Multicollinearity**:\n    - **Variance Inflation Factor (VIF)**:\n      - VIF > 10: High multicollinearity.\n      - VIF < 1: **Calculation error** (theoretically impossible).\n    - **Effects**: Unstable coefficient estimates, inflated standard errors.\n  - **Partial vs. Marginal Slopes**:\n    - **Partial Slope**: Effect of \\( X_i \\) on \\( Y \\) holding other variables constant.\n    - **Marginal Slope**: Effect of \\( X_i \\) on \\( Y \\) ignoring other variables.\n    - **They coincide only if predictors are uncorrelated (independent).**\n\n- **Logistic Regression**:\n  - Used for **binary classification**.\n  - **Non-linear decision boundary** possible via transformations (e.g., polynomial features).\n\n### **D.
