Regression Analysis**\n#### **Core Concepts:**\n- **Marginal vs. Partial Slopes**:\n  - **Marginal slope**: Change in dependent variable (Y) for a unit change in an independent variable (X), **holding all other variables constant** (only possible if X\u2019s are independent).\n  - **Partial slope**: Change in Y for a unit change in X, **accounting for correlations** between X\u2019s (used in multiple regression).\n  - **Key Point**: Marginal and partial slopes **coincide only if explanatory variables are independent** (Q2: FALSE).\n\n- **R-Squared vs. Adjusted R-Squared**:\n  - **R\u00b2**: Proportion of variance in Y explained by X\u2019s. Always increases with more variables (even irrelevant ones).\n  - **Adjusted R\u00b2**: Penalizes unnecessary variables. Formula:\n    \\[\n    \\text{Adjusted } R^2 = 1 - \\left( \\frac{(1-R^2)(n-1)}{n-p-1} \\right)\n    \\]\n    where \\( n \\) = observations, \\( p \\) = predictors.\n  - **Interpretation**: If Adjusted R\u00b2 > R\u00b2, it\u2019s a **calculation error** (Adjusted R\u00b2 \u2264 R\u00b2 always) (Q4: C).\n\n---\n\n#### **Key Equations:**\n1. **Simple Linear Regression**:\n   \\[\n   Y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X + \\epsilon\n   \\]\n2. **Multiple Linear Regression**:\n   \\[\n   Y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_1 + \\beta_2 X_2 + ... + \\beta_p X_p + \\epsilon\n   \\]\n3. **R-Squared**:\n   \\[\n   R^2 = 1 - \\frac{\\text{SS}_{\\text{res}}}{\\text{SS}_{\\text{tot}}}\n   \\]\n   where \\( \\text{SS}_{\\text{res}} \\) = residual sum of squares, \\( \\text{SS}_{\\text{tot}} \\) = total sum of squares.\n\n---\n\n### **2.
