        "summary": "Here\u2019s a structured **summary of core topics, concepts, principles, and equations** essential for the **Diploma in Business Analytics (Computer-Based Exam)**, along with **Mermaid knowledge graphs** to visualize relationships.\n\n---\n\n## **1. Probability & Conditional Probability**\n### **Core Concepts**\n- **Conditional Probability**: \\( P(A|B) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)} \\)\n- **Bayes' Theorem**: \\( P(A|B) = \\frac{P(B|A) \\cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \\)\n- **Independent Events**: \\( P(A \\cap B) = P(A) \\cdot P(B) \\)\n\n### **Key Problem (Q2)**\n- **Scenario**: Two factories (A, B) produce radios with defect probabilities \\( P(D|A) = 0.05 \\), \\( P(D|B) = 0.1 \\). Prior probability \\( P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 \\).\n- **Question**: If the first radio is defective, what is the probability the second radio is also defective?\n- **Solution**:\n  - Use **Law of Total Probability** to find \\( P(D) \\):\n    \\[\n    P(D) = P(D|A) \\cdot P(A) + P(D|B) \\cdot P(B) = 0.05 \\times 0.5 + 0.1 \\times 0.5 = 0.075\n    \\]\n  - Apply **Bayes' Theorem** to find \\( P(A|D) \\) and \\( P(B|D) \\):\n    \\[\n    P(A|D) = \\frac{0.05 \\times 0.5}{0.075} = \\frac{1}{3}, \\quad P(B|D) = \\frac{0.1 \\times 0.5}{0.075} = \\frac{2}{3}\n    \\]\n  - The probability the second radio is defective:\n    \\[\n    P(D_2|D_1) = P(D|A) \\cdot P(A|D) + P(D|B) \\cdot P(B|D) = 0.05 \\times \\frac{1}{3} + 0.1 \\times \\frac{2}{3} = 0.0833 \\approx 0.08\n    \\]\n  - **Answer**: `0.08` (Note: The expected answer range was 0.04\u20130.05, but the correct calculation yields ~0.08. Verify assumptions.)\n\n---\n\n## **2. Linear Programming (LP) & Optimization**\n### **Core Concepts**\n- **Decision Variables**: Variables to optimize (e.g., number of interviews).\n- **Objective Function**: Minimize/maximize (e.g., cost minimization).\n- **Constraints**: Inequalities/equalities (e.g., quota guidelines).\n- **Dual Problem**: Maximization problem derived from the primal (minimization) LP.\n\n### **Key Problems (Q3\u2013Q6, Q16\u2013Q18, Q21\u2013Q23)**\n#### **MSS Survey Problem (Q3\u2013Q6)**\n- **Decision Variables**: 4 (day/evening interviews for households with/without children).\n- **Constraints (7)**:\n  1. Total interviews: \\( x_{11} + x_{12} + x_{21} + x_{22} = 1000 \\)\n  2. Households with children: \\( x_{11} + x_{12} \\geq 400 \\)\n  3. Households without children: \\( x_{21} + x_{22} \\geq 400 \\)\n  4. Evening interviews \u2265 daytime: \\( x_{12} + x_{22} \\geq x_{11} + x_{21} \\)\n  5. 40% of children interviews in evening: \\( x_{12} \\geq 0.4(x_{11} + x_{12}) \\)\n  6. 60% of non-children interviews in evening: \\( x_{22} \\geq 0.6(x_{21} + x_{22}) \\)\n  7. Non-negativity: \\( x_{ij} \\geq 0 \\)\n- **Objective**: Minimize cost \\( 20x_{11} + 25x_{12} + 18x_{21} + 20x_{22} \\).\n- **Dual Variables**: Non-zero for binding constraints (Q6: 2 non-zero dual variables).\n\n#### **DEA (Data Envelopment Analysis) (Q16\u2013Q18, Q21\u2013Q23)**\n- **Efficiency Frontier**: Identifies efficient DMUs (Decision-Making Units).\n- **Primal LP for Sales Office 3**:\n  - **Objective**: Maximize efficiency \\( \\theta \\).\n  - **Constraints**:\n    - Input constraints: \\( 600,000 \\lambda_1 + \\ldots + 285,000 \\lambda_5 \\leq 600,000 \\theta \\)\n    - Output constraint: \\( 20,000,000 \\lambda_1 + \\ldots + 20,000,000 \\lambda_5 \\geq 20,000,000 \\)\n    - \\( \\lambda_i \\geq 0 \\)\n  - **Type Constraint (Q17)**: \\( 600,000 y_1 + 8 y_2 = 1 \\) (normalization).\n  - **Non-Constraint (Q18)**: The constraint for Sales Office 3 itself is not needed in the dual.\n\n---\n\n## **3. Hypothesis Testing (Chi-Square & Normality)**\n### **Core Concepts**\n- **Chi-Square Test for Independence**:\n  - Expected frequency: \\( E_{ij} = \\frac{(\\text{Row Total}) \\times (\\text{Column Total})}{\\text{Grand Total}} \\)\n  - Test statistic: \\( \\chi^2 = \\sum \\frac{(O_{ij} - E_{ij})^2}{E_{ij}} \\)\n- **Goodness-of-Fit Test (Normality)**:\n  - Compare observed vs. expected frequencies under normal distribution.\n  - Degrees of freedom: \\( k - 1 - \\text{parameters estimated} \\) (Q11: 2).\n\n### **Key Problems (Q7\u2013Q11)**\n- **Q7\u2013Q8**: Expected counts for male/female responses (e.g., rating \"3\" or \"5\").\n  - Example for Q7 (rating \"3\"):\n    \\[\n    E_{\\text{male,3}} = \\frac{(\\text{Total Male}) \\times (\\text{Total Rating 3})}{\\text{Grand Total}} = \\frac{100 \\times 35}{200} = 17.5\n    \\]\n- **Q9**: Chi-square statistic for independence (~14.75).\n- **Q10**: Goodness-of-fit test statistic (~21.5).\n- **Q11**: Degrees of freedom = 5 (categories) - 1 - 2 (mean, variance) = 2.\n\n---\n\n## **4. Regression & Multicollinearity**\n### **Core Concepts**\n- **Coefficient of Determination (\\( R^2 \\))**: Percentage of variance explained by the model.\n  \\[\n  R^2 = r_{BP,Age}^2 = 0.695^2 \\approx 0.483 \\quad (\\text{Q12: 48.30%})\n  \\]\n- **Variance Inflation Factor (VIF)**: Measures multicollinearity.\n  \\[\n  \\text{VIF} = \\frac{1}{1 - R^2_{\\text{Age} \\sim \\text{Weight}}} = \\frac{1}{1 - 0.507^2} \\approx 1.34 \\quad (\\text{Q13: 1.34})\n  \\]\n\n---\n\n## **5. Logistic Regression & Classification Metrics**\n### **Core Concepts**\n- **Logistic Regression Model**:\n  \\[\n  P(Y=1) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_1 + \\beta_2 X_2)}}\n  \\]\n- **Classification Metrics**:\n  - **Accuracy**: \\( \\frac{TP + TN}{TP + TN + FP + FN} \\)\n  - **Precision (Class 1)**: \\( \\frac{TP}{TP + FP} \\)\n  - **Sensitivity (Recall)**: \\( \\frac{TP}{TP + FN} \\)\n  - **Specificity**: \\( \\frac{TN}{TN + FP} \\)\n\n### **Key Problems (Q14\u2013Q15, Q24\u2013Q28)**\n- **Q14\u2013Q15**: Confusion matrix for animal classification.\n  - **Accuracy**: \\( \\frac{5 + 5 + 4}{30} \\approx 46.67\\% \\)\n  - **Precision (Dog)**: \\( \\frac{5}{2 + 2 + 5} \\approx 55.56\\% \\)\n- **Q24\u2013Q28**: Bike loan logistic regression.\n  - **Predictions**: Apply threshold \\( P(Y=1) \\geq 0.35 \\).\n  - **Metrics**:\n    - Accuracy: 33.33% (Q24)\n    - Precision (Class 1): 25% (Q25)\n    - Sensitivity: 50% (Q26)\n    - Specificity: 25% (Q28)\n\n---\n\n## **6. Conjoint Analysis**\n### **Core Concepts**\n- **Approaches**:\n  - **Statistical/Regression**: Requires rating data (Q29: A, D).\n  - **Optimization**: For pairwise comparisons (Q31: A).\n- **Pairwise Comparisons**: For 4 products, \\( \\binom{4}{2} = 6 \\) pairs (Q32: D).\n\n---\n\n## **7.
