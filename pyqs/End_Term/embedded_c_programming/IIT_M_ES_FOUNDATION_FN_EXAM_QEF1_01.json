        "summary": "Here\u2019s a structured **summary of core topics, concepts, and equations** for the **Embedded C Programming** exam, followed by **Mermaid knowledge graphs** to visualize relationships.\n\n---\n\n### **Core Topics & Concepts**\n#### **1. Microcontrollers (MCUs) vs. Microprocessors (MPUs)**\n- **MCUs**: Used for **dedicated, low-power tasks** (e.g., sensor monitoring, IoT devices).\n  - Features: Integrated memory, peripherals (ADC, timers, UART), low cost.\n  - Example: **Temperature/humidity monitoring (Q2)**.\n- **MPUs**: Used for **high-performance computing** (e.g., servers, PCs).\n  - Features: External memory, higher clock speeds, no built-in peripherals.\n\n#### **2. Embedded Programming Languages**\n- **C**: Dominant for embedded systems (low-level control, efficiency).\n- **C++**: Object-oriented extension of C (modularity, classes, templates).\n  - Used when **abstraction** or **code reuse** is critical (Q3).\n- **Assembly**: For **performance-critical** or **hardware-specific** operations (Q10).\n- **Rust**: Emerging for safety-critical systems (memory safety, no garbage collection).\n\n#### **3. Data Types & Memory Efficiency**\n- **Key Data Types in Embedded C**:\n  - `uint8_t`: 8-bit unsigned integer (0\u2013255). **Most efficient for values \u2264 100 (Q4)**.\n  - `uint16_t`: 16-bit unsigned integer (0\u201365,535).\n  - `int`: Typically 16/32 bits (platform-dependent).\n- **Memory Optimization**:\n  - Use the **smallest data type** that fits the range.\n  - Avoid `int` if `uint8_t` suffices (saves RAM/Flash).\n\n#### **4. Analog-to-Digital Conversion (ADC)**\n- **Resolution**: Number of distinct levels an ADC can represent.\n  - **10-bit ADC**: \\(2^{10} = 1024\\) levels.\n  - **12-bit ADC**: \\(2^{12} = 4096\\) levels (Q24).\n- **Voltage Resolution**:\n  - Formula: \\(\\text{Resolution (V)} = \\frac{V_{ref}}{2^n}\\)\n    - \\(V_{ref}\\): Reference voltage (e.g., 3.3V).\n    - \\(n\\): Bit depth (e.g., 10 bits).\n  - Example (Q5): For 10-bit ADC, \\(V_{ref} = 3.3V\\):\n    \\[\n    \\text{Resolution} = \\frac{3.3}{1024} \\approx 3.22 \\, \\text{mV}\n    \\]\n\n#### **5. Wireless Communication Protocols**\n| Protocol  | Range       | Power Usage | Use Case                          |\n|-----------|-------------|-------------|-----------------------------------|\n| **Zigbee** (Q6) | 10\u2013100m     | Low         | Home automation, sensor networks  |\n| WiFi      | 50\u2013100m     | High        | High-speed data (e.g., streaming) |\n| LoRa      | 1\u201310km      | Very Low    | Long-range IoT (e.g., agriculture)|\n| LTE       | Cellular    | High        | Mobile broadband                  |\n\n- **Scalability (Q7)**: A protocol\u2019s ability to **handle more devices efficiently** (e.g., Zigbee supports mesh networks).\n\n#### **6. Code Optimization Techniques**\n- **Loop Unrolling (Q8)**:\n  - **What it does**: Reduces loop overhead by **expanding iterations manually**.\n  - Example:\n    ```c\n    // Original loop\n    for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) { sum += array[i]; }\n\n    // Unrolled loop\n    sum += array[0]; sum += array[1]; sum += array[2]; sum += array[3];\n    ```\n  - **Benefit**: Fewer branch instructions \u2192 faster execution.\n\n- **DMA (Direct Memory Access) (Q14)**:\n  - **Purpose**: Offloads **data transfers** from CPU to peripherals (e.g., ADC \u2192 RAM).\n  - **Use Case**: Real-time audio processing (48 kHz sampling).\n    - DMA transfers data **without CPU intervention**, reducing latency.\n\n#### **7. Power Management**\n- **Power Consumption Formula (Q9)**:\n  \\[\n  P = V \\times I\n  \\]\n  - \\(P\\): Power (Watts).\n  - \\(V\\): Voltage (constant in the question).\n  - \\(I\\): Current (key factor when \\(V\\) is fixed).\n- **Leakage Current Reduction (Q15)**:\n  - **Sleep Modes**: Disable unused peripherals/components.\n  - **Dynamic Voltage Scaling (DVS)**: Reduce \\(V\\) when possible.\n  - **Clock Gating**: Turn off clocks to idle modules.\n\n#### **8. Assembly Language Basics (Q10)**\n- **Registers**: Temporary storage (e.g., AX, DX, BX in x86).\n- **Key Instructions**:\n  - `MOV`: Copy data (e.g., `MOV AX, 15`).\n  - `ADD/SUB`: Arithmetic (e.g., `ADD AX, DX`).\n  - `JMP/CALL`: Control flow.\n- **Example Execution**:\n  ```assembly\n  MOV AX, 15    ; AX = 15\n  MOV DX, 25    ; DX = 25\n  ADD AX, DX    ; AX = 15 + 25 = 40\n  SUB DX, 10    ; DX = 25 - 10 = 15\n  ```\n  Final: **AX = 40, DX = 15**.\n\n#### **9. Device Drivers (Q11)**\n- **Purpose**: Provide an **abstraction layer** between hardware and software.\n  - Example: A **UART driver** hides register-level details for serial communication.\n- **Key Functions**:\n  - Initialize hardware.\n  - Handle interrupts (e.g., data received).\n  - Provide APIs (e.g., `UART_write()`).\n\n#### **10. Error Handling & Debugging**\n- **Assertions (Q12)**:\n  - **Purpose**: Catch **logical errors** during development.\n  - Example:\n    ```c\n    assert(x > 0); // Crashes if x \u2264 0 (debug-only).\n    ```\n- **Real-Time Debugging (Q16)**:\n  - **Tools**:\n    - **RTOS Debuggers**: Trace task execution (e.g., FreeRTOS + Tracealyzer).\n    - **Logic Analyzers**: Capture timing signals.\n  - **Avoid**: `printf` (adds latency) or manual delays (unreliable).\n\n#### **11. Static Analysis (Q17)**\n- **What it does**: Analyzes code **without execution** to find bugs.\n  - **Common Checks**:\n    - Memory leaks (e.g., `malloc` without `free`).\n    - Buffer overflows.\n    - Dead code.\n  - **When to Use**: **Early in development** (before compilation).\n\n#### **12. Memory Mapping**\n- **SRAM Addressing (Q20)**:\n  - **Given**: 512KB SRAM starting at `0x00200000`.\n  - **Last Byte Address**:\n    \\[\n    \\text{Start} + \\text{Size} - 1 = 0x00200000 + 0x80000 - 1 = 0x0027FFFF\n    \\]\n- **Peripheral Registers (Q21)**:\n  - **Given**: 32-bit registers starting at `0xABCDEF00`, 10 registers.\n  - **6th Register Offset**: \\(5 \\times 4 = 20\\) bytes (`0x14`).\n  - **Address**: `0xABCDEF00 + 0x14 = 0xABCDEF14`.\n\n#### **13. Finite State Machines (FSM) (Q22)**\n- **Components**:\n  - **States**: e.g., `STATE_OFF`, `STATE_ON`.\n  - **Events**: e.g., `EVENT_BUTTON_PRESS`.\n  - **Transitions**: State changes based on events.\n- **Example (LED Control)**:\n  ```\n  STATE_ON --(Button Press)--> STATE_BLINKING --(Button Press)--> STATE_OFF\n  ```\n- **Key Rule**: Always handle **unexpected states** (e.g., `default` case).\n\n#### **14. Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS)**\n- **FreeRTOS Basics (Q23)**:\n  - **Tasks**: Independent threads (e.g., `Task1`, `Task2`).\n  - **Scheduler**: Switches tasks based on priority.\n  - **Critical Function**: `vTaskStartScheduler()` **must be called** to start multitasking.\n- **Task States**:\n  - **Running**, **Ready**, **Blocked** (e.g., by `vTaskDelay`), **Suspended**.\n\n#### **15. Bitwise Operations (Q19)**\n- **Bit Masking**: Check/set/clear specific bits.\n  - **Example**: Check if the 5th bit (0-indexed from right) is set in byte `y`:\n    ```c\n    if (y & 0x10) { /* Bit is set */ }\n    ```\n  - **Mask Calculation**: \\(2^{\\text{bit position}} = 2^4 = 16\\) (`0x10`).\n\n#### **16. Ethics in Embedded Systems (Q18)**\n- **Ethics of Care**:\n  - Focus on **relationships** and **responsiveness** to stakeholders.\n  - Contrast with:\n    - **Utilitarianism** (maximize happiness).\n    - **Deontology** (follow rules).\n\n---\n\n### **Mermaid Knowledge Graphs**\n#### **1.
