        "summary": "Here\u2019s a structured **summary of core topics, concepts, principles, and equations** for the **Business Data Management (Computer-Based Exam)** based on the question paper.\nThe exam covers **business analytics, data-driven decision-making, Excel functions, financial metrics, A/B testing, and operational efficiency**.\n\n---\n\n---\n\n### **1. Core Topics & Concepts**\n#### **A. Economics & Business Fundamentals**\n1. **Law of Demand**\n   - **Concept**: Inverse relationship between price and quantity demanded (all else equal).\n   - **Equation**:\n     \\[\n     Q_d = f(P^{-1}, \\text{other factors})\n     \\]\n     Where \\(Q_d\\) = Quantity Demanded, \\(P\\) = Price.\n\n2. **Types of Goods**\n   - **Normal Goods**: Demand \u2191 when income \u2191 (e.g., smartphones).\n   - **Inferior Goods**: Demand \u2193 when income \u2191 (e.g., generic brands).\n   - **Luxury Goods**: High income elasticity (demand \u2191 more than proportionally with income).\n\n3. **Market Potential**\n   - **Key Factors**:\n     - Size of target market.\n     - % of potential customers interested.\n   - **Equation**:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Market Potential} = \\text{Target Market Size} \\times \\text{% Interested}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Revenue & Profit Calculations**\n   - **Total Revenue (TR)**:\n     \\[\n     TR = \\text{Price per Unit} \\times \\text{Quantity Sold}\n     \\]\n   - **Profit**:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Profit} = \\text{Revenue} - \\text{Costs} - \\text{Losses (e.g., defaults)}\n     \\]\n   - **Example (Q11)**:\n     - Transaction fee = 3.5% of transaction amount.\n     - Interest on credit = 18% p.a. (if paid back).\n     - Loss if defaulted.\n\n5. **Percentage Change in Revenue**\n   - **Formula**:\n     \\[\n     \\% \\text{ Change} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{New Revenue} - \\text{Old Revenue}}{\\text{Old Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100\n     \\]\n   - **Example (Q14)**:\n     - Income \u2191 from Rs 15,000 \u2192 Rs 25,000.\n     - Quantity demanded \u2191 from 60 \u2192 90 units.\n     - Price \u2193 from Rs 40 \u2192 Rs 38.\n\n---\n\n#### **B. Data Analysis & Excel Functions**\n1. **Excel Functions**\n   - **COUNTIF**: Counts cells meeting a condition.\n     ```excel\n     =COUNTIF(range, criteria)\n     ```\n   - **SUBTOTAL**: Performs calculations (sum, avg, count) on filtered data.\n     ```excel\n     =SUBTOTAL(function_num, range)\n     ```\n     - Ignores hidden rows (useful for dynamic dashboards).\n\n2. **Weighted Average**\n   - **Use Cases**:\n     - Importance of expenditure categories (Q12).\n     - Population size of regions.\n   - **Formula**:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Weighted Avg} = \\sum (w_i \\times x_i)\n     \\]\n     Where \\(w_i\\) = weight, \\(x_i\\) = value.\n\n3. **Days Sales of Inventory (DSI)**\n   - **Purpose**: Measures average days to turn inventory into sales.\n   - **Formula**:\n     \\[\n     DSI = \\frac{\\text{Average Inventory}}{\\text{Cost of Goods Sold}} \\times \\text{Number of Days}\n     \\]\n\n---\n\n#### **C. A/B Testing & Experimentation**\n1. **Key Metrics**\n   - **Primary KPI**: Conversion rate, revenue per user, or engagement (Q7).\n   - **Statistical Significance**: Ensure results are not due to randomness.\n\n2. **Interpreting Results (Q10)**\n   - Compare **treatment (new strategy)** vs. **control (old strategy)**.\n   - Example:\n     | Group      | Avg Credit Txn | Avg Debit Txn |\n     |------------|----------------|---------------|\n     | Treatment  | $1725          | $2780         |\n     | Control    | $1810          | $2679         |\n   - **Conclusion**:\n     - Credit transactions \u2193 (Treatment < Control).\n     - Debit transactions \u2191 (Treatment > Control).\n\n---\n\n#### **D. Operational Efficiency (OEE)**\n1. **Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE)**\n   - **Components**:\n     - **Availability**: % of time equipment is operational.\n       \\[\n       \\text{Availability} = \\frac{\\text{Operating Time}}{\\text{Planned Production Time}} \\times 100\n       \\]\n     - **Performance**: % of maximum speed achieved.\n       \\[\n       \\text{Performance} = \\frac{\\text{Actual Output}}{\\text{Theoretical Output}} \\times 100\n       \\]\n     - **Quality**: % of good units produced.\n       \\[\n       \\text{Quality} = \\frac{\\text{Good Units}}{\\text{Total Units}} \\times 100\n       \\]\n   - **OEE Formula**:\n     \\[\n     OEE = \\text{Availability} \\times \\text{Performance} \\times \\text{Quality}\n     \\]\n   - **Example (Q19\u201322)**:\n     - Planned time = 8 hrs, Lost time (X1) = 1 hr.\n     - Actual speed (X2) = 180 units/hr, Design speed = 200 units/hr.\n     - Good units = 1050 \u2192 Quality (X3) = 83.33%.\n     - OEE (X4) = 87.5% \u00d7 90% \u00d7 83.33% \u2248 65.6%.\n\n---\n\n#### **E. Business Strategy**\n1. **Market Saturation (Q4)**\n   - **Strategy**: Prioritize **upgrade incentives** for existing users (vs. expanding to new regions).\n\n2. **Risk Management (Q9)**\n   - **FinTech Example**: Increase **credit score cutoff** to reduce defaults.\n\n3. **Sales Trends (Q17)**\n   - Identify products with **continuously increasing sales** (e.g., Widget C).\n\n4. **Revenue Contribution (Q18)**\n   - Calculate % revenue by category (e.g., Widgets contribute 30.1%).\n\n---\n\n#### **F. HR & Recruitment (Q23\u201325)**\n1. **Terminology**:\n   - **Indent**: HR form for budget/skills required.\n   - **Employee Referral**: Sourcing talent via existing employees.\n   - **Appraisal**: Evaluating employee performance.\n\n---\n\n---\n\n### **2.
