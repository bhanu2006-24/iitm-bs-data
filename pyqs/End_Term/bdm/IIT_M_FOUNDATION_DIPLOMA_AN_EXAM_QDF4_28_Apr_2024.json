Economics & Market Behavior**\n- **Inferior Goods**: Demand decreases as income increases (e.g., generic brands).\n- **Consumer Preference Shifts**: Adjust product portfolios based on demand trends (e.g., shift from scooters to motorcycles).\n- **Diversification**: Spreading risk across loan portfolios (commercial \u2192 retail/microfinance).\n\n#### **2. Data Analysis & Visualization**\n- **Outliers**: Can skew analysis; must be identified/removed for accurate insights.\n- **Scatter Plots**: Visualize relationships (e.g., sales vs. revenue by product category).\n  - *Key Insight*: Electronics may cluster with higher revenue.\n- **Average Revenue per Unit**:\n  - Formula:\n    \\[\n    \\text{Average Revenue per Unit} = \\frac{\\text{Total Revenue}}{\\text{Sales Quantity}}\n    \\]\n  - *Example*: Home Appliances had the highest average revenue in the given dataset.\n\n#### **3. Inventory Management**\n- **Economic Order Quantity (EOQ)**:\n  - Formula:\n    \\[\n    \\text{EOQ} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2DS}{H}}\n    \\]\n    - \\(D\\) = Annual demand, \\(S\\) = Ordering cost, \\(H\\) = Holding cost.\n  - *Impact*: Increasing ordering cost (\\(S\\)) **increases EOQ**.\n- **Seasonal Inventory Adjustments**: Align stock levels with historical demand patterns.\n- **Days of Inventory**:\n  - Low inventory \u2192 Risk of **stockouts** (lost sales) but **reduces storage costs**.\n  - High inventory \u2192 Higher **carrying costs** but lower stockout risk.\n\n#### **4. Behavioral Economics & Nudges**\n- **Anchoring Effect**: Presenting a high initial price to make discounts seem larger (e.g., e-commerce \"was $100, now $50\").\n- **Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL)**:\n  - Goal: Increase **customer engagement** and **loyalty** (not tax benefits or regulatory stunts).\n\n#### **5. Human Resources & Strategic Planning**\n- **Manpower Planning**:\n  - Relevant factors: Turnover rate, revenue forecasts, business objectives.\n  - *Irrelevant*: General unemployment rate.\n- **Bench/Buffer Employees**: Maintain a pool for **unforeseen project needs** (not to hide underperformers).\n- **Internal Sourcing Advantages**:\n  - Faster staffing, reduced incompetency risk (but **no 100% success guarantee**).\n\n#### **6. Excel & Conditional Logic**\n- **Nested `IF` Statements**:\n  - Syntax:\n    ```excel\n    =IF(condition1, value1, IF(condition2, value2, value3))\n    ```\n  - *Example*: Grading based on marks (e.g., `=IF(C2<=20, \"A\", IF(C2>15, \"B\", ...))`).\n\n#### **7. Operational Efficiency**\n- **Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE)**:\n  - Formula:\n    \\[\n    \\text{OEE} = \\text{Availability} \\times \\text{Performance} \\times \\text{Quality}\n    \\]\n    - *Availability* = \\(\\frac{\\text{Actual Production Time}}{\\text{Planned Production Time}}\\)\n    - *Performance* = \\(\\frac{\\text{Actual Output}}{\\text{Theoretical Output}}\\)\n    - *Quality* = \\(\\frac{\\text{Good Units}}{\\text{Total Units}}\\)\n  - *Example Calculation* (from Q20):\n    - Availability = \\(\\frac{700 - 60}{700} = 0.914\\)\n    - Performance = \\(\\frac{14000}{200 \\times (700 - 60)} = 0.833\\)\n    - Quality = \\(\\frac{14000 - 700}{14000} = 0.95\\)\n    - OEE = \\(0.914 \\times 0.833 \\times 0.95 \\approx 77.5\\%\\).\n\n#### **8. A/B Testing & Experimental Design**\n- **Hypothesis Testing**:\n  - Compare metrics (e.g., playtime, purchases) between **control (Group A)** and **treatment (Group B)**.\n  - *Example*: New game tutorial\u2019s impact on engagement (Group B had lower average playtime in the given data).\n- **Homogeneous Regions in Sampling**: Reduces bias by grouping similar characteristics.\n\n#### **9. Risk Management**\n- **Sales Volatility Risks**:\n  - Over/under-estimating inventory needs.\n  - Misalignment between forecasts and actual sales.\n  - Lead time inaccuracies.\n\n---\n\n---\n\n### **Mermaid Knowledge Graphs**\n#### **1.
