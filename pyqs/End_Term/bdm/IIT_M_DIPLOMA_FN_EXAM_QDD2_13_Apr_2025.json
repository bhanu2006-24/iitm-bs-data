        "summary": "Here\u2019s a structured **summary of core topics, concepts, principles, and equations** for the **Business Data Management (Computer-Based Exam)** based on the question paper, followed by **Mermaid knowledge graphs** to visualize relationships.\n\n---\n\n---\n\n### **Core Topics & Concepts Summary**\n#### **1. Business Economics & Demand Analysis**\n- **Law of Demand**:\n  - **Concept**: Inverse relationship between price and quantity demanded (all else equal).\n  - **Equation**:\n    \\[\n    Q_d = f(P^{-1}, \\text{Income}, \\text{Preferences}, \\text{etc.})\n    \\]\n  - **Key Point**: Higher price \u2192 Lower quantity demanded (Option A in Q2).\n\n- **Income Elasticity of Demand**:\n  - **Normal Goods**: Demand \u2191 when income \u2191 (e.g., Q15: 60 \u2192 90 units as income rises from \u20b915k to \u20b925k).\n  - **Inferior Goods**: Demand \u2193 when income \u2191 (not the case here).\n  - **Luxury Goods**: High income elasticity (not directly tested here).\n\n- **Total Revenue (TR)**:\n  - **Equation**:\n    \\[\n    TR = P \\times Q\n    \\]\n  - **Example (Q14)**:\n    - Income Level 1: \\( TR_1 = 40 \\times 60 = \u20b92400 \\)\n    - Income Level 2: \\( TR_2 = 38 \\times 90 = \u20b93420 \\)\n    - **Percentage Change**:\n      \\[\n      \\frac{TR_2 - TR_1}{TR_1} \\times 100 = \\frac{3420 - 2400}{2400} \\times 100 = 42.5\\%\n      \\]\n\n---\n\n#### **2. Inventory Management**\n- **Days Sales of Inventory (DSI)**:\n  - **Concept**: Average days to sell inventory (Q5).\n  - **Equation**:\n    \\[\n    DSI = \\frac{\\text{Average Inventory}}{\\text{Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)}} \\times 365\n    \\]\n  - **Interpretation**: Lower DSI \u2192 Faster inventory turnover.\n\n---\n\n#### **3. Market Analysis & Strategy**\n- **Market Potential**:\n  - **Key Factors** (Q6):\n    - Size of target market.\n    - % of potential customers interested.\n  - **Saturated Market Strategy** (Q4):\n    - Prioritize **upgrade incentives** for existing users (not new customer acquisition).\n\n- **A/B Testing**:\n  - **Critical Metric** (Q7): **KPIs specific to the experiment** (e.g., conversion rate, transaction value).\n  - **Example (Q10)**:\n    - Compare **treatment vs. control** groups for credit/debit transaction values.\n    - **Conclusion**: Credit transactions \u2193 (1810 \u2192 1725), Debit transactions \u2191 (2679 \u2192 2780) \u2192 **Option D (ii & iv)**.\n\n---\n\n#### **4. Financial Analysis for FinTech**\n- **Profit Calculation** (Q11):\n  - **Revenue Streams**:\n    1. **Transaction Fee**: 3.5% of transaction amount.\n    2. **Interest on Credit**: 18% p.a. (if paid back).\n    3. **Loss on Default**: Full credit amount lost.\n  - **Example Calculation**:\n    - **Approved & Paid Back (Cust ID 17289)**:\n      - Fee: \\( 168 \\times 0.035 = 5.88 \\)\n      - Interest: \\( 168 \\times 0.18 = 30.24 \\)\n      - **Total**: \\( 5.88 + 30.24 = 36.12 \\)\n    - **Approved & Defaulted (Cust ID 17290)**:\n      - Fee: \\( 109 \\times 0.035 = 3.815 \\)\n      - Loss: \\( -109 \\)\n      - **Total**: \\( 3.815 - 109 = -105.185 \\)\n    - **Declined (Cust ID 17291)**: Only transaction fee (no credit).\n    - **Net Profit**: Sum all cases \u2192 **-\u20b9192.72** (Option B).\n\n- **Credit Risk Mitigation** (Q9):\n  - **Action**: Increase **approval cutoff of credit score** to reduce defaults.\n\n---\n\n#### **5. Data Processing & Excel Functions**\n- **COUNTIF**:\n  - **Purpose**: Count cells meeting a condition (Q3).\n  - **Syntax**: `=COUNTIF(range, criteria)`\n\n- **SUBTOTAL**:\n  - **Purpose**: Perform calculations (sum, average, etc.) on **filtered data**, ignoring hidden rows (Q13).\n  - **Syntax**: `=SUBTOTAL(function_num, range)`\n    - `function_num`: 1 (average), 9 (sum), etc.\n\n- **Weighted Average**:\n  - **Applications** (Q12):\n    - Importance of expenditure categories.\n    - Population size of regions.\n  - **Equation**:\n    \\[\n    \\text{Weighted Avg} = \\sum (w_i \\times x_i)\n    \\]\n    where \\( w_i \\) = weight, \\( x_i \\) = value.\n\n---\n\n#### **6. Sales & Revenue Analysis**\n- **Total Revenue Calculation** (Q16):\n  - **Equation**:\n    \\[\n    TR = \\sum (\\text{Monthly Sales} \\times \\text{Unit Price})\n    \\]\n  - **Example**:\n    - **Widget A**: \\( (120 + 150 + 130) \\times 25 = 10,000 \\)\n    - **Total for All Products**: \u20b967,125 (Option A).\n\n- **Sales Trends** (Q17):\n  - **Continuously Increasing**: Check month-over-month growth (e.g., **Widget C**: 100 \u2192 110 \u2192 120).\n\n- **Revenue Contribution** (Q18):\n  - **Widget Revenue**: Sum of all widget sales (SKU01, SKU02, SKU06).\n  - **Percentage**:\n    \\[\n    \\frac{\\text{Widget Revenue}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\times 100 = 30.1\\%\n    \\]\n\n---\n\n#### **7. Operational Efficiency (OEE)**\n- **Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE)**:\n  - **Components** (Q19\u2013Q22):\n    1. **Availability**:\n       \\[\n       \\text{Availability (\\%)} = \\frac{\\text{Planned Prod. Time} - \\text{Lost Time}}{\\text{Planned Prod. Time}} \\times 100\n       \\]\n       - Given: 87.5% \u2192 Solve for **Lost Time (X1 = 1 hr)**.\n    2. **Performance**:\n       \\[\n       \\text{Performance (\\%)} = \\frac{\\text{Actual Output}}{\\text{Design Speed} \\times \\text{Runtime}} \\times 100\n       \\]\n       - Given: 90% \u2192 Solve for **Actual Speed (X2 = 180 units/hr)**.\n    3. **Quality**:\n       \\[\n       \\text{Quality (\\%)} = \\frac{\\text{Good Units}}{\\text{Total Units Produced}} \\times 100\n       \\]\n       - **Good Units = 1050**, Total Units = \\( 180 \\times (8 - 1) = 1260 \\) \u2192 **X3 \u2248 83.3%**.\n    4. **OEE**:\n       \\[\n       OEE = \\text{Availability} \\times \\text{Performance} \\times \\text{Quality} \\approx 65.5\\%\n       \\]\n\n---\n\n#### **8.
