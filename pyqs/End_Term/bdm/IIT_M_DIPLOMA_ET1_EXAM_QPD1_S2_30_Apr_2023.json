Business Metrics & KPIs**\n#### **Key Concepts:**\n- **Churn Rate**:\n  - Definition: Percentage of customers who stop using a product/service in a given period.\n  - Formula:\n    \\[\n    \\text{Churn Rate} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Number of Customers Lost}}{\\text{Total Customers at Start}} \\right) \\times 100\n    \\]\n- **Current Ratio**:\n  - Measures liquidity (short-term solvency).\n  - Formula:\n    \\[\n    \\text{Current Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Current Assets}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}}\n    \\]\n- **Price Elasticity of Demand (PED)**:\n  - Measures responsiveness of demand to price changes.\n  - Formula:\n    \\[\n    \\text{PED} = \\frac{\\%\\ \\text{Change in Quantity Demanded}}{\\%\\ \\text{Change in Price}}\n    \\]\n  - **Interpretation**:\n    - PED > 1: Elastic (demand sensitive to price).\n    - PED < 1: Inelastic (demand insensitive to price).\n\n#### **Marginal Utility & Consumer Behavior**\n- **Marginal Utility (MU)**:\n  - Additional satisfaction from consuming one more unit.\n  - **Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility**: MU decreases as consumption increases.\n  - **Negative MU**: Occurs at overconsumption (total utility starts declining).\n- **Total Utility (TU)**:\n  - Sum of utilities from all units consumed.\n  - Formula:\n    \\[\n    TU = \\sum MU\n    \\]\n\n---\n\n### **2. Data Analysis & Visualization**\n#### **Key Concepts:**\n- **A/B Testing**:\n  - Compares two versions (A vs. B) to determine which performs better (e.g., conversion rates, revenue).\n- **Pareto Principle (80/20 Rule)**:\n  - 80% of effects come from 20% of causes (e.g., 80% sales from 20% products).\n  - **Volume Pareto Criteria**: Identify top contributors to total volume (e.g., Table C in Q20).\n- **Time-Series Trends**:\n  - Analyze patterns over time (e.g., daily sales, credit score trends).\n  - Example: Thursday sales spike (Q10) could be due to:\n    - Promotions (Black Friday).\n    - Data repetition (Thursday appears 3x in 15 days).\n    - Holidays/special events.\n\n#### **Data Cleaning & Transformation**\n- **Text-to-Columns (Excel/Google Sheets)**:\n  - Splits delimited text (e.g., `\"BDM, TDS, BA\"`) into separate columns.\n- **Conditional Formulas (IF Statements)**:\n  - Example (Q12): Calculate commission if approved:\n    ```excel\n    =IF(F2=\"Approved\", E2*0.025, 0)\n    ```\n\n---\n\n### **3. Manufacturing & Operational Efficiency**\n#### **Key Metrics:**\n1. **Availability**:\n   - Measures uptime after accounting for downtime (e.g., maintenance).\n   - Formula:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Availability} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Total Available Time} - \\text{Downtime}}{\\text{Total Available Time}} \\right) \\times 100\n     \\]\n   - **Calculation (Q13)**:\n     - Total shifts: \\(3 \\text{ shifts/day} \\times 6 \\text{ days} = 18\\).\n     - Shifts lost: 3.\n     - Available shifts: \\(18 - 3 = 15\\).\n     - Availability: \\(\\left( \\frac{15}{18} \\right) \\times 100 \\approx 83.3\\%\\).\n\n2. **Performance**:\n   - Actual output vs. designed capacity.\n   - Formula:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Performance} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Actual Output}}{\\text{Designed Output}} \\right) \\times 100\n     \\]\n   - **Calculation (Q14)**:\n     - Designed output: \\(6 \\text{ days} \\times 3 \\text{ shifts/day} \\times 8 \\text{ hours/shift} \\times 60 \\text{ units/hour} = 8640\\).\n     - Actual output: 6243.\n     - Performance: \\(\\left( \\frac{6243}{8640} \\right) \\times 100 \\approx 72.3\\%\\).\n     - *Note: Answer hint suggests 86\u201387.5%, implying possible misinterpretation (e.g., excluding maintenance shifts).*\n\n3. **Quality**:\n   - Good units vs. total units produced.\n   - Formula:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Quality} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Good Units}}{\\text{Total Units}} \\right) \\times 100\n     \\]\n   - **Calculation (Q15)**:\n     - Scrap: 501.\n     - Good units: \\(6243 - 501 = 5742\\).\n     - Quality: \\(\\left( \\frac{5742}{6243} \\right) \\times 100 \\approx 92.0\\%\\).\n\n4. **Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE)**:\n   - Combines Availability, Performance, and Quality.\n   - Formula:\n     \\[\n     \\text{OEE} = \\text{Availability} \\times \\text{Performance} \\times \\text{Quality}\n     \\]\n   - **Calculation (Q16)**:\n     - OEE: \\(0.833 \\times 0.723 \\times 0.920 \\approx 0.56\\) (but hint suggests 0.600\u20130.720; recheck inputs).\n\n#### **Scrap Analysis (Q17\u2013Q18)**\n- **Scrap Percentage**:\n  - Formula:\n    \\[\n    \\text{Scrap \\%} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Total Scrap}}{\\text{Total Output}} \\right) \\times 100\n    \\]\n  - **Calculation (Q17)**:\n    - Total scrap: \\(11 + 7 + \\dots + 7 = 106\\).\n    - Scrap %: \\(\\left( \\frac{106}{2600} \\right) \\times 100 \\approx 4.08\\%\\).\n- **Loss Due to Scrap**:\n  - Formula:\n    \\[\n    \\text{Loss} = \\text{Scrap Units} \\times (\\text{Raw Material Cost} + \\text{Processing Cost})\n    \\]\n  - **Calculation (Q18)**:\n    - Cost per scrap: \\(37 + 33 = 70\\) INR.\n    - Total loss: \\(106 \\times 70 = 7420\\) INR.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Decision-Making & Ranking**\n#### **Composite Score (Q19)**\n- **Method**: Sum normalized scores for \"more is better\" criteria.\n- **Steps**:\n  1. Normalize each column (e.g., min-max scaling).\n  2. Sum scores for each candidate.\n  3. Rank by total score.\n- **Example (Q19)**:\n  - **Alpha** scores highest due to higher skill/project counts despite equal experience.\n\n---\n\n## **Mermaid Knowledge Graphs**\n### **Graph 1: Business Metrics Relationships**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Business Metrics] --> B[Churn Rate]\n    A --> C[Current Ratio]\n    A --> D[Price Elasticity]\n    B --> B1[Customer Retention]\n    C --> C1[Liquidity]\n    C --> C2[Short-Term Solvency]\n    D --> D1[Demand Sensitivity]\n    D --> D2[Pricing Strategy]\n```\n\n### **Graph 2: Manufacturing Efficiency**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    E[Manufacturing KPIs] --> F[Availability]\n    E --> G[Performance]\n    E --> H[Quality]\n    F --> F1[Downtime]\n    G --> G1[Actual vs Designed Output]\n    H --> H1[Defect Rate]\n    E --> I[OEE]\n    I --> F\n    I --> G\n    I --> H\n```\n\n### **Graph 3: Data Analysis Workflow**\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n    J[Data Collection] --> K[Data Cleaning]\n    K --> L[Text-to-Columns]\n    K --> M[Conditional Logic]\n    L --> N[Analysis]\n    M --> N\n    N --> O[A/B Testing]\n    N --> P[Pareto Analysis]\n    N --> Q[Time-Series Trends]\n```\n\n### **Graph 4: Consumer Behavior**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    R[Marginal Utility] --> S[Diminishing Returns]\n    R --> T[Negative Utility]\n    S --> U[Overconsumption]\n    T --> U\n    U --> V[Total Utility Decline]\n```\n\n---\n## **Key Equations Summary**\n| **Concept**               | **Formula**                                                                 |\n|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Churn Rate                | \\((\\text{Customers Lost} / \\text{Total Customers}) \\times 100\\)          |\n| Current Ratio             | \\(\\text{Current Assets} / \\text{Current Liabilities}\\)                     |\n| Price Elasticity          | \\(\\% \\Delta \\text{Qty Demanded} / \\% \\Delta \\text{Price}\\)                |\n| Availability              | \\((\\text{Available Time} - \\text{Downtime}) / \\text{Available Time}\\)    |\n| Performance               | \\(\\text{Actual Output} / \\text{Designed Output}\\)                         |\n| Quality                   | \\(\\text{Good Units} / \\text{Total Units}\\)                                |\n| OEE                       | \\(\\text{Availability} \\times \\text{Performance} \\times \\text{Quality}\\) |\n| Scrap %                   | \\((\\text{Scrap Units} / \\text{Total Output}) \\times 100\\)                |\n| Loss Due to Scrap         | \\(\\text{Scrap Units} \\times (\\text{Raw Cost} + \\text{Processing Cost})\\)  |",
