        "summary": "Here\u2019s a structured **summary of core topics, concepts, principles, and equations** for the **Business Data Management (Computer-Based Exam)** based on the provided question paper.\nThe exam covers **Business Analytics, Data Interpretation, Inventory Management, Behavioral Economics, Strategic Decision-Making, and Performance Metrics**.\n\n---\n\n---\n\n### **1. Core Topics & Concepts**\n#### **A. Economics & Consumer Behavior**\n1. **Inferior Goods**\n   - Definition: Goods whose demand **decreases** as consumer income **increases** (e.g., generic brands, public transport).\n   - Contrast with **normal goods** (demand increases with income) and **luxury goods** (demand increases more than proportionally with income).\n\n2. **Anchoring Effect (Behavioral Economics)**\n   - Cognitive bias where individuals rely too heavily on the **first piece of information** (anchor) when making decisions.\n   - Example: Displaying a high \"original price\" next to a discounted price to make the discount seem larger.\n\n3. **Nudging in E-Commerce**\n   - Subtle changes in choice architecture to influence behavior (e.g., default options, social proof, scarcity).\n   - Example: \"Only 2 left in stock!\" or \"90% of buyers also purchased this.\"\n\n---\n\n#### **B. Inventory & Supply Chain Management**\n1. **Economic Order Quantity (EOQ)**\n   - Formula:\n     \\[\n     EOQ = \\sqrt{\\frac{2DS}{H}}\n     \\]\n     - \\(D\\) = Annual demand\n     - \\(S\\) = Ordering cost per order\n     - \\(H\\) = Holding cost per unit per year\n   - **Impact of Ordering Cost**: If \\(S\\) increases, **EOQ increases** (fewer, larger orders).\n\n2. **Inventory Turnover & Days of Inventory**\n   - **Low inventory days** (vs. industry standard) may indicate:\n     - **Risk of stockouts** (lost sales).\n     - **Lower carrying costs** (less warehouse space needed).\n   - **High inventory days** may indicate:\n     - Excess stock, higher holding costs, or obsolescence risk.\n\n3. **Seasonal Inventory Adjustment**\n   - Use **historical sales data** to forecast demand and adjust inventory levels accordingly.\n   - Example: Stock up on winter coats in Q4, reduce in Q2.\n\n4. **Safety Stock & Lead Time**\n   - **Risk of sudden sales changes**:\n     - Overestimation \u2192 excess stock.\n     - Underestimation \u2192 stockouts.\n     - Misaligned forecasts \u2192 poor replenishment planning.\n\n---\n\n#### **C. Data Analysis & Visualization**\n1. **Outliers in Data**\n   - **Why remove/address outliers?**\n     - Skew mean/median, distort regression models, mislead interpretations.\n   - Methods: Winsorization, truncation, or robust statistics (e.g., IQR-based filtering).\n\n2. **Scatter Plots & Clustering**\n   - **Color-coding by category** reveals patterns:\n     - Example: Electronics may cluster with **high revenue/sales**, while clothing may show lower revenue despite higher sales volume.\n   - **Average Revenue per Unit (ARPU)**:\n     \\[\n     ARPU = \\frac{\\text{Total Revenue}}{\\text{Total Units Sold}}\n     \\]\n     - Compare across categories to identify high-margin products.\n\n3. **Pivot Tables for Portfolio Analysis**\n   - **Diversification** (e.g., shift from commercial to retail/microfinance loans) may indicate:\n     - Risk mitigation, regulatory changes, or market demand shifts.\n   - **Limitation**: Pivot tables show **correlations, not causation**.\n\n---\n\n#### **D. Strategic Decision-Making**\n1. **Product Portfolio Adjustment**\n   - **Response to demand shifts**:\n     - Increase production for **growing segments** (e.g., motorcycles).\n     - Phase out or reduce **declining segments** (e.g., scooters).\n   - Avoid: Overinvesting in declining products or ignoring trends.\n\n2. **Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) Strategy**\n   - **Why offer 0% interest?**\n     - Increase **customer loyalty**, transaction volume, and platform stickiness.\n     - Monetize via **merchant fees** or upselling.\n\n3. **Internal Sourcing (HR)**\n   - **Advantages**:\n     - Faster hiring (no external recruitment).\n     - Lower risk of incompetence (familiarity with company culture).\n   - **Limitations**:\n     - Limited talent pool; may not eliminate external hiring entirely.\n\n4. **Strategic Manpower Planning**\n   - **Key factors**:\n     - Historical turnover, revenue forecasts, business objectives.\n   - **Irrelevant factor**: General unemployment rate (unless industry-specific).\n\n---\n\n#### **E. Performance Metrics**\n1. **Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE)**\n   - Formula:\n     \\[\n     OEE = \\text{Availability} \\times \\text{Performance} \\times \\text{Quality}\n     \\]\n     - **Availability**:\n       \\[\n       \\frac{\\text{Actual Production Time}}{\\text{Planned Production Time}} = \\frac{700 - 60}{700} = 0.914\n       \\]\n     - **Performance**:\n       \\[\n       \\frac{\\text{Actual Output}}{\\text{Theoretical Output}} = \\frac{14000}{200 \\times (700 - 60)} = \\frac{14000}{128000} = 0.1094 \\quad (\\text{Note: Actual rate was 180/hr})\n       \\]\n       Correction:\n       \\[\n       \\text{Theoretical Output} = 200 \\times 640 = 128,000 \\quad \\text{(but actual rate was 180/hr)}\n       \\]\n       \\[\n       \\text{Actual Output} = 180 \\times 640 = 115,200 \\quad \\text{(but given as 14,000)}\n       \\]\n       **Clarification**: The question states 14,000 units were assembled in 640 hours (700 - 60), so:\n       \\[\n       \\text{Performance} = \\frac{14000}{200 \\times 640} = \\frac{14000}{128000} = 0.1094 \\quad (\\text{Incorrect; actual rate was 180/hr})\n       \\]\n       **Correct Calculation**:\n       \\[\n       \\text{Performance} = \\frac{\\text{Actual Rate}}{\\text{Theoretical Rate}} = \\frac{180}{200} = 0.9\n       \\]\n     - **Quality**:\n       \\[\n       \\frac{\\text{Good Units}}{\\text{Total Units}} = \\frac{14000 - 700}{14000} = 0.95\n       \\]\n     - **Final OEE**:\n       \\[\n       0.914 \\times 0.9 \\times 0.95 = 0.777 \\quad (\\text{~77.7%})\n       \\]\n\n2. **Benchmarking**\n   - Compare OEE to industry standards to identify inefficiencies (e.g., downtime, defects).\n\n---\n\n#### **F. Excel & Data Tools**\n1. **Nested IF Functions**\n   - Syntax:\n     ```excel\n     =IF(condition1, value1, IF(condition2, value2, ...))\n     ```\n   - Example (grading):\n     ```excel\n     =IF(C2>=20, \"A\", IF(C2>=15, \"B\", IF(C2>=10, \"C\", \"D\")))\n     ```\n     - **Note**: Conditions should be **descending** (highest threshold first).\n\n2. **Candidate Ranking (Weighted Scoring)**\n   - Assign equal weights to criteria (skills, join time, certificates, experience).\n   - **Normalize** each criterion (e.g., lower \"days to join\" is better).\n   - Example:\n     | Candidate | Skills (\u2191) | Join Time (\u2193) | Certificates (\u2191) | Experience (\u2191) | **Total Score** |\n     |-----------|------------|---------------|-------------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n     | A         | 12         | 30            | 5                 | 3               | **Sum of ranks** |\n     - **Rank 1 (Best)**: Candidate D (high skills/experience, low join time).\n\n---\n\n#### **G. A/B Testing & Experimental Design**\n1. **Hypothesis Testing for Tutorial Impact**\n   - Compare **Group A (old tutorial)** vs. **Group B (new tutorial)**:\n     - Metrics: Daily playtime, in-game purchases.\n   - **Findings from Data**:\n     - Group A (old) had **higher average playtime** (contradicts the hypothesis that the new tutorial is better).\n     - **No significant difference** in purchases across experience levels.\n     - **Possible conclusion**: New tutorial may **reduce engagement** (playtime dropped in Group B).\n\n2. **Segmentation by Experience Level**\n   - Analyze impact on **beginners, intermediate, advanced** players separately.\n   - Example: Advanced players in Group B showed **higher purchases**, but intermediates did not.\n\n---\n\n---\n\n### **2.

Exam Tips**\n1. **For Math/Excel Questions**:\n   - Double-check **EOQ** and **OEE** calculations (common pitfalls: units, descending IF conditions).\n   - Remember: **OEE is a product of three ratios** (not sums).\n\n2. **For Data Interpretation**:\n   - Look for **clusters** in scatter plots (e.g., electronics vs. clothing).\n   - **Outliers** can distort averages\u2014consider median/IQR.\n\n3. **For Strategic Questions**:\n   - **Diversification** \u2260 always better; justify with data.\n   - **BNPL** is about **volume and loyalty**, not direct interest revenue.\n\n4. **For A/B Testing**:\n   - Compare **means** (playtime, purchases) but also check **segmentation** (beginner vs. advanced).",
