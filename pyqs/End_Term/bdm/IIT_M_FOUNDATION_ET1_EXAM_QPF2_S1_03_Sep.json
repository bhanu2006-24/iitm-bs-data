        "summary": "Here\u2019s a structured **summary of core topics, concepts, principles, and equations** for the **Business Data Management (Diploma Level)** exam, followed by **Mermaid knowledge graphs** to visualize relationships.\n\n---\n\n## **1. Core Topics & Concepts**\n### **A. Excel & Data Lookup Functions**\n- **VLOOKUP**:\n  - `range_lookup` parameter:\n    - `TRUE` (1): Approximate match (default).\n    - `FALSE` (0): Exact match.\n  - Syntax:\n    ```excel\n    =VLOOKUP(lookup_value, table_array, col_index_num, [range_lookup])\n    ```\n\n### **B. Inventory Management**\n- **Key Metrics**:\n  1. **Average Days of Inventory (ADI)**:\n     \\[\n     \\text{ADI} = \\frac{\\text{Open Stock}}{\\text{Average Daily Sales}}\n     \\]\n  2. **Reorder Point (ROP)**:\n     \\[\n     \\text{ROP} = (\\text{Daily Usage} \\times \\text{Lead Time}) + \\text{Safety Stock}\n     \\]\n  3. **Reorder Time (in days)**:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Reorder Time} = \\frac{\\text{Starting Inventory} - \\text{ROP}}{\\text{Daily Usage}}\n     \\]\n\n### **C. Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE)**\n- **Formula**:\n  \\[\n  \\text{OEE} = \\text{Availability} \\times \\text{Performance} \\times \\text{Quality}\n  \\]\n  - **Availability**:\n    \\[\n    \\text{Availability} = \\frac{\\text{Run Time}}{\\text{Planned Production Hours}} \\times 100\\%\n    \\]\n  - **Performance**:\n    \\[\n    \\text{Performance} = \\frac{\\text{Actual Machine Speed}}{\\text{Design Machine Speed}} \\times 100\\%\n    \\]\n  - **Quality**:\n    \\[\n    \\text{Quality} = \\frac{\\text{Good Products}}{\\text{Total Products}} \\times 100\\%\n    \\]\n\n### **D. Employee Attrition Rate**\n- **Formula**:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Attrition Rate (\\%)} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Employee Departures}}{\\text{Average Employees}} \\right) \\times 100\n  \\]\n  - **Average Employees**:\n    \\[\n    \\text{Average Employees} = \\frac{\\text{Initial Employees} + \\text{Final Employees}}{2}\n    \\]\n\n### **E. Pareto Principle (80/20 Rule)**\n- **Concept**: Focus on the **20% of causes** that drive **80% of results**.\n- **Applications**:\n  - Prioritizing high-impact tasks.\n  - Resource allocation in business processes.\n\n### **F. Nudge Economics**\n- **Concept**: Indirectly influencing behavior without coercion (e.g., providing information, default options).\n- **Example**: Displaying nutritional info (vs. banning sugary drinks).\n\n### **G. Loan Risk Assessment**\n- **Key Factors**:\n  - **Debt-to-Income (DTI) Ratio**:\n    \\[\n    \\text{DTI} = \\frac{\\text{Loan Amount}}{\\text{Income}}\n    \\]\n  - **Credit Score**: Higher scores \u2192 Lower risk.\n  - **Loan Amount vs. Income**: Higher loan-to-income \u2192 Higher risk.\n\n### **H. Recruitment Channel Effectiveness**\n- **Effectiveness Score**:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Score} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Shortlisted}}{\\text{Applications}} \\right) \\times \\text{Normalized Ease of Applying}\n  \\]\n  - **Normalization** (Min-Max Scaling):\n    \\[\n    \\text{Normalized Score} = \\frac{\\text{Score} - \\text{Min}}{\\text{Max} - \\text{Min}}\n    \\]\n\n### **I. A/B Testing**\n- **Key Metrics**:\n  - **Average Transaction Amount/Volume** (Before vs. After).\n  - **Lift**: Percentage change due to treatment (e.g., cashback program).\n    \\[\n    \\text{Lift (\\%)} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Test Group Metric} - \\text{Control Group Metric}}{\\text{Control Group Metric}} \\right) \\times 100\n    \\]\n\n### **J. Price Elasticity of Demand (PED)**\n- **Formula**:\n  \\[\n  \\text{PED} = \\frac{\\%\\Delta \\text{Quantity Demanded}}{\\%\\Delta \\text{Price}}\n  \\]\n  - **Interpretation**:\n    - \\(|PED| > 1\\): Elastic (demand sensitive to price).\n    - \\(|PED| < 1\\): Inelastic (demand insensitive to price).\n  - **Quantity Ratio with PED**:\n    \\[\n    \\frac{Q_{\\text{new}}}{Q_{\\text{old}}} = \\left( \\frac{P_{\\text{old}}}{P_{\\text{new}}} \\right)^{|\\text{PED}|}\n    \\]\n\n### **K. Cost Curves in Economics**\n- **Marginal Cost (MC)**: Cost of producing **one additional unit**.\n- **Average Total Cost (ATC)**:\n  \\[\n  \\text{ATC} = \\frac{\\text{Total Cost (Fixed + Variable)}}{\\text{Quantity}}\n  \\]\n- **Marginal Revenue (MR)**: Revenue from selling **one additional unit**.\n\n---\n\n## **2.
