Thank you for taking the time to interview for the role of instructional designer at Bridgespan Education. I\u2019m curious to hear more about your interest in the learning design industry. Why are you in this industry?  Min: Nice to meet you too! I\u2019m so excited to be here today and thankful to you for having given me this opportunity. So, I\u2019ve been a curriculum developer in various educational and corporate settings for the past 10 years. I\u2019m very passionate about creating data-driven and aesthetically appealing learning solutions in different formats \u2014 be it instructor-led, e-learning, and blended learning. I applied for this role because I watched a news piece on how your CEO Mr. Raul brought in an indoor mapping tool that made hybrid work possible for employees working from anywhere \u2014 I thought that was quite amazing, and I\u2019d be thrilled to meet him sometime.

Why are you in this industry?  Min: Nice to meet you too! I\u2019m so excited to be here today and thankful to you for having given me this opportunity. So, I\u2019ve been a curriculum developer in various educational and corporate settings for the past 10 years. I\u2019m very passionate about creating data-driven and aesthetically appealing learning solutions in different formats \u2014 be it instructor-led, e-learning, and blended learning. I applied for this role because I watched a news piece on how your CEO Mr. Raul brought in an indoor mapping tool that made hybrid work possible for employees working from anywhere \u2014 I thought that was quite amazing, and I\u2019d be thrilled to meet him sometime.

Secondly, I\u2019m also huge on teamwork and collaboration, and given that the role and your company\u2019s values emphasise teamwork, it sounded like the perfect fit for me. Thirdly, the position matches my prior experience, but is also challenging enough that I know I\u2019ll have the space to pick up new skills and grow.  Anisha: That\u2019s great, thanks so much!",

Thank you for taking the time to interview for the role of instructional designer at Bridgespan Education. I\u2019m curious to hear more about your interest in the learning design industry. Why are you in this industry?  Min: Nice to meet you too! I\u2019m so excited to be here today and thankful to you for having given me this opportunity. So, I\u2019ve been a curriculum developer in various educational and corporate settings for the past 10 years. I\u2019m very passionate about creating data-driven and aesthetically appealing learning solutions in different formats \u2014 be it instructor-led, e-learning, and blended learning. I applied for this role because I watched a news piece on how your CEO Mr. Raul brought in an indoor mapping tool that made hybrid work possible for employees working from anywhere \u2014 I thought that was quite amazing, and I\u2019d be thrilled to meet him sometime.   Anisha: We can definitely have you meet him if things work out! It\u2019s great that you\u2019ve been following our company for some time now. I\u2019d like to follow up with another question \u2014 why this role and this company, in particular?  Min: Well, there are three reasons I applied for this role in particular \u2014 I\u2019d love to dive into them if you\u2019d like to know more about that!  Anisha: nods enthusiastically  Min: The first is that your company is known to put a strong emphasis on innovations and research, and I\u2019d love to be a part of a company that wants to constantly develop their products. Secondly, I\u2019m also huge on teamwork and collaboration, and given that the role and your company\u2019s values emphasise teamwork, it sounded like the perfect fit for me. Thirdly, the position matches my prior experience, but is also challenging enough that I know I\u2019ll have the space to pick up new skills and grow.  Anisha: That\u2019s great, thanks so much!"
