        "summary": "Here\u2019s a structured **summary of core topics, concepts, principles, and equations** for the **\"Industry 4.0\"** exam, followed by **Mermaid knowledge graphs** to visualize relationships.\n\n---\n\n### **Core Topics & Key Concepts**\n#### **1. Industrial Revolutions**\n- **1st Revolution (1760-1840)**: Mechanization (England).\n- **2nd Revolution (1870-1914)**: Mass production (USA).\n- **3rd Revolution (1960s)**: Automation (USA/Japan).\n- **4th Revolution (Present)**: Cyber-physical systems (Germany).\n\n#### **2. Facility Layouts**\n- **Product Layout**: High-volume, low-variety (e.g., assembly lines).\n- **Group Layout (Cellular)**: Medium-volume, medium-variety (e.g., Geet Mobile\u2019s headsets).\n- **Fixed Position Layout**: Large/immovable products (e.g., ships).\n- **Purposes**:\n  - Minimize material handling delays.\n  - Enhance sales (manufacturing/service).\n  - Enable maintenance.\n\n#### **3. Forecasting Methods**\n- **Exponential Smoothing**:\n  - **Holt\u2019s Linear Trend Model** (for trend + level):\n    ```math\n    F_{t+1} = a_t + b_t\n    a_t = \\alpha D_t + (1 - \\alpha)(a_{t-1} + b_{t-1})\n    b_t = \\beta(a_t - a_{t-1}) + (1 - \\beta)b_{t-1}\n    ```\n  - **Winter\u2019s Model**: Adds seasonality.\n- **Time Series Tasks**:\n  - Identify patterns (trend, seasonality).\n  - Discover relationships among variables.\n\n#### **4. Digitization vs. Digitalization**\n- **Digitization**: Converting physical to digital (e.g., scanning invoices, CAD drawings).\n- **Digitalization**: Using digital data to improve processes (e.g., automated sales reports).\n\n#### **5. Internet Types**\n- **Industrial Internet**: Smart metering.\n- **Commercial Internet**: Banking systems.\n- **Consumer Internet**: Entertainment devices.\n\n#### **6. Consumer Behavior**\n- **Impulse Buying**: Unplanned purchases (e.g., Uncle Chips at checkout).\n- **Complementary/Substitute Goods**:\n  - Tea & Coffee: **Substitutes**.\n  - Tea & Milk Powder: **Complements**.\n\n#### **7. Facility Location Problems**\n- **Euclidean Method**:\n  - Optimal solution is a **point** (not a region).\n  - Rarely matches the **center of gravity**.\n- **Cross-Median Approach**: Finds optimal coordinates (e.g., for demand points A(1,2), B(2,3), etc.).\n  - Example solution: (2,2), (3,2), or (2.5,2).\n\n#### **8. Inventory Management**\n- **Economic Order Quantity (EOQ)**:\n  ```math\n  EOQ = \\sqrt{\\frac{2DS}{H}}\n  ```\n  - **D**: Annual demand (80,000 units).\n  - **S**: Order cost (Rs. 1,200).\n  - **H**: Holding cost (6% of Rs. 50 = Rs. 3/unit).\n  - **EOQ = 8,000 units**.\n  - **Number of Orders/Year**: \\( D/EOQ = 10 \\).\n  - **Annual Costs**:\n    - Ordering: \\( S \\times (D/EOQ) = 12,000 \\).\n    - Holding: \\( (EOQ/2) \\times H = 12,000 \\).\n\n#### **9. Revenue Management**\n- **Booking Limit**: Seats reserved for high-fare classes.\n  - Example: 100 seats, business demand ~U[10,20], economy revenue = Rs. 2,500, business = Rs. 7,500.\n  - **Booking Limit = 17** (protect 83 for business).\n- **Newsvendor Model**:\n  - Optimal stock \\( Q^* \\) where \\( P(D \\leq Q^*) = \\frac{c_u}{c_u + c_o} \\).\n  - For normal demand (\u03bc=300, \u03c3=20), \\( Q^* = 308 \\).\n  - For discrete demand, \\( Q^* = 300 \\).\n\n#### **10. Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) vs. TSP**\n- **VRP-Specific Constraints**:\n  - Capacity restrictions.\n  - Fixed starting point (depot).\n- **TSP**: Only distance minimization.\n\n#### **11. Supply Chain Costs**\n- Affected by distribution network:\n  - Inventory, transportation, facilities/handling, information.\n\n#### **12. Outsourcing Demerits**\n- Loss of supply chain visibility.\n- Leakage of sensitive data.\n- Reduced customer contact.\n- Over-reliance on third parties.\n\n#### **13. Dynamic Programming (Investment Problem)**\n- **Stage**: Year.\n- **State Variable**: Capital at start of year.\n- **Alternatives**: Allocation between Bank 1 and Bank 2.\n\n#### **14. Euclidean Distance**\n- Between points \\( A(x_1, y_1) \\) and \\( B(x_2, y_2) \\):\n  ```math\n  \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\n  ```\n  - Example: A(5,10), B(2,6) \u2192 Distance \u2248 5.1.\n\n#### **15. Production Line Balancing**\n- **Workstations Calculation**:\n  ```math\n  \\text{Workstations} = \\frac{\\text{Total Task Time} \\times \\text{Daily Production}}{\\text{Shift Duration (seconds)}}\n  ```\n  - Example: 12 sec/bulb, 24,000 bulbs/day, 2 shifts \u2192 **5 workstations**.\n\n---\n\n### **Mermaid Knowledge Graphs**\n#### **Graph 1: Industrial Revolutions & Facility Layouts**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Industry 4.0] --> B[1st Revolution: Mechanization]\n    A --> C[2nd Revolution: Mass Production]\n    A --> D[3rd Revolution: Automation]\n    A --> E[4th Revolution: Cyber-Physical Systems]\n    E --> F[Germany]\n    E --> G[Smart Manufacturing]\n\n    H[Facility Layouts] --> I[Product Layout]\n    H --> J[Group Layout]\n    H --> K[Fixed Position Layout]\n    J --> L[Geet Mobile Example]\n```\n\n#### **Graph 2: Forecasting & Inventory**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    M[Forecasting] --> N[Exponential Smoothing]\n    N --> O[Holt's Model: Level + Trend]\n    N --> P[Winter's Model: Seasonality]\n    M --> Q[Time Series Tasks]\n    Q --> R[Pattern Identification]\n    Q --> S[Variable Relationships]\n\n    T[Inventory] --> U[EOQ Model]\n    U --> V[Optimal Order Quantity]\n    U --> W[Annual Costs]\n```\n\n#### **Graph 3: Consumer Behavior & Revenue Management**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    X[Consumer Behavior] --> Y[Impulse Buying]\n    X --> Z[Complementary/Substitute Goods]\n    Z --> AA[Tea & Coffee: Substitutes]\n    Z --> AB[Tea & Milk: Complements]\n\n    AC[Revenue Management] --> AD[Booking Limits]\n    AD --> AE[Protect High-Fare Seats]\n    AC --> AF[Newsvendor Model]\n    AF --> AG[Optimal Stocking]\n```\n\n#### **Graph 4: Supply Chain & Outsourcing**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    AH[Supply Chain Costs] --> AI[Inventory]\n    AH --> AJ[Transportation]\n    AH --> AK[Facilities/Handling]\n    AH --> AL[Information]\n\n    AM[Outsourcing] --> AN[Loss of Visibility]\n    AM --> AO[Data Leakage]\n    AM --> AP[Reduced Customer Contact]\n```\n\n#### **Graph 5: Dynamic Programming & VRP**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    AQ[Dynamic Programming] --> AR[Stages: Years]\n    AQ --> AS[State: Capital]\n    AQ --> AT[Alternatives: Investments]\n\n    AU[Vehicle Routing Problem] --> AV[Capacity Constraints]\n    AU --> AW[Fixed Start Point]\n    AU --> AX[Subtour Elimination]\n```\n\n---\n### **Key Equations Summary**\n| **Concept**               | **Equation**                                                                 |\n|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Holt\u2019s Linear Trend**   | \\( F_{t+1} = a_t + b_t \\)                                                   |\n|                           | \\( a_t = \\alpha D_t + (1 - \\alpha)(a_{t-1} + b_{t-1}) \\)                   |\n|                           | \\( b_t = \\beta(a_t - a_{t-1}) + (1 - \\beta)b_{t-1} \\)                     |\n| **EOQ**                   | \\( EOQ = \\sqrt{\\frac{2DS}{H}} \\)                                             |\n| **Euclidean Distance**    | \\( \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2} \\)                                  |\n| **Newsvendor Critical Fractile** | \\( P(D \\leq Q^*) = \\frac{c_u}{c_u + c_o} \\)                          |\n| **Workstations**          | \\( \\frac{\\text{Total Task Time} \\times \\text{Production}}{\\text{Shift Time}} \\) |",
