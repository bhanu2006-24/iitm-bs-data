Core Topics & Concepts**\n### **A. Industrial Revolutions**\n- **1st Revolution (1760-1840)**: Mechanization (steam engine, water power).\n  *Country*: **England**.\n- **2nd Revolution (1870-1914)**: Mass production (electricity, assembly lines).\n  *Country*: **USA**.\n- **3rd Revolution (1960s)**: Automation (computers, PLCs, robotics).\n  *Countries*: **USA/Japan**.\n- **4th Revolution (Present)**: **Industry 4.0** (IoT, AI, cyber-physical systems, smart factories).\n  *Country*: **Germany**.\n\n### **B. Consumer Behavior & Demand Patterns**\n| **Scenario**               | **Concept**                     | **Example**                          |\n|----------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| **Complementary Goods**    | Products used together.         | Tea & Milk Powder                    |\n| **Substitution**           | Products replacing each other.  | Good-day vs. Sun-fist biscuits       |\n| **Impulse Buying**         | Unplanned purchases.            | Milk powder (not on list)            |\n| **Inventory-Dependent**    | Demand influenced by stock.     | Limited Good-day biscuits \u2192 Buy Sun-fist |\n\n### **C. Forecasting Models**\n1. **Exponential Smoothing**:\n   - **Equation**:\n     \\[\n     F_{t+1} = D_t + (1 - \\alpha) F_t\n     \\]\n     (where \\(F_t\\) = forecast, \\(D_t\\) = actual demand, \\(\\alpha\\) = smoothing factor).\n   - **Key Idea**: Weights recent data more heavily.\n\n2. **Simple Moving Average (Not in exam, but good to know)**:\n   \\[\n   F_{t+1} = \\frac{D_t + D_{t-1} + \\dots + D_{t-n+1}}{n}\n   \\]\n\n### **D. Facility Layout & Production Systems**\n| **Layout Type**       | **Description**                                  | **Example**                          |\n|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| **Product Layout**    | Sequential stations for assembly line.          | Ashoke Motors (car assembly).        |\n| **Process Layout**    | Grouped by function (e.g., all lathes together). | Machine shops.                       |\n| **Fixed Position**    | Product stays; workers/machines move.           | Shipbuilding, aircraft assembly.    |\n\n**Key Purpose of Facility Layout**:\n- Minimize material handling.\n- Optimize space utilization.\n- **Not directly for sales enhancement (Option C in Q6 is incorrect)**.\n\n### **E. Inventory & Supply Chain Management**\n1. **Economic Order Quantity (EOQ)**:\n   - **Equation**:\n     \\[\n     EOQ = \\sqrt{\\frac{2DS}{H}}\n     \\]\n     (where \\(D\\) = annual demand, \\(S\\) = ordering cost, \\(H\\) = holding cost/unit/year).\n   - **Related Formulas**:\n     - Number of orders/year = \\(D / EOQ\\).\n     - Annual holding cost = \\((EOQ/2) \\times H\\).\n   - **Impact of Cost Changes**:\n     - If ordering cost (\\(S\\)) increases by 20%, EOQ increases by \\(\\sqrt{1.2} \\approx 9.54\\%\\).\n\n2. **Supply Chain Costs Affected by Distribution Network**:\n   - Inventory, transportation, facilities/handling, information.\n\n3. **Outsourcing Limitations**:\n   - Not useful when:\n     - High production volumes (economies of scale lost).\n     - Supply uncertainty.\n     - Need for specialized resources.\n     - Quality risks.\n\n### **F. Logistics & Routing Problems**\n| **Problem**               | **Key Features**                                                                 |\n|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Traveling Salesman (TSP)** | Find shortest route visiting all nodes once.                                    |\n| **Vehicle Routing (VRP)**   | Extends TSP with:\n   - **Capacity constraints** (unlike TSP).\n   - **Fixed start/end points**.\n   - **Subtour elimination** (common to both).                                      |\n\n**Decision Variable in VRP**:\n- \\(X_{i,j}\\) = Binary (1 if vehicle travels from \\(i\\) to \\(j\\), else 0).\n\n### **G. Dynamic Programming (Workforce Planning)**\n- **Stage**: Time period (e.g., weeks).\n- **State Variable**: Workers available at end of previous week.\n- **Alternatives**: Number of workers in current week.\n- **Cost Components**:\n  - Hiring cost = Fixed ($400) + $200/worker.\n  - Excess labor cost = $300/worker/week.\n\n### **H. Location & Distance Metrics**\n1. **Euclidean Distance** (between points \\(A(x_1, y_1)\\) and \\(B(x_2, y_2)\\)):\n   \\[\n   d = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\n   \\]\n   - Example: \\(A(5,10)\\), \\(B(2,6)\\) \u2192 \\(d = 5\\).\n\n2. **Cross-Median Approach** (for optimal facility location):\n   - Sort \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) coordinates of demand points separately.\n   - Median of sorted lists gives optimal location.\n   - Example: Demand at (1,2), (2,3), (3,5), (4,1) \u2192 Optimal at **(2,2)** or **(3,2)**.\n\n### **I. Revenue Management (Flight Booking)**\n- **Booking Limit**: Max economy seats = Total seats \u2013 Protection level.\n- **Protection Level**: Seats reserved for business class.\n  - Given:\n    - Business demand ~ Uniform[10,40].\n    - Business revenue = \u20b97,500, Economy = \u20b92,500.\n  - **Protection Level** = 70 seats (since \\(P(D \\leq 70) = 1\\)).\n  - **Booking Limit** = 100 \u2013 70 = 30.\n\n### **J. Industry 4.0 Technologies**\n| **Term**               | **Definition**                                  | **Example**                          |\n|------------------------|------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| **Automation**         | Machines perform tasks with minimal human input. | Car wash on conveyor belt.          |\n| **Digitization**       | Converting analog to digital data.             | Scanning paper records.              |\n| **Digital Transformation** | Integrating digital tech into all business areas. | AI-driven supply chain.          |\n| **Saas**               | Software as a Service (cloud-based applications). | Google Workspace, Salesforce.    |\n\n---\n\n## **2. Key Equations Summary**\n| **Topic**               | **Equation**                                                                 |\n|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Exponential Smoothing   | \\(F_{t+1} = D_t + (1 - \\alpha) F_t\\)                                      |\n| EOQ                     | \\(EOQ = \\sqrt{\\frac{2DS}{H}}\\)                                             |\n| Euclidean Distance      | \\(d = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\\)                               |\n| Cross-Median Location   | \\(x_{median}, y_{median}\\) of sorted demand points.                        |\n| Workforce Cost (DP)     | Hiring: \\(400 + 200 \\times \\text{new hires}\\), Excess: \\(300 \\times \\text{extra workers}\\) |\n\n---\n\n## **3.
