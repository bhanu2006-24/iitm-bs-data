Core Topics & Concepts**\n### **A. Industrial Revolutions**\n- **1st Revolution (1760-1840)**: Mechanization (steam engine, textiles).\n  *Country*: **England**.\n- **2nd Revolution (1870-1914)**: Mass production (electricity, assembly lines).\n  *Country*: **USA**.\n- **3rd Revolution (1960s)**: Automation (computers, PLCs).\n  *Countries*: **USA/Japan**.\n- **4th Revolution (Present)**: Cyber-physical systems (IoT, AI, big data).\n  *Country*: **Germany** (Industrie 4.0 initiative).\n\n### **B. Demand & Inventory Management**\n#### **Key Scenarios**:\n1. **Complementary Products** (e.g., tea & coffee).\n2. **Substitution** (e.g., Good-day vs. Sun-fist biscuits).\n3. **Impulse Buying** (unplanned purchases, e.g., milk powder).\n4. **Inventory-Dependent Demand** (stockouts drive substitutions).\n\n#### **Forecasting Models**:\n- **Exponential Smoothing**:\n  \\[\n  F_{t+1} = \\alpha D_t + (1 - \\alpha) F_t\n  \\]\n  (Where \\(F_t\\) = forecast, \\(D_t\\) = actual demand, \\(\\alpha\\) = smoothing factor).\n  *Note*: Option A in Q4 is incorrect; the correct form is above.\n\n- **Cross-Median Approach** (for facility location):\n  - Median of **x-coordinates** and **y-coordinates** of demand points.\n  - Example: For points A(1,2), B(2,3), C(3,5), D(4,1), the cross-median is **(2,2)** or **(3,2)**.\n\n#### **Economic Order Quantity (EOQ)**:\n\\[\nEOQ = \\sqrt{\\frac{2DS}{H}}\n\\]\n- \\(D\\) = Annual demand (10,000 units).\n- \\(S\\) = Ordering cost (Rs 400).\n- \\(H\\) = Holding cost/unit/year (Rs 2).\n- **EOQ** = 2000 units (Q18).\n- **Number of Orders/Year** = \\(D/EOQ = 5\\) (Q19).\n- **Annual Carrying Cost** = \\((EOQ/2) \\times H = 2000\\) (Q20).\n- **Impact of 20% Increase in Ordering Cost**:\n  New \\(S' = 480\\), new \\(EOQ' = \\sqrt{2 \\times 10000 \\times 480 / 2} \\approx 2191\\).\n  **% Increase** = \\((2191 - 2000)/2000 \\times 100 \\approx 9.55\\%\\) (Q21).\n\n#### **Newsvendor Model (Seasonal Demand)**:\n- **Optimal Order Quantity** (for Colony Shop):\n  - \\(C_u\\) = Understock cost = \\(110 - 50 = 60\\).\n  - \\(C_o\\) = Overstock cost = \\(50 - 55 = -5\\) (loss if unsold).\n  - **Critical Fractile** = \\(C_u / (C_u + C_o) = 60 / 55 \\approx 1.09\\) \u2192 Order at **maximum demand (30)**.\n  - *Answer*: 29\u201333 (Q22).\n\n### **C. Facility Layout & Production**\n#### **Types of Layouts**:\n1. **Product Layout**: Assembly lines (e.g., Ashoke Motors in Q7).\n2. **Process Layout**: Grouped by function (e.g., job shops).\n3. **Fixed-Position Layout**: Product remains stationary (e.g., shipbuilding).\n\n#### **Workstation Calculation**:\n- **Given**:\n  - Daily production = 24,000 bulbs.\n  - 2 shifts/day \u00d7 8 hours = 16 hours.\n  - Total activity time = 12 seconds.\n- **Cycle Time** = \\(16 \\times 3600 / 24000 = 2.4\\) sec/bulb.\n- **Theoretical Min Workstations** = \\(12 / 2.4 = 5\\) (Q8).\n\n#### **Euclidean Distance**:\n\\[\n\\text{Distance} = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\n\\]\n- Example: A(5,10), B(2,6) \u2192 \\(\\sqrt{(2-5)^2 + (6-10)^2} = 5\\) (Q9).\n\n### **D. Supply Chain & Logistics**\n#### **Distribution Network Costs**:\n- Affected by:\n  - Inventory.\n  - Transportation.\n  - Facilities/handling.\n  - Information (but **not price**).\n\n#### **Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) vs. TSP**:\n| **Feature**               | **VRP**                          | **TSP**               |\n|--------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------|\n| Capacity Restrictions    | Yes (e.g., truck load limits)   | No                    |\n| Subtour Elimination      | Yes                              | Yes                   |\n| Specific Starting Point  | Yes (e.g., depot)                | Optional              |\n\n#### **Decision Variables in VRP**:\n- \\(X_{i,j}\\) = Binary (1 if vehicle travels from \\(i\\) to \\(j\\), else 0).\n\n### **E. Dynamic Programming (Workforce Planning)**\n#### **Problem Setup** (Q14\u2013Q17):\n- **Stage**: Week (\\(t = 1\\) to \\(5\\)).\n- **State**: Workers at end of previous week (\\(W_{t-1}\\)).\n- **Decision**: Workers to hire/fire in week \\(t\\).\n- **Costs**:\n  - Hiring: \\(400 + 200 \\times \\text{new hires}\\).\n  - Excess labor: \\(300 \\times \\text{excess workers}\\).\n- **Objective**: Minimize total cost.\n- **Optimal Solution for Stage 5 (State = 4)**: **8** (Q17).\n\n### **F. Revenue Management (Flight Booking)**\n- **Business Class Demand**: Uniform [10, 40].\n- **Protection Level**: 70 seats (reserved for business class).\n- **Booking Limit**: 30 seats (economy class).\n\n### **G.
