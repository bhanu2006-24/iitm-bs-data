Core Topics & Concepts**\n### **A. Industrial Revolutions**\n- **1st Revolution (1760-1840)**: Mechanization (steam engine, textiles).\n  *Country*: **England**.\n- **2nd Revolution (1870-1914)**: Mass production (electricity, assembly lines).\n  *Country*: **USA**.\n- **3rd Revolution (1960s)**: Automation (computers, electronics).\n  *Countries*: **USA/Japan**.\n- **4th Revolution (Present)**: Cyber-physical systems (IoT, AI, big data).\n  *Country*: **Germany** (Industrie 4.0 initiative).\n\n### **B. Facility Layouts**\n| **Layout Type**       | **Description**                                                                 | **Best Use Case**                          |\n|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| **Product Layout**    | Sequential arrangement for high-volume, standardized products.                 | Assembly lines (e.g., cars).              |\n| **Group Layout**      | Machines grouped by product families (cellular manufacturing).                | Customized products with shared components (e.g., headsets). |\n| **Fixed Position**    | Product remains stationary; tools/machines move to it.                         | Large/heavy products (e.g., ships, planes).|\n| **Process Layout**    | Machines grouped by function (e.g., all lathes together).                     | Job shops, low-volume, high-variety.     |\n\n**Key Principle**:\n- **Group Layout** is optimal when products share components but require customization (e.g., Geet Mobile\u2019s headsets).\n\n---\n\n### **C. Forecasting Methods**\n#### **1. Exponential Smoothing (Holt\u2019s Linear Trend Model)**\n**Equations**:\n1. **Forecast for next period**:\n   \\( F_{t+1} = a_t + b_t \\)\n2. **Smoothed level** (\\( a_t \\)):\n   \\( a_t = \\alpha D_t + (1 - \\alpha)(a_{t-1} + b_{t-1}) \\)\n3. **Smoothed trend** (\\( b_t \\)):\n   \\( b_t = \\beta (a_t - a_{t-1}) + (1 - \\beta) b_{t-1} \\)\n\n**Parameters**:\n- \\( \\alpha \\): Smoothing factor for level (0 \u2264 \u03b1 \u2264 1).\n- \\( \\beta \\): Smoothing factor for trend (0 \u2264 \u03b2 \u2264 1).\n- \\( D_t \\): Actual demand at time \\( t \\).\n\n**Use Case**: Short-term forecasting with trend.\n\n#### **2. Time Series Forecasting Tasks**\n- **Identify patterns** (trend, seasonality, cyclicality).\n- **Discover relationships** among variables (e.g., demand vs. promotions).\n\n**Seasonal Patterns**:\n- **Examples**:\n  - Increased ceiling fan sales in **summer** (not winter).\n  - Tourist footfall during **holidays/year-end**.\n\n---\n\n### **D. Digitization vs. Digitalization**\n| **Term**       | **Definition**                                                                 | **Example**                                  |\n|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n| **Digitization** | Converting physical data to digital format.                                  | Scanning a book (Google Lens), CAD drawings.|\n| **Digitalization** | Using digital data to transform processes (automation, analytics).          | Automated sales reports (not digitization). |\n\n---\n\n### **E. Internet Types by Application**\n| **Application**               | **Internet Type**       |\n|-------------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Smart metering                 | Industrial (IoT)        |\n| Banking systems                | Commercial              |\n| Entertainment devices         | Consumer                |\n\n---\n\n### **F. Facility Location & Layout Optimization**\n#### **1. Euclidean Method for Facility Location**\n- **Optimal Solution**:\n  - Results in a **point** (not a region).\n  - Rarely matches the **center of gravity** (unless demands are uniform).\n- **Cross-Median Approach**:\n  - Find the median of \\( x \\)-coordinates and \\( y \\)-coordinates separately.\n  - **Example**: For demand points at A(1,2), B(2,3), C(3,5), D(4,1) with demands 7,1,3,5:\n    - **Optimal Locations**: (2,2), (3,2), (2.5,2).\n\n#### **2. Purposes of Facility Layout**\n- Minimize material handling delays.\n- Enhance sales (retail/service layouts).\n- Enable easy maintenance.\n\n---\n\n### **G. Supply Chain & Logistics**\n#### **1. Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) vs. TSP**\n| **Feature**               | **VRP**                          | **TSP**                     |\n|---------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| **Capacity Restrictions** | Yes (e.g., truck load limits).    | No.                         |\n| **Starting Point**        | Fixed (e.g., warehouse).          | Any node.                   |\n| **Subtour Elimination**   | Yes (prevent loops).              | Yes.                        |\n| **Distance Restrictions** | Often considered.                | Only total distance.        |\n\n#### **2. Distribution Network Costs**\nAffected by network structure:\n- **Inventory** (holding costs).\n- **Transportation** (shipping).\n- **Facilities/Handling** (warehousing).\n- **Information** (IT systems).\n\n#### **3. Outsourcing Demerits**\n- Loss of **supply chain visibility**.\n- **Leakage of sensitive data**.\n- **Reduced customer/supplier contact**.\n- **Over-dependence on third parties**.\n\n---\n\n### **H. Production & Inventory Management**\n#### **1. Economic Order Quantity (EOQ)**\n**Equation**:\n\\( EOQ = \\sqrt{\\frac{2DS}{H}} \\)\nWhere:\n- \\( D \\): Annual demand (80,000 units).\n- \\( S \\): Ordering cost (Rs. 1,200).\n- \\( H \\): Holding cost per unit (6% of Rs. 50 = Rs. 3).\n\n**Calculations** (Limat Ltd. example):\n- \\( EOQ = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\times 80,000 \\times 1,200}{3}} = 8,000 \\) units.\n- **Number of orders/year**: \\( \\frac{80,000}{8,000} = 10 \\).\n- **Annual order cost**: \\( 10 \\times 1,200 = 12,000 \\).\n- **Annual carrying cost**: \\( \\frac{8,000}{2} \\times 3 = 12,000 \\).\n\n#### **2. Line Balancing (Workstations)**\n**Given**:\n- Total production time: 24,000 bulbs \u00d7 12 sec = 288,000 sec.\n- Available time: 2 shifts \u00d7 8 hours \u00d7 3,600 sec = 57,600 sec/day.\n- **Cycle time**: \\( \\frac{57,600}{24,000} = 2.4 \\) sec/bulb.\n- **Minimum workstations**: \\( \\frac{12}{2.4} = 5 \\).\n\n---\n\n### **I. Revenue Management (Flight Booking)**\n**Given**:\n- Total seats: 100.\n- **Economy**: Rs. 2,500/seat.\n- **Business**: Rs. 7,500/seat (demand ~ Uniform[10,20]).\n- **Protection level**: 100 - booking limit = 83.\n- **Booking limit**: 17 (to maximize revenue).\n\n---\n\n### **J.
