        "summary": "Here\u2019s a structured **summary of core topics, concepts, principles, and equations** for the **Financial Forensics (Computer-Based Exam)** based on the question paper, followed by **Mermaid knowledge graphs** to visualize relationships.\n\n---\n\n---\n\n### **Core Topics & Concepts**\n#### **1. Financial Accounting & Reporting**\n- **Balance Sheet**:\n  - Reports assets, liabilities, and stockholders' equity at a **point in time** (not over a period).\n  - Equation: **Assets = Liabilities + Stockholders' Equity**.\n  - **Retained Earnings** must match the ending balance in the **Statement of Stockholders' Equity**.\n  - **Contingent Liabilities**:\n    - If a lawsuit is **possible but not probable**, disclose in **footnotes** (not on the balance sheet).\n    - If **probable and estimable**, record as a liability.\n\n- **Cash Flow Statement**:\n  - **Operating Activities**: Includes cash from customers, collections from receivables, and unearned revenue.\n  - **Investing Activities**: Purchase/sale of long-term assets (e.g., land, equipment). **Does not include inventory or short-term investments**.\n  - **Financing Activities**: Not directly tested here.\n\n- **Financial Ratios**:\n  - **Return on Assets (ROA)**:\n    \\[\n    ROA = \\frac{\\text{Net Income}}{\\text{Average Total Assets}}\n    \\]\n    - If **average assets increase** (with other variables constant), ROA **decreases**.\n  - **Net Profit Margin**:\n    \\[\n    \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\frac{\\text{Net Income}}{\\text{Net Sales}}\n    \\]\n    - Increases if **sales rise without proportional expense increases** (e.g., successful advertising).\n\n---\n\n#### **2. Time Value of Money (TVM)**\n- **Present Value (PV) of Future Cash Flows**:\n  \\[\n  PV = \\sum \\frac{CF_t}{(1 + r)^t}\n  \\]\n  - Example: Salary offer discounted at 6.5% (Q8).\n  - **NPV Rule**: Accept projects with **NPV \u2265 0**.\n    - For **mutually exclusive projects**, choose the one with **higher NPV** (Q9).\n\n- **Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC)**:\n  \\[\n  WACC = \\left(\\frac{D}{V} \\times k_d \\times (1 - T)\\right) + \\left(\\frac{E}{V} \\times k_e\\right)\n  \\]\n  - \\(D/V\\) = Debt-to-Value ratio, \\(E/V\\) = Equity-to-Value ratio.\n  - Given \\(WACC = 9.5\\%\\), \\(k_d = 6.5\\%\\), \\(k_e = 12.75\\%\\), solve for **debt-equity ratio** (Q10):\n    \\[\n    9.5\\% = \\left(\\frac{D}{E} \\times 6.5\\% \\times 1\\right) + \\left(1 \\times 12.75\\% \\times \\frac{E}{E}\\right) \\implies \\frac{D}{E} = 1.08\n    \\]\n\n- **Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)**:\n  \\[\n  E(R_i) = R_f + \\beta_i (E(R_m) - R_f)\n  \\]\n  - Example: \\(R_f = 3.84\\%\\), \\(\\beta = 0.75\\), \\(E(R_m) - R_f = 7.78\\%\\) \u2192 \\(E(R_i) = 9.68\\%\\) (Q11).\n\n---\n\n#### **3. Risk & Model Performance**\n- **Population Stability Index (PSI)**:\n  - Measures **distribution shift** between training and deployment data.\n  - **PSI > 0.25**: Significant shift \u2192 **retrain model** (Q19, Q20).\n  - Formula:\n    \\[\n    PSI = \\sum (\\text{Actual\\%} - \\text{Expected\\%}) \\times \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\text{Actual\\%}}{\\text{Expected\\%}}\\right)\n    \\]\n\n- **Confusion Matrix Metrics**:\n  - **Profit Calculation** (Q14):\n    - True Positives (TP): \\(187 \\times \u20b912,000 = \u20b92,244,000\\)\n    - False Positives (FP): \\(63 \\times \u20b940,000 = \u20b92,520,000\\) (loss)\n    - **Net Profit**: \\(\u20b92,244,000 - \u20b92,520,000 = -\u20b9276,000\\).\n  - **False Positives**: Predicted as class 1 but actually class 0 (Q15: **152**).\n  - **F1 Score** (Q24):\n    \\[\n    F1 = 2 \\times \\frac{\\text{Precision} \\times \\text{Recall}}{\\text{Precision} + \\text{Recall}} = 60.7\\%\n    \\]\n\n- **Delinquency Buckets** (Q21):\n  - **0\u201329 DPD**: Missed 1 payment (Joey missed 6th month but paid 5th).\n\n- **Model Selection for Business Problems**:\n  - **Fraud Detection**: Prioritize **Precision** (minimize false positives to avoid blocking genuine users) (Q22).\n  - **Savings Calculation** (Q23):\n    - Insufficient info (need **true positives/negatives** to compute savings).\n\n---\n\n#### **4. Text Processing & NLP**\n- **Lemmatization vs. Stemming**:\n  - **Lemmatization**: Converts words to **base/dictionary form** (e.g., \"integrated\" \u2192 \"integrate\") (Q12, Q13).\n  - **Stemming**: Crude chopping (e.g., \"integrated\" \u2192 \"integr\").\n- **Term Frequency (TF)**:\n  - Count of a word in a document (Q32: \"logo\" appears **3 times** in D1 + D2).\n- **String Similarity**:\n  - **Cosine Similarity**: Measures angle between vectors (higher = more similar) (Q34\u2013Q36).\n  - **Levenshtein Distance**: Edit distance between strings (Q33).\n\n---\n\n#### **5. Time Series Analysis**\n- **Autoregressive (AR) Models**:\n  - **AR(3) Equation** (Q30):\n    \\[\n    X_t = \\beta_1 X_{t-1} + \\beta_2 X_{t-2} + \\beta_3 X_{t-3} + \\epsilon_t\n    \\]\n  - **Differencing**: Removes **trend + seasonality** (Q27).\n  - **ACF/PACF Plots**:\n    - **ACF**: Correlation between \\(X_t\\) and \\(X_{t-k}\\).\n    - **PACF**: Correlation **controlling for intermediate lags** (Q28).\n    - **PACF** determines **AR order**; **ACF** determines **MA order**.\n\n- **Model Evaluation**:\n  - Metrics: **MSE, MAE, MAPE** (Q29).\n  - **MSE Comparison** (Q31):\n    - Model A: MSE = \\([(7-10)^2 + (11-12)^2 + ... + (30-23)^2]/7 = 20.29\\)\n    - Model B: MSE = \\([(10-10)^2 + (11-12)^2 + ... + (23-23)^2]/7 = 17.14\\)\n    - **Lower MSE \u2192 Model B is better** (but answer says A; likely a miscalculation).\n\n---\n\n#### **6. Anomaly Detection & Explainability**\n- **Isolation Forest**:\n  - Anomalies are **easily separable** points (Q26: **TRUE**).\n- **SHAP Values**:\n  - **Global Explainability**: Feature importance across all data (Q37).\n  - **Waterfall Plots**: Show feature contributions to a prediction (Q38: **base value = 2.059**).\n  - **TreeExplainer Default**: Uses **tree_path_dependent** perturbation (Q39).\n\n---\n\n#### **7. Probability & Statistics**\n- **Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)** for Normal Distribution (Q25):\n  - Given data \\(X = [10, 15, ..., 11]\\):\n    \\[\n    \\mu_{MLE} = \\bar{X} = 14.5, \\quad \\sigma_{MLE}^2 = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum (X_i - \\mu)^2 \\approx 7.51^2\n    \\]\n- **Roll Rates** (Q16\u2013Q18):\n  - **Rollback Rate**: % of accounts improving (e.g., 75.46% for \"0\u201329 DPD\" \u2192 \"No Due\").\n  - **Roll Forward Rate**: % worsening (e.g., 13.43% for \"No Due\" \u2192 \"0\u201329 DPD\").\n\n---\n\n---\n\n### **Mermaid Knowledge Graphs**\n#### **1.
