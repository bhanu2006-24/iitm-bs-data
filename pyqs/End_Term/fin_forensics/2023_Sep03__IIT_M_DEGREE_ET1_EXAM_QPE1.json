Portfolio Theory & Beta**\n- **Portfolio Beta**:\n  \\[\n  \\beta_p = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i \\beta_i\n  \\]\n  where \\(w_i\\) = Weight of asset \\(i\\) in the portfolio.\n- **Desired Portfolio Beta Adjustment**:\n  - If adding a **risk-free asset** (beta = 0), solve for the allocation to achieve target beta.\n\n---\n\n## **2. Financial Accounting & Forensics**\n### **Core Topics & Concepts**\n#### **A. Financial Statements Analysis**\n- **Profitability Ratios**:\n  - **Gross Margin** = \\(\\frac{\\text{Gross Profit}}{\\text{Revenue}}\\) \u00d7 100,\n  - **Earnings Per Share (EPS)** = \\(\\frac{\\text{Net Income}}{\\text{Shares Outstanding}}\\).\n- **Cash Flow Statement**:\n  - **Investing Activities**: Purchase/sale of assets (land, equipment, investments).\n  - **Operating Activities**: Revenue, expenses, working capital changes.\n  - **Financing Activities**: Dividends, stock issuance, debt repayment.\n\n#### **B. Error Detection in Accounting**\n- **Capital vs. Revenue Expenditure**:\n  - **Capital Expenditure** (CapEx): Long-term asset purchases (e.g., equipment).\n  - **Revenue Expenditure** (RevEx): Short-term expenses (e.g., repairs).\n  - **Misclassification Impact**:\n    - If CapEx is recorded as RevEx \u2192 **Understated Assets & Overstated Expenses** \u2192 **Lower Net Income**.\n\n#### **C. Tax Treatment**\n- **Excess Tax Payment**: Recorded as **Prepaid Expense (Current Asset)**.\n\n---\n\n## **3. Machine Learning & Data Science for Finance**\n### **Core Topics & Concepts**\n#### **A. Text Preprocessing (NLP)**\n- **Tokenization**: Splitting text into words/tokens.\n- **Stopword Removal**: Removing common words (e.g., \"the\", \"is\").\n- **Stemming**: Reducing words to root form (e.g., \"running\" \u2192 \"run\").\n- **Lemmatization**: Reducing words to dictionary form (e.g., \"better\" \u2192 \"good\").\n- **Term Frequency (TF)**:\n  \\[\n  TF(t, d) = \\frac{\\text{Number of times term } t \\text{ appears in document } d}{\\text{Total terms in } d}\n  \\]\n\n#### **B. Classification Metrics**\n- **Confusion Matrix**:\n  |                | Predicted + | Predicted - |\n  |----------------|--------------|--------------|\n  | **Actual +**   | TP           | FN           |\n  | **Actual -**   | FP           | TN           |\n\n- **Profit Calculation from Confusion Matrix**:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Profit} = (TP \\times \\text{Profit per TP}) - (FP \\times \\text{Loss per FP})\n  \\]\n- **Precision, Recall, F1-Score**:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Precision} = \\frac{TP}{TP + FP}, \\quad \\text{Recall} = \\frac{TP}{TP + FN}\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  F1 = 2 \\times \\frac{\\text{Precision} \\times \\text{Recall}}{\\text{Precision} + \\text{Recall}}\n  \\]\n- **Population Stability Index (PSI)**:\n  - Measures **feature drift** between training and production data.\n  - **Formula**:\n    \\[\n    PSI = \\sum (\\text{Actual \\%} - \\text{Expected \\%}) \\times \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\text{Actual \\%}}{\\text{Expected \\%}}\\right)\n    \\]\n\n#### **C. Fraud Detection & Anomaly Detection**\n- **Supervised vs. Unsupervised Learning**:\n  - **Supervised**: Requires labeled fraud/non-fraud data (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest).\n  - **Unsupervised**: Detects anomalies without labels (e.g., Isolation Forest, Autoencoders).\n- **Isolation Forest**:\n  - **Outliers are easy to isolate** (fewer splits needed).\n  - **No need to remove outliers beforehand** (they are the anomalies).\n\n#### **D. Time Series Analysis**\n- **Stationarity & Dickey-Fuller Test**:\n  - **Null Hypothesis (H\u2080)**: Time series has a **unit root** (non-stationary).\n  - **Alternative Hypothesis (H\u2081)**: Time series is **stationary**.\n  - **p-value < 0.05** \u2192 Reject H\u2080 (stationary).\n- **Autocorrelation Function (ACF)**:\n  - Measures correlation between \\(Y_t\\) and \\(Y_{t-k}\\) (lagged values).\n- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**:\n  \\[\n  MSE = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (Y_i - \\hat{Y}_i)^2\n  \\]\n- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**:\n  \\[\n  RMSE = \\sqrt{MSE}\n  \\]\n\n#### **E.

Performance Metrics for Regression**\n- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**:\n  \\[\n  MAE = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} |Y_i - \\hat{Y}_i|\n  \\]\n- **R\u00b2 (R-Squared)**:\n  \\[\n  R^2 = 1 - \\frac{SS_{res}}{SS_{tot}}\n  \\]\n  where \\(SS_{res} = \\sum (Y_i - \\hat{Y}_i)^2\\) and \\(SS_{tot} = \\sum (Y_i - \\bar{Y})^2\\).\n\n#### **G. String Similarity**\n- **Cosine Similarity**:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Cosine Similarity} = \\frac{A \\cdot B}{\\|A\\| \\|B\\|}\n  \\]\n  where \\(A \\cdot B\\) is the dot product, and \\(\\|A\\|\\) is the magnitude of vector \\(A\\).\n- **Levenshtein Distance**: Minimum edits (insertions, deletions, substitutions) to change one string to another.\n\n#### **H. Credit Risk & Roll Rates**\n- **Roll Rate**: Percentage of accounts moving from one delinquency bucket to another (e.g., 30-59 DPD \u2192 60-89 DPD).\n- **Capture Rate**: Cumulative percentage of \"events\" (e.g., defaults) captured in top deciles.\n- **Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) Statistic**:\n  - Measures **separation** between \"events\" and \"non-events\".\n  - **Higher KS** \u2192 Better model discrimination.\n\n---\n\n## **4.
