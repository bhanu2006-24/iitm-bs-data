        "summary": "Here\u2019s a structured **summary of core topics, concepts, and principles** for the **\"Qualifier: Aptitude\"** exam, along with a **Mermaid knowledge graph** to visualize relationships.\n\n---\n\n### **Core Topics & Concepts**\n#### **1. Logical Reasoning & Puzzles**\n- **Direction Sense**: Movement in cardinal directions (N/S/E/W) with turns.\n  - Example: Anil\u2019s walking path (Q2).\n- **Family Relations**: Blood relations (siblings, parents, cousins).\n  - Example: Family tree (Q8).\n- **Seating Arrangement/Positioning**:\n  - Rank-based positioning (left/right) (Q3).\n- **Venn Diagrams/Set Theory**:\n  - Overlapping sets (Teachers/Students/Authors) (Q6).\n- **Coding-Decoding**:\n  - Letter substitution (e.g., ONLINE \u2192 LMORMV) (Q7, Q12).\n- **Syllogism**:\n  - Logical deductions from statements (e.g., \"All cats are dogs\") (Q10).\n\n#### **2. Mathematical Aptitude**\n- **Arithmetic**:\n  - **Leap Years**: Rules (divisible by 4, 100, 400) (Q4).\n  - **Time Calculations**: Scheduling (e.g., interview timing) (Q5).\n  - **Page Number Summation**: Missing page in a book (Q11).\n- **Algebra**:\n  - **System of Equations**: Solving for 2 variables (sum/product) (Q15).\n- **Mixtures & Ratios**:\n  - **Replacement Problems**: Liquid ratios after replacements (Q13).\n- **Progressions**:\n  - **Frog\u2019s Well Problem**: Net progress per jump (20 cm up, 6 cm down) (Q14).\n- **Percentages**:\n  - **Marriage Statistics**: % of married adults (Q16).\n\n#### **3. Data Interpretation & Scheduling**\n- **Calendar Problems**:\n  - Day of the week given a leap year (Q9).\n- **Scheduling Constraints**:\n  - Restaurant operations (lunch/dinner, polishing/watering) (Q17\u2013Q21).\n  - Non-consecutive days, mutual exclusivity (e.g., no polishing + watering on same day).\n\n#### **4. Verbal Reasoning**\n- **Statement-Conclusion**:\n  - Validating conclusions from premises (Q10).\n- **Word Coding**:\n  - Deciphering language rules (Q7, Q12).\n\n---\n\n### **Key Equations & Rules**\n1. **Leap Year Rule**:\n   - Divisible by 4 **but not** by 100 (unless also divisible by 400).\n   - *Example*: 1900 is **not** a leap year (Q4).\n\n2. **Net Progress (Frog\u2019s Well)**:\n   - Net gain per jump = `20 cm (up) - 6 cm (down) = 14 cm`.\n   - Total jumps = `(Total height - Initial jump) / Net gain + 1`.\n   - *Equation*: \\( \\text{Jumps} = \\frac{500 - 20}{14} + 1 = 36 \\) (Q14).\n\n3. **Mixture Ratio (Replacement)**:\n   - After 2 replacements of 4L in 16L:\n     - Remaining liquid S = \\( 16 \\times \\left(1 - \\frac{4}{16}\\right)^2 = 9 \\)L.\n     - Ratio L:S = `7:9` (Q13).\n\n4. **Married Population %**:\n   - Let \\( M = \\text{men}, W = \\text{women} \\).\n   - Married men = 50% of \\( M \\), married women = 40% of \\( W \\).\n   - Since marriages are 1:1, \\( 0.5M = 0.4W \\).\n   - Total married = \\( 0.5M + 0.4W = 0.8W \\) (if \\( M = 0.8W \\)).\n   - % married = \\( \\frac{0.8W}{M + W} \\times 100 = 44.\\overline{4}\\% \\) (Q16).\n\n5. **Page Number Sum**:\n   - Sum of first \\( n \\) pages = \\( \\frac{n(n+1)}{2} \\).\n   - Torn page sum = \\( \\text{Total sum} - 44 = 5 + 6 = 11 \\) (Q11).\n\n6. **Direction to Coordinates**:\n   - South-East implies initial direction was **East** (Q2).\n\n---\n\n### **Mermaid Knowledge Graphs**\n#### **Graph 1: Logical Reasoning & Puzzles**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Logical Reasoning] --> B[Direction Sense]\n    A --> C[Family Relations]\n    A --> D[Seating Arrangement]\n    A --> E[Venn Diagrams]\n    A --> F[Coding-Decoding]\n    A --> G[Syllogism]\n\n    B --> H[\"Cardinal Directions\\n(N/S/E/W)\"]\n    B --> I[\"Turns (Left/Right)\"]\n    C --> J[\"Siblings, Parents, Cousins\"]\n    D --> K[\"Rank-Based Positioning\"]\n    E --> L[\"Overlapping Sets\\n(Teachers/Students/Authors)\"]\n    F --> M[\"Letter Substitution\\n(ONLINE \u2192 LMORMV)\"]\n    G --> N[\"Premise \u2192 Conclusion\\n(All cats are dogs)\"]\n```\n\n#### **Graph 2: Mathematical Aptitude**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Mathematical Aptitude] --> B[Arithmetic]\n    A --> C[Algebra]\n    A --> D[Mixtures & Ratios]\n    A --> E[Progressions]\n    A --> F[Percentages]\n\n    B --> G[\"Leap Years\\n(divisible by 4/100/400)\"]\n    B --> H[\"Time Calculations\\n(Interview Scheduling)\"]\n    B --> I[\"Page Summation\\n(Torn Page)\"]\n    C --> J[\"System of Equations\\n(Sum/Product)\"]\n    D --> K[\"Replacement Problems\\n(Liquid Ratios)\"]\n    E --> L[\"Frog's Well\\n(Net Progress)\"]\n    F --> M[\"Marriage Statistics\\n(44.44% Married)\"]\n```\n\n#### **Graph 3: Data Interpretation & Scheduling**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Data Interpretation] --> B[Calendar Problems]\n    A --> C[Scheduling Constraints]\n\n    B --> D[\"Day of Week\\n(Leap Year)\"]\n    C --> E[\"Restaurant Operations\\n(Lunch/Dinner)\"]\n    C --> F[\"Polishing/Watering\\n(Non-Consecutive Days)\"]\n    C --> G[\"Mutual Exclusivity\\n(No Polishing + Watering)\"]\n```\n\n#### **Graph 4: Verbal Reasoning**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Verbal Reasoning] --> B[Statement-Conclusion]\n    A --> C[Word Coding]\n\n    B --> D[\"Validating Conclusions\\n(All cats are dogs \u2192 ?)\"]\n    C --> E[\"Deciphering Rules\\n(lo ka pi bi = ?)\"]\n```\n\n---\n### **Exam Preparation Tips**\n1. **Practice Direction Sense**: Draw diagrams for movement problems (Q2).\n2. **Master Venn Diagrams**: Use set theory for overlapping categories (Q6).\n3. **Memorize Leap Year Rules**: Quickly identify non-leap years (Q4).\n4. **Solve Mixture Problems**: Use replacement formulas (Q13).\n5. **Calendar Calculations**: Count days from a reference date (Q9).\n6. **Logical Deduction**: Eliminate invalid conclusions (Q10).\n7. **Scheduling Constraints**: Use tables for restaurant problems (Q17\u2013Q21).",
