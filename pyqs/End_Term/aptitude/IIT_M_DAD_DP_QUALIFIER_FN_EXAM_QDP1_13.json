        "summary": "Here\u2019s a structured **summary of core topics, concepts, and equations** for the exam, followed by **Mermaid knowledge graphs** to visualize relationships.\n\n---\n\n### **1. Core Topics & Concepts**\n#### **A. Logical Reasoning & Puzzles**\n- **Directional Problems** (e.g., Q2):\n  - Cardinal directions (North, South, East, West).\n  - Right/left turns and relative positioning.\n- **Blood Relations** (e.g., Q4):\n  - Family tree diagrams (father, son, brother, uncle).\n  - Decoding statements like *\"His father is the only son of my father\"* \u2192 Suresh is the father.\n- **Coding-Decoding** (e.g., Q7):\n  - Letter shifting (e.g., CAT \u2192 DBU: each letter +1).\n  - Pattern recognition (e.g., MOUSE \u2192 NPVTF: M\u2192N, O\u2192P, U\u2192V, S\u2192T, E\u2192F).\n- **Syllogism** (e.g., Q8, Q9):\n  - Venn diagrams for statements like *\"All Bats are Rats\"* or *\"Some Potatoes are Carrots.\"*\n  - Validating conclusions (e.g., *\"No snakes are bats\"* \u2192 Conclusion III is valid).\n- **Arrangement Puzzles** (e.g., Q17\u2013Q21):\n  - Stacking/sequencing with constraints (e.g., *\"Box A is above Box C\"*).\n  - Eliminating options based on conditions (e.g., *\"Papaya is below Banana\"*).\n\n#### **B. Mathematics**\n- **Average Speed** (e.g., Q3):\n  - Formula:\n    \\[\n    \\text{Average Speed} = \\frac{\\text{Total Distance}}{\\text{Total Time}}\n    \\]\n    Example: \\((60 \\times 2 + 40 \\times 3) / (2 + 3) = 48\\) mph.\n- **Work Rate** (e.g., Q10):\n  - Combined work rate:\n    \\[\n    \\frac{1}{T} = \\frac{1}{T_A} + \\frac{1}{T_B} \\quad \\text{(e.g., } \\frac{1}{12} + \\frac{1}{18} = \\frac{5}{36} \\Rightarrow T = 7.2 \\text{ days)}\n    \\]\n- **Ratios & Ages** (e.g., Q6, Q11):\n  - Solving linear equations from ratios:\n    - Q6: \\(p = q + 3\\), \\(q = 6\\) \u2192 \\(B = 3p + 2q = 39\\).\n    - Q11: Let ages be \\(5x, 7x, 9x\\). After 5 years: \\(5x + 7x + 9x + 15 = 120\\) \u2192 \\(x = 3\\), so \\(C = 27 + 5 = 32\\) (but answer is 45; recheck).\n- **Profit & Loss** (e.g., Q14):\n  - Profit percentage:\n    \\[\n    \\text{Profit} = \\frac{\\text{SP} - \\text{CP}}{\\text{CP}} \\times 100\\%\n    \\]\n    Given 25% profit on CP of 15 chocolates = SP of \\(n\\) chocolates:\n    \\[\n    1.25 \\times \\text{CP}_{15} = \\text{SP}_n \\Rightarrow n = 12\n    \\]\n- **Algebraic Operations** (e.g., Q13):\n  - Decoding symbols (\\(\\otimes, \\boxminus, \\triangle\\)) as \\(+, -, \\times, \\div\\).\n  - Example: \\(8 \\otimes 4 \\boxminus 9 = 44\\) \u2192 Likely \\(8 \\times 4 + 9 = 41\\) (doesn\u2019t fit). Alternative: \\(8 \\times 4 + (9 \\times 1) = 41\\) (inconsistent). **Answer is 13**, suggesting \\(\\otimes = \\times\\), \\(\\triangle = -\\), \\(\\boxminus = +\\):\n    \\[\n    10 \\times 15 - 5 = 145 \\quad (\\text{Not 13. Re-evaluate.})\n    \\]\n    *Clarification needed.*\n- **Combinatorics** (e.g., Q5):\n  - Derangements: Exactly one correct letter in envelopes is possible (e.g., ADCB), but exactly one incorrect is impossible (others must also be incorrect).\n- **Geometry** (e.g., Q16):\n  - Painted cube division: For a \\(3 \\times 3 \\times 3\\) cube, small cubes with **2 painted faces** are on edges but not corners:\n    \\[\n    12 \\text{ edges} \\times (3 - 2) \\text{ cubes/edge} = 12\n    \\]\n\n#### **C. Data Interpretation**\n- **Averages** (e.g., Q12):\n  - New average with added data point:\n    \\[\n    \\text{Teacher's weight} = 11 \\times 46 - 10 \\times 45 = 56 \\text{ kg}\n    \\]\n- **Digit Problems** (e.g., Q15):\n  - Two-digit numbers: \\(AB + CD = 183\\) where \\(A,B,C,D\\) are distinct (1\u20139).\n    Solution: \\(97 + 86 = 183\\) \u2192 Sum of digits \\(9 + 7 + 8 + 6 = 30\\).\n\n---\n\n### **2.

Exam Tips**\n1. **Directional Problems**: Draw a diagram to track movements (e.g., Q2: East \u2192 Right \u2192 South-East).\n2. **Syllogism**: Draw Venn diagrams for each statement before evaluating conclusions.\n3. **Work Rate**: Always invert individual times to add rates (e.g., \\(1/12 + 1/18\\)).\n4. **Coding-Decoding**: Check for consistent patterns (e.g., +1 shift for each letter).\n5. **Painted Cubes**: Memorize the formula for 2-faced cubes: \\(12 \\times (n - 2)\\).\n6. **Profit & Loss**: Ensure CP and SP are clearly distinguished (Q14: CP of 15 = SP of 12).\n7. **Arrangement Puzzles**: List constraints vertically and eliminate options step-by-step.",
