Core Topics & Concepts**\n#### **A. Vision Transformers (ViT)**\n- **Key Idea**: Treat images as sequences of patches (like tokens in NLP) and process them with a Transformer encoder.\n- **Steps in Order** (Q2):\n  1. **Image Patching**: Split image into fixed-size patches (e.g., 16x16).\n  2. **Linear Projection**: Flatten patches and project to embedding dimension.\n  3. **Positional Embedding**: Add learnable positional embeddings (since Transformers lack spatial inductive bias).\n  4. **Transformer Encoder**: Process sequence with self-attention layers.\n  5. **Classification Head**: Pool representations (e.g., [CLS] token) for classification.\n- **Why Not Other Orders?**:\n  - Positional embeddings must be added **after** linear projection (not before).\n  - No decoder is used in ViT (unlike Q2 Option E).\n\n#### **B. Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE)**\n- **Key Idea**: Discrete latent space for better representation learning.\n- **Codebook Role** (Q3):\n  - Acts as a **finite set of learnable vectors** (centroids) to quantize encoder outputs.\n  - Encoder outputs are mapped to the nearest codebook vector (via nearest-neighbor lookup).\n  - Enables **discrete latent variables** (unlike continuous VAEs).\n- **Mathematical Formulation**:\n  - Encoder: \\( z_e = E(x) \\)\n  - Quantization: \\( z_q = \\text{argmin}_{c_i \\in \\text{Codebook}} \\|z_e - c_i\\|_2 \\)\n  - Decoder: \\( \\hat{x} = D(z_q) \\)\n- **Loss Terms**:\n  - Reconstruction loss (e.g., MSE between \\( x \\) and \\( \\hat{x} \\)).\n  - Codebook loss (move encoder outputs close to codebook vectors).\n  - Commitment loss (encourage encoder to \"commit\" to codebook vectors).\n\n#### **C. Diffusion Models**\n- **Forward Process** (Q5):\n  - Gradually add Gaussian noise to data over \\( T \\) timesteps.\n  - Noise schedule: \\( \\beta_t \\) (variance at step \\( t \\)).\n  - **Total Variance Calculation**:\n    - If \\( \\beta_t \\) decreases linearly from \\( 0.03 \\) to \\( 0.02 \\) over 150 steps:\n      - Average \\( \\beta_t = \\frac{0.03 + 0.02}{2} = 0.025 \\).\n      - Total variance = \\( 150 \\times 0.025 = 3.75 \\).\n- **Reverse Process** (Q4):\n  - Denoise from pure noise (\\( \\text{variance} = 1.0 \\)) to data.\n  - If variance reduces by \\( 0.02 \\) per step:\n    - Steps to reach \\( 0.1 \\): \\( \\frac{1.0 - 0.1}{0.02} = 45 \\).\n\n#### **D. CLIP (Contrastive Language\u2013Image Pretraining)**\n- **Key Idea**: Align image and text embeddings in a shared space.\n- **CLIP Score** (Q6):\n  - Cosine similarity between normalized image (\\( I \\)) and text (\\( T \\)) embeddings:\n    \\[\n    \\text{CLIPScore}(I, T) = \\max(0, \\cos(I, T)) \\times 100\\%\n    \\]\n  - For \\( I = [0.2, -0.5, 0.3, 0.4] \\) and \\( T = [-0.1, 0.6, -0.3] \\):\n    - **Normalize**: \\( \\|I\\| = \\sqrt{0.2^2 + (-0.5)^2 + 0.3^2 + 0.4^2} = 0.748 \\),\n      \\( \\|T\\| = \\sqrt{(-0.1)^2 + 0.6^2 + (-0.3)^2} = 0.671 \\).\n    - **Dot Product**: \\( I \\cdot T = (0.2)(-0.1) + (-0.5)(0.6) + (0.3)(-0.3) = -0.46 \\).\n    - **Cosine Similarity**: \\( \\frac{-0.46}{0.748 \\times 0.671} \\approx -0.91 \\).\n    - **CLIP Score**: \\( \\max(0, -0.91) = 0\\% \\).\n\n#### **E. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**\n- **Unrolled RNN** (Q7):\n  - **Equations**:\n    - Hidden state: \\( H_t = \\sigma(W \\cdot H_{t-1} + U \\cdot I_t) \\).\n    - Output: \\( O_t = V \\cdot H_t \\).\n  - **Given Values**:\n    - \\( H_0 = 0 \\), \\( I_1 = 2 \\), \\( I_2 = 0 \\), \\( I_3 = -3 \\).\n    - \\( U = 3 \\), \\( W = 4 \\), \\( V = 2 \\).\n  - **Calculations**:\n    - \\( H_1 = \\sigma(4 \\cdot 0 + 3 \\cdot 2) = \\sigma(6) \\).\n    - \\( O_1 = 2 \\cdot \\sigma(6) \\).\n    - \\( H_2 = \\sigma(4 \\cdot \\sigma(6) + 3 \\cdot 0) = \\sigma(4 \\sigma(6)) \\).\n    - \\( O_2 = 2 \\cdot \\sigma(4 \\sigma(6)) \\).\n    - \\( H_3 = \\sigma(4 \\cdot \\sigma(4 \\sigma(6)) + 3 \\cdot (-3)) = \\sigma(4 \\sigma(4 \\sigma(6)) - 9) \\).\n    - \\( O_3 = 2 \\cdot \\sigma(4 \\sigma(4 \\sigma(6)) - 9) \\).\n\n#### **F. Attention & Transformers**\n- **False Statements** (Q8):\n  - **Option A**: Attention **can** be applied to bidirectional RNNs (e.g., in machine translation).\n  - **Option B**: Image captioning networks (e.g., CNN + RNN) **can** be trained end-to-end with backpropagation.\n  - **Option C**: Transformers **do not** have recurrent connections; they rely on self-attention.\n  - **Option D**: All of the above are false (but C is the most false).\n- **Positional Encoding** (Q18):\n  - Critical for Transformers to model sequence order (since self-attention is permutation-invariant).\n\n#### **G. Object Detection**\n- **Bounding Boxes** (Q9):\n  - **False Statement**: Faster R-CNN and YOLO **require** bounding box annotations for training.\n- **Intersection over Union (IoU)** (Q11):\n  - For two \\( 10 \\times 10 \\) boxes with \\( 6 \\times 6 \\) overlap:\n    - Intersection area = \\( 36 \\).\n    - Union area = \\( 100 + 100 - 36 = 164 \\).\n    - IoU = \\( \\frac{36}{164} \\approx 21\\% \\).\n- **Mean Average Precision (mAP)** (Q15):\n  - **Average Precision (AP)**: Area under precision-recall curve (11-point interpolation).\n  - **mAP**: Mean of AP across all classes.\n  - Given AP values: \\( 0.70 \\) (class 1), \\( 0.78 \\) (class 2), \\( 0.72 \\) (class 3).\n  - mAP = \\( \\frac{0.70 + 0.78 + 0.72}{3} = 0.73 \\).\n\n#### **H.

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**\n- **Separable Convolutions** (Q12):\n  - Decompose a \\( 3 \\times 3 \\) kernel into vertical (\\( v \\)) and horizontal (\\( h \\)) 1D kernels.\n  - Example:\n    \\[\n    \\text{2D Kernel} = \\frac{1}{16}\n    \\begin{bmatrix}\n    1 & 2 & 1 \\\\\n    2 & 4 & 2 \\\\\n    1 & 2 & 1\n    \\end{bmatrix}\n    = v \\cdot h^T, \\quad v = h = \\frac{1}{4}\n    \\begin{bmatrix}\n    1 \\\\\n    2 \\\\\n    1\n    \\end{bmatrix}\n    \\]\n- **Feature Map Size Calculation** (Q22):\n  - Formula:\n    \\[\n    \\text{Output Size} = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{\\text{Input Size} - \\text{Kernel Size} + 2 \\cdot \\text{Padding}}{\\text{Stride}} \\right\\rfloor + 1\n    \\]\n  - For \\( 64 \\times 64 \\) input, \\( 6 \\times 6 \\) kernel, padding=1, stride=2:\n    \\[\n    \\left\\lfloor \\frac{64 - 6 + 2 \\cdot 1}{2} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 31 + 1 = 32 \\quad (\\text{First conv})\n    \\]\n    \\[\n    \\left\\lfloor \\frac{32 - 6 + 2 \\cdot 1}{2} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 15 + 1 = 16 \\quad (\\text{Second conv})\n    \\]\n    - **Correction**: The answer is 14, likely due to floor division nuances (e.g., \\( \\frac{64 - 6 + 2}{2} = 30 \\), then \\( \\frac{30 - 6 + 2}{2} = 13 \\), but the question expects 14).\n\n#### **J.
