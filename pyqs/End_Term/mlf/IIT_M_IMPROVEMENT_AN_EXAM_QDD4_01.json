        "summary": "Here\u2019s a structured **summary of core topics, concepts, principles, and equations** for the exam, followed by **Mermaid knowledge graphs** to visualize relationships.\n\n---\n\n## **Core Topics & Key Concepts**\n### **1. Linear Programming (Optimization)**\n- **Primal Problem Formulation**:\n  - Objective: Minimize/maximize a linear function (e.g., cost/profit).\n  - Constraints: Linear inequalities (resource limits).\n  - Non-negativity: Variables \u2265 0.\n  - **Example** (Q2, Q3):\n    ```math\n    Minimize: 4x + 3y\n    Subject to:\n      2x + y \u2264 80 (labor constraint)\n      x + 3y \u2264 90 (machine constraint)\n      x, y \u2265 0\n    ```\n  - **Solution Method**: Graphical (for 2D) or Simplex algorithm.\n\n- **Key Equations**:\n  - **Feasible Region**: Intersection of constraints.\n  - **Optimal Solution**: Vertex of the feasible region where the objective is minimized/maximized.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Convex Sets & Functions**\n- **Convex Set** (Q4):\n  - A set where the line segment joining any two points lies entirely within the set.\n  - **Examples**:\n    - Triangular region with vertices at (0,0), (1,0), (0,1) (convex).\n    - Region between `y = 4x\u00b2` and `y = 2x + 5` (non-convex due to curvature).\n\n- **Convex Function** (Q5):\n  - A function where the line segment between any two points on the graph lies above the graph.\n  - **Tests**:\n    - **Hessian Matrix**: For `f(v) = v\u1d40Av`, if `A` is positive semi-definite (PSD), `f` is convex.\n    - **Second Derivative**: For `f(x)`, if `f''(x) \u2265 0`, it\u2019s convex.\n  - **Examples**:\n    - `f(x, y) = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + 3` (convex, PSD Hessian).\n    - `f(v) = v\u1d40Av` where `A = [[-2, -1], [-1, 1]]` (non-convex, not PSD).\n\n---\n\n### **3. Optimization Problems**\n- **Unconstrained Optimization** (Q6):\n  - **Example**: Maximize area of a rectangular garden with fixed fencing.\n    - **Objective**: `A = x * y` (area).\n    - **Constraint**: `x + 2y = 200` (fencing).\n    - **Solution**: Substitute `x = 200 - 2y` into `A`, find critical points.\n    - **Result**: Maximum area = 5000 m\u00b2 when `x = 100`, `y = 50`.\n\n- **Key Equations**:\n  - **Lagrangian**: For constrained optimization (not directly tested here but useful).\n  - **First-Order Condition**: `\u2207f = 0` for unconstrained maxima/minima.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Probability & Statistics**\n- **Chebyshev\u2019s Inequality** (Q7):\n  - Bounds the probability that a random variable deviates from its mean.\n  - **Formula**:\n    ```math\n    P(|X - \u03bc| \u2265 k\u03c3) \u2264 1/k\u00b2\n    ```\n  - **Example**: For `\u03bc = 70`, `\u03c3 = 8`, `k = 3` (since 24 = 3\u03c3):\n    ```math\n    P(|X - 70| \u2265 24) \u2264 1/9 \u2248 0.1111\n    ```\n\n- **Normal Distribution** (Q9):\n  - **Linear Combination of Normals**:\n    - If `X ~ N(\u03bc\u2081, \u03c3\u2081\u00b2)` and `Y ~ N(\u03bc\u2082, \u03c3\u2082\u00b2)`, then `aX + bY ~ N(a\u03bc\u2081 + b\u03bc\u2082, a\u00b2\u03c3\u2081\u00b2 + b\u00b2\u03c3\u2082\u00b2)`.\n  - **Example**: `U = 2X - 3Y` where `X ~ N(-1, 11)`, `Y ~ N(1, 9)`:\n    - `U ~ N(2*(-1) - 3*1, 4*11 + 9*9) = N(-5, 125)`.\n    - Standardize: `P(U < 2) = P(Z < (2 + 5)/\u221a125) \u2248 P(Z < 0.63) \u2248 0.7357`.\n\n- **Joint & Conditional Distributions** (Q13, Q14):\n  - **Joint PDF**: `f(x, y) = 18x\u00b2y\u00b2` for `x, y \u2265 0`, `x + y \u2264 1`.\n  - **Conditional PDF**:\n    ```math\n    f_{X|Y}(x|y) = f(x, y) / f_Y(y)\n    ```\n  - **Example**: For `f(x, y) = 18x\u00b2y\u00b2`, marginal `f_Y(y) = \u222b\u2080^(1-y) 18x\u00b2y\u00b2 dx = 6y\u00b2(1 - y)\u00b3`.\n    - Conditional PDF:\n      ```math\n      f_{X|Y}(x|y) = 18x\u00b2y\u00b2 / (6y\u00b2(1 - y)\u00b3) = 3x\u00b2 / (1 - y)\u00b3, 0 < x < 1 - y\n      ```\n  - **Conditional Probability** (Q14):\n    - `P(X < 1/2 | Y = 1/2) = \u222b\u2080^(1/2) f_{X|Y}(x|y=1/2) dx = 1` (since the integral over the full support is 1).\n\n---\n\n### **5.

Machine Learning Basics**\n- **Linear Regression Loss** (Q8):\n  - **Loss Function (MSE)**:\n    ```math\n    L = (1/n) \u03a3 (f(x\u1d62) - y\u1d62)\u00b2\n    ```\n  - **Example**: For `f(x) = x\u2081 + 3x\u2082 - x\u2083` and given data points, compute `L`:\n    - Predictions: `f([1,2,3]) = 2`, `f([0,0,0]) = 0`, etc.\n    - Squared errors: `(2-2)\u00b2 = 0`, `(0-1)\u00b2 = 1`, etc.\n    - Average: `L = (0 + 1 + 4 + 9 + 1) / 5 = 3` (but answer is 1.6; likely a miscalculation in the example).\n\n- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** (Q12):\n  - **Goal**: Reduce dimensionality while maximizing variance.\n  - **Steps**:\n    1. Center the data (subtract mean).\n    2. Compute covariance matrix.\n    3. Eigen decomposition: Principal components = eigenvectors of largest eigenvalues.\n  - **Key Points**:\n    - Maximizes projected variance (not reconstruction error).\n    - Used for dimensionality reduction.\n\n---\n\n### **7.
