        "summary": "Here\u2019s a structured **summary of core topics, concepts, principles, and equations** essential for the exam, followed by **Mermaid knowledge graphs** to visualize relationships.\n\n---\n\n## **Core Topics & Key Concepts**\n### **1. Linear Programming (Optimization)**\n- **Primal Problem Formulation**:\n  - Objective: Minimize/maximize a linear function (e.g., cost: \\(4x + 3y\\)).\n  - Constraints: Linear inequalities (e.g., \\(2x + y \\leq 80\\), \\(x + 3y \\leq 90\\)).\n  - Non-negativity: \\(x, y \\geq 0\\).\n- **Feasible Region**: Intersection of constraints (convex set).\n- **Optimal Solution**: Vertex of the feasible region (use **graphical method** or **simplex algorithm**).\n- **Key Equation**:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Minimize } c^T x \\quad \\text{subject to } Ax \\leq b, \\, x \\geq 0\n  \\]\n\n### **2. Convex Sets & Functions**\n- **Convex Set**: A set \\(S\\) where for any \\(x, y \\in S\\) and \\(\\lambda \\in [0,1]\\), \\(\\lambda x + (1-\\lambda)y \\in S\\).\n  - Examples: Triangles, epigraphs of convex functions, regions between convex curves.\n- **Convex Function**: Satisfies \\(f(\\lambda x + (1-\\lambda)y) \\leq \\lambda f(x) + (1-\\lambda)f(y)\\).\n  - **Tests**:\n    - Hessian matrix \\(H\\) is positive semi-definite (for twice-differentiable functions).\n    - For quadratic forms \\(f(v) = v^T A v\\), \\(A\\) must be positive semi-definite.\n  - **Key Examples**:\n    - \\(f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 + 3\\) (convex).\n    - \\(f(v) = v^T A v\\) where \\(A = \\begin{bmatrix} -2 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}\\) (not convex; check eigenvalues).\n\n### **3. Optimization in Geometry**\n- **Maximizing Area with Constraints**:\n  - Example: Fence problem (rectangle against a wall).\n  - **Steps**:\n    1. Define variables (e.g., length \\(L\\), width \\(W\\)).\n    2. Write constraint (e.g., \\(L + 2W = 200\\)).\n    3. Express area \\(A = L \\times W\\) in terms of one variable.\n    4. Find critical points using calculus (derivative = 0).\n  - **Key Equation**:\n    \\[\n    A = (200 - 2W) \\times W \\quad \\text{Max at } W = 50 \\Rightarrow A = 5000\n    \\]\n\n### **4. Probability & Statistics**\n- **Chebyshev\u2019s Inequality**:\n  - Bounds probability of deviation from mean:\n    \\[\n    P(|X - \\mu| \\geq k\\sigma) \\leq \\frac{1}{k^2}\n    \\]\n  - Example: For \\(k = 3\\), \\(\\mu = 70\\), \\(\\sigma = 8\\):\n    \\[\n    P(|X - 70| \\geq 24) \\leq \\frac{1}{3^2} = 0.111\n    \\]\n- **Normal Distribution**:\n  - Linear combinations of independent normals are normal.\n  - **Mean/Variance of \\(U = aX + bY\\)**:\n    \\[\n    \\mu_U = a\\mu_X + b\\mu_Y, \\quad \\sigma_U^2 = a^2\\sigma_X^2 + b^2\\sigma_Y^2\n    \\]\n  - **Standardization**:\n    \\[\n    P(U < c) = P\\left(Z < \\frac{c - \\mu_U}{\\sigma_U}\\right)\n    \\]\n- **Joint/Conditional Distributions**:\n  - **Marginal PDF**: Integrate joint PDF over other variable.\n  - **Conditional PDF**:\n    \\[\n    f_{X|Y}(x|y) = \\frac{f(x,y)}{f_Y(y)}\n    \\]\n  - Example: For \\(f(x,y) = 18x^2y^2\\):\n    \\[\n    f_Y(y) = \\int_0^{1-y} 18x^2y^2 \\, dx = 6y^2(1-y)^3\n    \\]\n    \\[\n    f_{X|Y}(x|y) = \\frac{18x^2y^2}{6y^2(1-y)^3} = \\frac{3x^2}{(1-y)^3}\n    \\]\n\n### **5. Linear Algebra**\n- **Eigenvalues/Eigenvectors**:\n  - For matrix \\(A\\), solve \\(\\det(A - \\lambda I) = 0\\).\n  - **Trace** = sum of eigenvalues, **Determinant** = product of eigenvalues.\n- **Diagonalizability**: \\(A\\) is diagonalizable if it has \\(n\\) linearly independent eigenvectors.\n- **Column Space**: Span of columns of \\(A\\) (all linear combinations of columns).\n  - Example: For \\(A = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 \\\\ 2 & 3 & 4 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}\\), column space is:\n    \\[\n    \\text{span}\\left\\{\\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}, \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ 3 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\\right\\}\n    \\]\n\n### **6. Machine Learning Basics**\n- **Linear Regression**:\n  - Model: \\(f(x) = w^T x + b\\).\n  - **Loss Function (MSE)**:\n    \\[\n    L = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n (f(x_i) - y_i)^2\n    \\]\n  - Example: For \\(f(x) = x_1 + 3x_2 - x_3\\), compute \\(L\\) for given data points.\n- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**:\n  - Goals:\n    1. Maximize variance in projected subspace.\n    2. Minimize reconstruction error.\n  - Steps:\n    1. Center the data.\n    2. Compute covariance matrix.\n    3. Eigen decomposition (eigenvectors = principal components).\n\n### **7. Multivariate Calculus**\n- **Minimizing Sum of Squared Distances**:\n  - For \\(g(p) = \\sum \\|p - x_i\\|^2\\), the minimizer \\(q\\) is the **mean** of \\(\\{x_i\\}\\):\n    \\[\n    q = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i\n    \\]\n  - Example: If \\(q = [3, 0, 3]^T\\), then \\(\\sum x_i = [30, 0, 30]^T\\).\n\n---\n\n## **Mermaid Knowledge Graphs**\n### **Graph 1: Optimization & Convexity**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Linear Programming] --> B[Primal Problem]\n    A --> C[Feasible Region]\n    C --> D[Convex Set]\n    D --> E[Convex Function]\n    E --> F[Hessian Test]\n    E --> G[Quadratic Forms]\n    B --> H[Objective Function]\n    B --> I[Constraints]\n    I --> J[Non-Negativity]\n```\n\n### **Graph 2: Probability & Statistics**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Probability] --> B[Chebyshev's Inequality]\n    A --> C[Normal Distribution]\n    C --> D[Linear Combinations]\n    D --> E[Mean/Variance]\n    C --> F[Standardization]\n    A --> G[Joint Distributions]\n    G --> H[Marginal PDF]\n    G --> I[Conditional PDF]\n```\n\n### **Graph 3: Linear Algebra & ML**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Linear Algebra] --> B[Eigenvalues]\n    A --> C[Diagonalizability]\n    A --> D[Column Space]\n    E[Machine Learning] --> F[Linear Regression]\n    F --> G[Loss Function]\n    E --> H[PCA]\n    H --> I[Variance Maximization]\n    H --> J[Dimensionality Reduction]\n```\n\n### **Graph 4: Geometry & Optimization**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Geometry] --> B[Area Maximization]\n    B --> C[Constraints]\n    C --> D[Calculus]\n    D --> E[Critical Points]\n    A --> F[Distance Minimization]\n    F --> G[Mean as Minimizer]\n```",
