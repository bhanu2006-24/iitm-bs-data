        "summary": "Here\u2019s a structured **summary of core topics, concepts, principles, and equations** for the exam, followed by **Mermaid knowledge graphs** to visualize relationships.\n\n---\n\n## **Core Topics & Concepts Summary**\n### **1. Asymptotic Analysis (Big-O Notation)**\n- **Key Concepts**:\n  - Compare growth rates of functions (e.g., \\(O(n)\\), \\(O(n^2)\\), \\(O(n \\log n)\\)).\n  - Dominant terms determine complexity (e.g., \\(6n^3 \\log n\\) dominates \\(12n^3\\)).\n- **Equations**:\n  - \\(f(n) = O(g(n))\\) if \\(\\exists c, n_0\\) such that \\(f(n) \\leq c \\cdot g(n) \\forall n \\geq n_0\\).\n  - **Example**: \\(6n^3 \\log n + 306n = O(n^3 \\log n)\\) (dominates \\(12n^3 + 102n = O(n^3)\\)).\n- **Exam Focus**:\n  - Identify correct \\(O\\)-relationships between functions (e.g., Q2: \\(g(n) = O(f(n))\\) but not vice versa).\n\n---\n\n### **2. Data Structures**\n#### **A. Linked Lists & Stacks**\n- **Key Concepts**:\n  - **Stack Operations**: `Push`/`Pop` in \\(O(1)\\) time.\n  - **Implementation**:\n    - Use **head** for \\(O(1)\\) `push`/`pop` (Q3: Option A).\n    - Tail operations require traversal (\\(O(n)\\) for `pop` from tail).\n- **Equations**:\n  - Time complexity: \\(O(1)\\) for head operations, \\(O(n)\\) for tail `pop`.\n\n#### **B. Trees**\n- **Binary Search Tree (BST)**:\n  - **Pre-order Traversal**: Root \u2192 Left \u2192 Right.\n  - **Example** (Q6): Given pre-order `[15, 10, 5, 7, 12, 14, 25, 18, 20]`, the right child of root (15) is **25**.\n- **Trie**:\n  - **Maximum Depth**: \\(m + 1\\) (where \\(m\\) = max string length) (Q10).\n- **AVL Tree**:\n  - **Minimum Height**: \\(h \\geq \\log_2(n + 1) - 1\\) (Q21: \\(h = 6\\) for \\(n = 72\\)).\n- **Heap**:\n  - **Max-Heap**: Parent \u2265 children.\n  - **Insertion Order**: Last inserted element cannot be a leaf unless it\u2019s the largest (Q15: 14 and 15 are invalid).\n\n#### **C. Graphs**\n- **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)**:\n  - **Prim\u2019s/Kruskal\u2019s Algorithm**: Greedily select edges to minimize total weight.\n  - **Example** (Q19): MST weight = 8 for the given graph.\n- **Dijkstra\u2019s Algorithm**:\n  - **Visited Order**: Prioritize nodes with the smallest tentative distance.\n  - **Example** (Q5): 5th visited vertex is **C** (order: A \u2192 B \u2192 D \u2192 C \u2192 ...).\n- **Topological Sorting**:\n  - **Course Scheduling**: Resolve dependencies using Kahn\u2019s algorithm or DFS.\n  - **Example** (Q4): Valid order is `(8,10) \u2192 (1,2,11) \u2192 (3) \u2192 (4) \u2192 (9,7) \u2192 (5,6)`.\n- **Maximum Flow**:\n  - **Ford-Fulkerson/Edmonds-Karp**: Augment paths until no more flow is possible.\n  - **Example** (Q26): Max flow = 23.\n\n#### **D. Hash Tables**\n- **Linear Probing**:\n  - **Insertion Order**: Depends on collisions (Q14: Valid orders are A and D).\n- **Collision Resolution**: Open addressing vs. chaining.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Algorithms**\n#### **A. Sorting**\n- **Stable vs. Unstable**:\n  - **Insertion Sort**: Stable, in-place, \\(O(n^2)\\) (Q13: Options C and D).\n  - **Selection Sort**: Unstable, in-place, \\(O(n^2)\\) (always \\(O(n^2)\\) regardless of input order) (Q12: A and B).\n  - **Merge Sort**: Stable, \\(O(n \\log n)\\) (always \\(O(n \\log n)\\)).\n  - **Quick Sort**: Unstable, \\(O(n^2)\\) worst-case (input-dependent).\n- **Inversions**:\n  - Count pairs \\((i, j)\\) where \\(i < j\\) and \\(L[i] > L[j]\\).\n  - **Example** (Q7): `[1,5,4,2,6,3]` has **6** inversions.\n\n#### **B. Dynamic Programming**\n- **Matrix Chain Multiplication**:\n  - **Optimal Parenthesization**: Minimize scalar multiplications.\n  - **Example** (Q9): Optimal order is \\(((M_1 M_2) M_3) M_4\\) (cost = 25,000).\n- **Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)**:\n  - **Recurrence**: \\(LCS[i][j] = 1 + LCS[i-1][j-1]\\) if \\(s1[i] = s2[j]\\), else \\(\\max(LCS[i-1][j], LCS[i][j-1])\\).\n  - **Example** (Q24): LCS length for `pqrqspq` and `qsrpqp` is **4** (`qrqp`).\n\n#### **C. String Matching**\n- **KMP Algorithm**:\n  - **Prefix Function**: Longest prefix-suffix for each substring.\n  - **Example** (Q11): For `onion`, prefix function = `[0, 0, 0, 1, 2]`.\n- **Rabin-Karp**:\n  - **Hashing**: Use modulo arithmetic to detect matches.\n  - **False Positives**: Hash collisions (Q25: 4 false positives for pattern `36`).\n\n#### **D. Greedy Algorithms**\n- **Activity Selection**:\n  - **Minimum Rooms**: Schedule activities to avoid overlaps.\n  - **Example** (Q23): 4 rooms needed.\n- **Minimum Steps to Reach `n`**:\n  - **Operations**: Increment by 1 or double.\n  - **Example** (Q22): 11 steps to reach 1025 (binary representation: \\(2^{10} + 2^0\\)).\n\n#### **E. Recurrence Relations**\n- **Master Theorem**:\n  - Solve recurrences like \\(T(n) = 4T(n/2) + O(n)\\).\n  - **Solution**: \\(O(n^2)\\) (Q8: Option D).\n\n#### **F. NP-Completeness**\n- **Reductions**:\n  - If \\(\\alpha\\) is NP-Complete and \\(\\alpha \\leq_p \\gamma\\), then \\(\\gamma\\) is NP-Hard (Q17: Option C).\n\n---\n\n### **4. Mathematics for CS**\n- **Graph Theory**:\n  - **Minimum Vertices for Connected Graph**: \\(E \\geq V - 1\\) (Q18: \\(V = 9\\) for \\(E = 27\\)).\n  - **Vertex Cover & Independent Set**: \\(|VC| + |IS| = |V|\\) (Q27: \\(|V| = 28\\)).\n- **Combinatorics**:\n  - **Binary Tree Leaves**: \\(L = 2D - 1\\) (where \\(D\\) = nodes with 2 children) (Q20: \\(L = 17\\)).\n\n---\n\n## **Mermaid Knowledge Graphs**\n### **1. Asymptotic Analysis & Complexity**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Asymptotic Analysis] --> B[Big-O Notation]\n    A --> C[Omega Notation]\n    A --> D[Theta Notation]\n    B --> E[\"f(n) = O(g(n))\"]\n    B --> F[\"Compare growth rates\"]\n    E --> G[\"Example: 6n\u00b3logn vs 12n\u00b3\"]\n```\n\n### **2.
