Asymptotic Analysis (Big-O, Theta, Omega)**\n- **Key Concepts**:\n  - Compare growth rates of functions (e.g., \\(O(n^2)\\), \\(O(n \\log n)\\)).\n  - Dominant terms determine complexity (e.g., \\(6n^3 \\log n\\) dominates \\(12n^3\\)).\n- **Equations**:\n  - \\(f(n) = O(g(n))\\) if \\(\\exists c, n_0\\) such that \\(f(n) \\leq c \\cdot g(n) \\forall n \\geq n_0\\).\n  - **Example (Q2)**:\n    \\(g(n) = 12n^3 + 102n\\) vs. \\(f(n) = 6n^3 \\log n + 306n\\).\n    **Answer**: \\(g(n) = O(f(n))\\) but \\(f(n) \\neq O(g(n))\\) (Option C).\n\n---\n\n### **2. Data Structures**\n#### **A. Linked Lists & Stacks**\n- **Key Concepts**:\n  - **Stack Operations**: `Push`/`Pop` in \\(O(1)\\) time requires **head-side operations** (tail-side `Pop` is \\(O(n)\\)).\n  - **Singly Linked List**:\n    ```python\n    class Node:\n        def __init__(self, data):\n            self.data = data\n            self.next = None\n    ```\n  - **Answer (Q3)**: Use **head side** for \\(O(1)\\) `Push`/`Pop` (Option A).\n\n#### **B. Trees**\n- **Binary Search Tree (BST)**:\n  - **Pre-order Traversal**: Root \u2192 Left \u2192 Right.\n  - **Example (Q6)**:\n    Pre-order: `[15, 10, 5, 7, 12, 14, 25, 18, 20]` \u2192 **Right child of root is 25** (Option E).\n- **Trie**:\n  - **Max Depth**: \\(D = m + 1\\) (where \\(m\\) = max string length).\n  - **Answer (Q10)**: \\(D = m + 1\\) (Option D).\n- **AVL Tree**:\n  - **Min Height**: \\(h = \\lceil \\log_\\phi (\\sqrt{5}n + 0.5) - 1 \\rceil\\) (where \\(\\phi = \\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}\\)).\n  - **Answer (Q21)**: For \\(n=72\\), \\(h=6\\) (but given answer is 7; verify calculation).\n- **Heap**:\n  - **Max-Heap**: Parent \u2265 children.\n  - **Example (Q15)**: Last inserted element cannot be a leaf in a heap built incrementally (Options C, E: 14, 15).\n\n#### **C. Graphs**\n- **Topological Sorting**:\n  - **Course Scheduling (Q4)**: Order courses respecting prerequisites.\n  - **Answer**: `(8,10) \u2192 (1,2,11) \u2192 (3) \u2192 (4) \u2192 (9,7) \u2192 (5,6)` (Option C).\n- **Dijkstra\u2019s Algorithm**:\n  - **Priority Queue**: Visits nodes in order of shortest path from source.\n  - **Example (Q5)**: 5th visited node is **C** (Option B).\n- **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)**:\n  - **Prim\u2019s/Kruskal\u2019s**: Greedily select edges to minimize total weight.\n  - **Example (Q19)**: MST weight = **8** (edges: 0-3, 3-4, 4-1, 1-2).\n- **Max Flow**:\n  - **Ford-Fulkerson**: Augment paths until no more flow possible.\n  - **Example (Q26)**: Max flow = **23** (s\u2192a\u2192b\u2192t and s\u2192c\u2192d\u2192t).\n- **Graph Properties**:\n  - **Minimum Vertices (Q18)**: For 27 edges in a connected undirected graph, \\(V = E + 1 = 28\\) (but answer is 8; likely typo in question).\n  - **NP-Completeness (Q17)**:\n    - If \\(\\alpha\\) is NP-Complete and \\(\\alpha \\leq_p \\gamma\\), then \\(\\gamma\\) is **NP-Hard** (Option C).\n\n#### **D. Hashing**\n- **Linear Probing**:\n  - **Example (Q14)**: Insertion order must avoid collisions (Options A, D: `23,36,72,12,54,83`).\n- **Hash Function**: \\(h(k) = k \\mod 10\\).\n\n#### **E. Heap & Priority Queue**\n- **Activity Selection (Q23)**:\n  - **Greedy Algorithm**: Sort by finish time; select compatible activities.\n  - **Min Rooms**: Equal to max overlapping activities (answer = 4).\n\n---\n\n### **3. Algorithms**\n#### **A. Sorting**\n- **Stable/In-Place Sorts**:\n  - **Insertion Sort (Q13)**:\n    - Stable, in-place, \\(O(n^2)\\) worst-case, \\(O(n)\\) best-case.\n    - **Correct Statements**: \"Stable and in-place\" (Option C), \"First \\(m\\) elements sorted after \\(m\\) iterations\" (Option D).\n  - **Time Complexity (Q12)**:\n    - **Selection/Merge Sort**: Always \\(O(n^2)/O(n \\log n)\\) regardless of input order (Options A, B).\n\n#### **B. Divide and Conquer**\n- **Recurrence Relations**:\n  - **Example (Q8)**: \\(T(n) = 4T(n/2) + O(n)\\) \u2192 **\\(O(n^2)\\)** (Master Theorem Case 1).\n- **Matrix Chain Multiplication (Q9)**:\n  - **Optimal Parenthesization**: Minimize scalar multiplications.\n  - **Answer**: \\((M_1(M_2M_3))M_4\\) (Option C, 19000 operations).\n\n#### **C. Dynamic Programming**\n- **Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)**:\n  - **Example (Q24)**: LCS(\"pqrqspq\", \"qsrpqp\") = \"qspq\" (length = 4).\n- **Minimum Steps to Reach \\(n\\) (Q22)**:\n  - **Greedy**: Double when possible; else increment.\n  - **Answer**: For \\(n=1025\\) (binary `10000000001`), steps = **11** (1\u21922\u21924\u2192...\u21921024\u21921025).\n\n#### **D.
