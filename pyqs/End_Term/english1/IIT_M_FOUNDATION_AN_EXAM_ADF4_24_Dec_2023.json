Not only because I\u2019ve never written anything before, but also because it seems to me that later on neither I nor anyone else will be interested in the musings of a thirteen-year-old school girl. Oh well, it doesn\u2019t matter. I feel like writing, and I have an even greater need to get all kinds of things off my chest.  \u2018Paper has more patience than people.\u2019 I thought of this saying on one of those days when I was feeling a little depressed and was sitting at home with my chin in my hands, bored and listless, wondering whether to stay in or go out. I finally stayed where I was, brooding: Yes, paper does have more patience, and since I\u2019m not planning to let anyone else read this stiff-backed notebook grandly referred to as a \u2018diary\u2019, unless I should ever find a real friend, it probably won\u2019t make a bit of difference.  Now I\u2019m back to the point that prompted me to keep a diary in the first place: I don\u2019t have a friend.  Let me put it more clearly, since no one will believe that a thirteen-year-old girl is completely alone in the world. And I\u2019m not. I have loving parents and a sixteen-year-old sister, and there are about thirty people I can call friends. I have a family, loving aunts and a good home. No, on the surface I seem to have everything, except my one true friend. All I think about when I\u2019m with friends is having a good time. I can\u2019t bring myself to talk about anything but ordinary everyday things. We don\u2019t seem to be able to get any closer, and that\u2019s the problem. Maybe it\u2019s my fault that we don\u2019t confide in each other. In any case, that\u2019s just how things are, and unfortunately they\u2019re not liable to change. This is why I\u2019ve started the diary. To enhance the image of this long-awaited friend in my imagination, I don\u2019t want to jot down the facts in this diary the way most people would do, but I want the diary to be my friend, and I\u2019m going to call this friend \u2018Kitty\u2019.  Since no one would understand a word of my stories to Kitty if I were to plunge right in, I\u2019d better provide a brief sketch of my life, much as I dislike doing so.  My father, the most adorable father I\u2019ve ever seen, didn\u2019t marry my mother until he was thirty-six and she was twenty-five. My sister, Margot, was born in Frankfurt in Germany in 1926. I was born on 12 June 1929. I lived in Frankfurt until I was four. My father emigrated to Holland in 1933.   From the Diary of Anne Frank - Anne Frank",

Oh well, it doesn\u2019t matter. I feel like writing, and I have an even greater need to get all kinds of things off my chest.  \u2018Paper has more patience than people.\u2019 I thought of this saying on one of those days when I was feeling a little depressed and was sitting at home with my chin in my hands, bored and listless, wondering whether to stay in or go out. I finally stayed where I was, brooding: Yes, paper does have more patience, and since I\u2019m not planning to let anyone else read this stiff-backed notebook grandly referred to as a \u2018diary\u2019, unless I should ever find a real friend, it probably won\u2019t make a bit of difference.  Now I\u2019m back to the point that prompted me to keep a diary in the first place: I don\u2019t have a friend.  Let me put it more clearly, since no one will believe that a thirteen-year-old girl is completely alone in the world. And I\u2019m not. I have loving parents and a sixteen-year-old sister, and there are about thirty people I can call friends. I have a family, loving aunts and a good home. No, on the surface I seem to have everything, except my one true friend. All I think about when I\u2019m with friends is having a good time. I can\u2019t bring myself to talk about anything but ordinary everyday things. We don\u2019t seem to be able to get any closer, and that\u2019s the problem. Maybe it\u2019s my fault that we don\u2019t confide in each other. In any case, that\u2019s just how things are, and unfortunately they\u2019re not liable to change. This is why I\u2019ve started the diary. To enhance the image of this long-awaited friend in my imagination, I don\u2019t want to jot down the facts in this diary the way most people would do, but I want the diary to be my friend, and I\u2019m going to call this friend \u2018Kitty\u2019.  Since no one would understand a word of my stories to Kitty if I were to plunge right in, I\u2019d better provide a brief sketch of my life, much as I dislike doing so.  My father, the most adorable father I\u2019ve ever seen, didn\u2019t marry my mother until he was thirty-six and she was twenty-five. My sister, Margot, was born in Frankfurt in Germany in 1926. I was born on 12 June 1929. I lived in Frankfurt until I was four. My father emigrated to Holland in 1933.   From the Diary of Anne Frank - Anne Frank",

Not only because I\u2019ve never written anything before, but also because it seems to me that later on neither I nor anyone else will be interested in the musings of a thirteen-year-old school girl. Oh well, it doesn\u2019t matter. I feel like writing, and I have an even greater need to get all kinds of things off my chest.  \u2018Paper has more patience than people.\u2019 I thought of this saying on one of those days when I was feeling a little depressed and was sitting at home with my chin in my hands, bored and listless, wondering whether to stay in or go out. I finally stayed where I was, brooding: Yes, paper does have more patience, and since I\u2019m not planning to let anyone else read this stiff-backed notebook grandly referred to as a \u2018diary\u2019, unless I should ever find a real friend, it probably won\u2019t make a bit of difference.  Now I\u2019m back to the point that prompted me to keep a diary in the first place: I don\u2019t have a friend.  Let me put it more clearly, since no one will believe that a thirteen-year-old girl is completely alone in the world. And I\u2019m not. I have loving parents and a sixteen-year-old sister, and there are about thirty people I can call friends. I have a family, loving aunts and a good home. No, on the surface I seem to have everything, except my one true friend. All I think about when I\u2019m with friends is having a good time. I can\u2019t bring myself to talk about anything but ordinary everyday things. We don\u2019t seem to be able to get any closer, and that\u2019s the problem. Maybe it\u2019s my fault that we don\u2019t confide in each other. In any case, that\u2019s just how things are, and unfortunately they\u2019re not liable to change. This is why I\u2019ve started the diary. To enhance the image of this long-awaited friend in my imagination, I don\u2019t want to jot down the facts in this diary the way most people would do, but I want the diary to be my friend, and I\u2019m going to call this friend \u2018Kitty\u2019.  Since no one would understand a word of my stories to Kitty if I were to plunge right in, I\u2019d better provide a brief sketch of my life, much as I dislike doing so.  My father, the most adorable father I\u2019ve ever seen, didn\u2019t marry my mother until he was thirty-six and she was twenty-five. My sister, Margot, was born in Frankfurt in Germany in 1926. I was born on 12 June 1929. I lived in Frankfurt until I was four. My father emigrated to Holland in 1933.   From the Diary of Anne Frank - Anne Frank",

                            "Read the following passage and answer the given subquestions:  Writing in a diary is a really strange experience for someone like me. Not only because I\u2019ve never written anything before, but also because it seems to me that later on neither I nor anyone else will be interested in the musings of a thirteen-year-old school girl. Oh well, it doesn\u2019t matter. I feel like writing, and I have an even greater need to get all kinds of things off my chest.  \u2018Paper has more patience than people.\u2019 I thought of this saying on one of those days when I was feeling a little depressed and was sitting at home with my chin in my hands, bored and listless, wondering whether to stay in or go out. I finally stayed where I was, brooding: Yes, paper does have more patience, and since I\u2019m not planning to let anyone else read this stiff-backed notebook grandly referred to as a \u2018diary\u2019, unless I should ever find a real friend, it probably won\u2019t make a bit of difference.  Now I\u2019m back to the point that prompted me to keep a diary in the first place: I don\u2019t have a friend.  Let me put it more clearly, since no one will believe that a thirteen-year-old girl is completely alone in the world. And I\u2019m not. I have loving parents and a sixteen-year-old sister, and there are about thirty people I can call friends. I have a family, loving aunts and a good home. No, on the surface I seem to have everything, except my one true friend. All I think about when I\u2019m with friends is having a good time. I can\u2019t bring myself to talk about anything but ordinary everyday things. We don\u2019t seem to be able to get any closer, and that\u2019s the problem. Maybe it\u2019s my fault that we don\u2019t confide in each other. In any case, that\u2019s just how things are, and unfortunately they\u2019re not liable to change. This is why I\u2019ve started the diary. To enhance the image of this long-awaited friend in my imagination, I don\u2019t want to jot down the facts in this diary the way most people would do, but I want the diary to be my friend, and I\u2019m going to call this friend \u2018Kitty\u2019.  Since no one would understand a word of my stories to Kitty if I were to plunge right in, I\u2019d better provide a brief sketch of my life, much as I dislike doing so.  My father, the most adorable father I\u2019ve ever seen, didn\u2019t marry my mother until he was thirty-six and she was twenty-five. My sister, Margot, was born in Frankfurt in Germany in 1926. I was born on 12 June 1929. I lived in Frankfurt until I was four. My father emigrated to Holland in 1933.   From the Diary of Anne Frank - Anne Frank"

Oh well, it doesn\u2019t matter. I feel like writing, and I have an even greater need to get all kinds of things off my chest.  \u2018Paper has more patience than people.\u2019 I thought of this saying on one of those days when I was feeling a little depressed and was sitting at home with my chin in my hands, bored and listless, wondering whether to stay in or go out. I finally stayed where I was, brooding: Yes, paper does have more patience, and since I\u2019m not planning to let anyone else read this stiff-backed notebook grandly referred to as a \u2018diary\u2019, unless I should ever find a real friend, it probably won\u2019t make a bit of difference.  Now I\u2019m back to the point that prompted me to keep a diary in the first place: I don\u2019t have a friend.  Let me put it more clearly, since no one will believe that a thirteen-year-old girl is completely alone in the world. And I\u2019m not. I have loving parents and a sixteen-year-old sister, and there are about thirty people I can call friends. I have a family, loving aunts and a good home. No, on the surface I seem to have everything, except my one true friend. All I think about when I\u2019m with friends is having a good time. I can\u2019t bring myself to talk about anything but ordinary everyday things. We don\u2019t seem to be able to get any closer, and that\u2019s the problem. Maybe it\u2019s my fault that we don\u2019t confide in each other. In any case, that\u2019s just how things are, and unfortunately they\u2019re not liable to change. This is why I\u2019ve started the diary. To enhance the image of this long-awaited friend in my imagination, I don\u2019t want to jot down the facts in this diary the way most people would do, but I want the diary to be my friend, and I\u2019m going to call this friend \u2018Kitty\u2019.  Since no one would understand a word of my stories to Kitty if I were to plunge right in, I\u2019d better provide a brief sketch of my life, much as I dislike doing so.  My father, the most adorable father I\u2019ve ever seen, didn\u2019t marry my mother until he was thirty-six and she was twenty-five. My sister, Margot, was born in Frankfurt in Germany in 1926. I was born on 12 June 1929. I lived in Frankfurt until I was four. My father emigrated to Holland in 1933.   From the Diary of Anne Frank - Anne Frank",

Not only because I\u2019ve never written anything before, but also because it seems to me that later on neither I nor anyone else will be interested in the musings of a thirteen-year-old school girl. Oh well, it doesn\u2019t matter. I feel like writing, and I have an even greater need to get all kinds of things off my chest.  \u2018Paper has more patience than people.\u2019 I thought of this saying on one of those days when I was feeling a little depressed and was sitting at home with my chin in my hands, bored and listless, wondering whether to stay in or go out. I finally stayed where I was, brooding: Yes, paper does have more patience, and since I\u2019m not planning to let anyone else read this stiff-backed notebook grandly referred to as a \u2018diary\u2019, unless I should ever find a real friend, it probably won\u2019t make a bit of difference.  Now I\u2019m back to the point that prompted me to keep a diary in the first place: I don\u2019t have a friend.  Let me put it more clearly, since no one will believe that a thirteen-year-old girl is completely alone in the world. And I\u2019m not. I have loving parents and a sixteen-year-old sister, and there are about thirty people I can call friends. I have a family, loving aunts and a good home. No, on the surface I seem to have everything, except my one true friend. All I think about when I\u2019m with friends is having a good time. I can\u2019t bring myself to talk about anything but ordinary everyday things. We don\u2019t seem to be able to get any closer, and that\u2019s the problem. Maybe it\u2019s my fault that we don\u2019t confide in each other. In any case, that\u2019s just how things are, and unfortunately they\u2019re not liable to change. This is why I\u2019ve started the diary. To enhance the image of this long-awaited friend in my imagination, I don\u2019t want to jot down the facts in this diary the way most people would do, but I want the diary to be my friend, and I\u2019m going to call this friend \u2018Kitty\u2019.  Since no one would understand a word of my stories to Kitty if I were to plunge right in, I\u2019d better provide a brief sketch of my life, much as I dislike doing so.  My father, the most adorable father I\u2019ve ever seen, didn\u2019t marry my mother until he was thirty-six and she was twenty-five. My sister, Margot, was born in Frankfurt in Germany in 1926. I was born on 12 June 1929. I lived in Frankfurt until I was four. My father emigrated to Holland in 1933.   From the Diary of Anne Frank - Anne Frank",

                            "Read the following passage and answer the given subquestions:  Writing in a diary is a really strange experience for someone like me. Not only because I\u2019ve never written anything before, but also because it seems to me that later on neither I nor anyone else will be interested in the musings of a thirteen-year-old school girl. Oh well, it doesn\u2019t matter. I feel like writing, and I have an even greater need to get all kinds of things off my chest.  \u2018Paper has more patience than people.\u2019 I thought of this saying on one of those days when I was feeling a little depressed and was sitting at home with my chin in my hands, bored and listless, wondering whether to stay in or go out. I finally stayed where I was, brooding: Yes, paper does have more patience, and since I\u2019m not planning to let anyone else read this stiff-backed notebook grandly referred to as a \u2018diary\u2019, unless I should ever find a real friend, it probably won\u2019t make a bit of difference.  Now I\u2019m back to the point that prompted me to keep a diary in the first place: I don\u2019t have a friend.  Let me put it more clearly, since no one will believe that a thirteen-year-old girl is completely alone in the world. And I\u2019m not. I have loving parents and a sixteen-year-old sister, and there are about thirty people I can call friends. I have a family, loving aunts and a good home. No, on the surface I seem to have everything, except my one true friend. All I think about when I\u2019m with friends is having a good time. I can\u2019t bring myself to talk about anything but ordinary everyday things. We don\u2019t seem to be able to get any closer, and that\u2019s the problem. Maybe it\u2019s my fault that we don\u2019t confide in each other. In any case, that\u2019s just how things are, and unfortunately they\u2019re not liable to change. This is why I\u2019ve started the diary. To enhance the image of this long-awaited friend in my imagination, I don\u2019t want to jot down the facts in this diary the way most people would do, but I want the diary to be my friend, and I\u2019m going to call this friend \u2018Kitty\u2019.  Since no one would understand a word of my stories to Kitty if I were to plunge right in, I\u2019d better provide a brief sketch of my life, much as I dislike doing so.  My father, the most adorable father I\u2019ve ever seen, didn\u2019t marry my mother until he was thirty-six and she was twenty-five. My sister, Margot, was born in Frankfurt in Germany in 1926. I was born on 12 June 1929. I lived in Frankfurt until I was four. My father emigrated to Holland in 1933.   From the Diary of Anne Frank - Anne Frank"

Not only because I\u2019ve never written anything before, but also because it seems to me that later on neither I nor anyone else will be interested in the musings of a thirteen-year-old school girl. Oh well, it doesn\u2019t matter. I feel like writing, and I have an even greater need to get all kinds of things off my chest.  \u2018Paper has more patience than people.\u2019 I thought of this saying on one of those days when I was feeling a little depressed and was sitting at home with my chin in my hands, bored and listless, wondering whether to stay in or go out. I finally stayed where I was, brooding: Yes, paper does have more patience, and since I\u2019m not planning to let anyone else read this stiff-backed notebook grandly referred to as a \u2018diary\u2019, unless I should ever find a real friend, it probably won\u2019t make a bit of difference.  Now I\u2019m back to the point that prompted me to keep a diary in the first place: I don\u2019t have a friend.  Let me put it more clearly, since no one will believe that a thirteen-year-old girl is completely alone in the world. And I\u2019m not. I have loving parents and a sixteen-year-old sister, and there are about thirty people I can call friends. I have a family, loving aunts and a good home. No, on the surface I seem to have everything, except my one true friend. All I think about when I\u2019m with friends is having a good time. I can\u2019t bring myself to talk about anything but ordinary everyday things. We don\u2019t seem to be able to get any closer, and that\u2019s the problem. Maybe it\u2019s my fault that we don\u2019t confide in each other. In any case, that\u2019s just how things are, and unfortunately they\u2019re not liable to change. This is why I\u2019ve started the diary. To enhance the image of this long-awaited friend in my imagination, I don\u2019t want to jot down the facts in this diary the way most people would do, but I want the diary to be my friend, and I\u2019m going to call this friend \u2018Kitty\u2019.  Since no one would understand a word of my stories to Kitty if I were to plunge right in, I\u2019d better provide a brief sketch of my life, much as I dislike doing so.  My father, the most adorable father I\u2019ve ever seen, didn\u2019t marry my mother until he was thirty-six and she was twenty-five. My sister, Margot, was born in Frankfurt in Germany in 1926. I was born on 12 June 1929. I lived in Frankfurt until I was four. My father emigrated to Holland in 1933.   From the Diary of Anne Frank - Anne Frank",

Not only because I\u2019ve never written anything before, but also because it seems to me that later on neither I nor anyone else will be interested in the musings of a thirteen-year-old school girl. Oh well, it doesn\u2019t matter. I feel like writing, and I have an even greater need to get all kinds of things off my chest.  \u2018Paper has more patience than people.\u2019 I thought of this saying on one of those days when I was feeling a little depressed and was sitting at home with my chin in my hands, bored and listless, wondering whether to stay in or go out. I finally stayed where I was, brooding: Yes, paper does have more patience, and since I\u2019m not planning to let anyone else read this stiff-backed notebook grandly referred to as a \u2018diary\u2019, unless I should ever find a real friend, it probably won\u2019t make a bit of difference.  Now I\u2019m back to the point that prompted me to keep a diary in the first place: I don\u2019t have a friend.  Let me put it more clearly, since no one will believe that a thirteen-year-old girl is completely alone in the world. And I\u2019m not. I have loving parents and a sixteen-year-old sister, and there are about thirty people I can call friends. I have a family, loving aunts and a good home. No, on the surface I seem to have everything, except my one true friend. All I think about when I\u2019m with friends is having a good time. I can\u2019t bring myself to talk about anything but ordinary everyday things. We don\u2019t seem to be able to get any closer, and that\u2019s the problem. Maybe it\u2019s my fault that we don\u2019t confide in each other. In any case, that\u2019s just how things are, and unfortunately they\u2019re not liable to change. This is why I\u2019ve started the diary. To enhance the image of this long-awaited friend in my imagination, I don\u2019t want to jot down the facts in this diary the way most people would do, but I want the diary to be my friend, and I\u2019m going to call this friend \u2018Kitty\u2019.  Since no one would understand a word of my stories to Kitty if I were to plunge right in, I\u2019d better provide a brief sketch of my life, much as I dislike doing so.  My father, the most adorable father I\u2019ve ever seen, didn\u2019t marry my mother until he was thirty-six and she was twenty-five. My sister, Margot, was born in Frankfurt in Germany in 1926. I was born on 12 June 1929. I lived in Frankfurt until I was four. My father emigrated to Holland in 1933.   From the Diary of Anne Frank - Anne Frank",

                            "Read the following passage and answer the given subquestions:  Writing in a diary is a really strange experience for someone like me. Not only because I\u2019ve never written anything before, but also because it seems to me that later on neither I nor anyone else will be interested in the musings of a thirteen-year-old school girl. Oh well, it doesn\u2019t matter. I feel like writing, and I have an even greater need to get all kinds of things off my chest.  \u2018Paper has more patience than people.\u2019 I thought of this saying on one of those days when I was feeling a little depressed and was sitting at home with my chin in my hands, bored and listless, wondering whether to stay in or go out. I finally stayed where I was, brooding: Yes, paper does have more patience, and since I\u2019m not planning to let anyone else read this stiff-backed notebook grandly referred to as a \u2018diary\u2019, unless I should ever find a real friend, it probably won\u2019t make a bit of difference.  Now I\u2019m back to the point that prompted me to keep a diary in the first place: I don\u2019t have a friend.  Let me put it more clearly, since no one will believe that a thirteen-year-old girl is completely alone in the world. And I\u2019m not. I have loving parents and a sixteen-year-old sister, and there are about thirty people I can call friends. I have a family, loving aunts and a good home. No, on the surface I seem to have everything, except my one true friend. All I think about when I\u2019m with friends is having a good time.

                            "Read the following passage and answer the given subquestions:  Writing in a diary is a really strange experience for someone like me. Not only because I\u2019ve never written anything before, but also because it seems to me that later on neither I nor anyone else will be interested in the musings of a thirteen-year-old school girl. Oh well, it doesn\u2019t matter. I feel like writing, and I have an even greater need to get all kinds of things off my chest.  \u2018Paper has more patience than people.\u2019 I thought of this saying on one of those days when I was feeling a little depressed and was sitting at home with my chin in my hands, bored and listless, wondering whether to stay in or go out. I finally stayed where I was, brooding: Yes, paper does have more patience, and since I\u2019m not planning to let anyone else read this stiff-backed notebook grandly referred to as a \u2018diary\u2019, unless I should ever find a real friend, it probably won\u2019t make a bit of difference.  Now I\u2019m back to the point that prompted me to keep a diary in the first place: I don\u2019t have a friend.  Let me put it more clearly, since no one will believe that a thirteen-year-old girl is completely alone in the world. And I\u2019m not. I have loving parents and a sixteen-year-old sister, and there are about thirty people I can call friends. I have a family, loving aunts and a good home. No, on the surface I seem to have everything, except my one true friend. All I think about when I\u2019m with friends is having a good time. I can\u2019t bring myself to talk about anything but ordinary everyday things. We don\u2019t seem to be able to get any closer, and that\u2019s the problem. Maybe it\u2019s my fault that we don\u2019t confide in each other. In any case, that\u2019s just how things are, and unfortunately they\u2019re not liable to change. This is why I\u2019ve started the diary. To enhance the image of this long-awaited friend in my imagination, I don\u2019t want to jot down the facts in this diary the way most people would do, but I want the diary to be my friend, and I\u2019m going to call this friend \u2018Kitty\u2019.  Since no one would understand a word of my stories to Kitty if I were to plunge right in, I\u2019d better provide a brief sketch of my life, much as I dislike doing so.  My father, the most adorable father I\u2019ve ever seen, didn\u2019t marry my mother until he was thirty-six and she was twenty-five. My sister, Margot, was born in Frankfurt in Germany in 1926. I was born on 12 June 1929. I lived in Frankfurt until I was four. My father emigrated to Holland in 1933.   From the Diary of Anne Frank - Anne Frank"

Konark Dance Festival 2022  The enthralling Konark Dance Festival [Edit i] is held every year, from 1st to 5th December [Edit ii] in Open Air Auditorium, Konark, in the backdrop of the mammoth Sun Temple. Launched in 1989, it is co-organised by the Tourism Department and Odissi Research Centre [Edit iii] to provide a platform for classical dancers in India and as well as [Edit iv] to act as showcase for India\u2019s cultural depth where dance forms are concerned. [Edit v] It also comes as a right opportunity for budding artists who are yet to make their presence felt on the international scale.  Conceived as a festival of the classical dances of India, the objective of the Konark Festival was to promote Konark as well as Odisha as a tourist destination. The Konark Dance Festival showcases the best of the traditional and classical dance forms of India besides offering interesting insights into the rich cultural and dance heritage of the country. The Konark Sun Temple is a solitary splendor par excellence built in the 13th century A.D. Folklore and mythology have created layers of legends shrouding the genesis of this world heritage monument.  The leading exponents and dance enthusiasts of almost all the main classical dance forms of India\u2013 including Odissi, Bharatanatyam, Manipuri, Kathakali, Kathak, Kuchipudi and Sattriya\u2013 take part in the five-day classical dance carnival [Edit vi] much adding to the appeal of the event that has few parallels elsewhere.
