Rasping, they fall on his chest, arms and legs. He doesn\u2019t throw them off. Or make an attempt to move away. He lies, staring at the makeshift shop in front of him. \nThe shop: a broken cot with a board nailed to it. Small, fat mangoes heaped in a corner. Bottles of sticky boiled sweets sitting uncertainly on the edge. From a distance, they look filled with colour. Like a palm fan, the old cot-shop woman\u2019s thin hand, laden with bangles, flaps this way and that, trying to keep the flies away.  \nPeanuts heaped in a cone. He stares intently at them. A still mess of tiny worms, glistening in the lamplight. He feels a mad desire. Brush that thin waving hand out of the way. Grab the peanuts and run. But to do this, he must get up. He knows he cannot. His legs have gone to sleep. Heavy, wooden. \nHe looks around him. Dead insects on both sides of his body. What if his body goes stiff forever? He tries to swallow the thick gob of saliva pushing at the walls of his cheeks. It is an effort. In the end, the saliva stays stuck to the roof of his mouth. He tightens his lips into a stitch. \nA massive back cuts his line of vision and hides the cot-shop. He feels relieved, even thankful. He closes his eyes. \nHis stomach, worn thin like a cotton rag, pulls into a spasm. His limbs feel like straw. He must find something to eat. How long can this go on? But then, get up\u2014and do what? Maybe he should stretch out and go to sleep. \nA hoarse, loud voice startles the evening, shattering its twilight calm. A song. From the film showing in the theatre outside which he lies. The hairs on his forearms rise. His body jerks into tremors. It\u2019s a while before it dies down, accepting the blare that hits it. \n(From Current Show by Perumal Murugan, translated by V. Geetha)",

Rasping, they fall on his chest, arms and legs. He doesn\u2019t throw them off. Or make an attempt to move away. He lies, staring at the makeshift shop in front of him. \nThe shop: a broken cot with a board nailed to it. Small, fat mangoes heaped in a corner. Bottles of sticky boiled sweets sitting uncertainly on the edge. From a distance, they look filled with colour. Like a palm fan, the old cot-shop woman\u2019s thin hand, laden with bangles, flaps this way and that, trying to keep the flies away.  \nPeanuts heaped in a cone. He stares intently at them. A still mess of tiny worms, glistening in the lamplight. He feels a mad desire. Brush that thin waving hand out of the way. Grab the peanuts and run. But to do this, he must get up. He knows he cannot. His legs have gone to sleep. Heavy, wooden. \nHe looks around him. Dead insects on both sides of his body. What if his body goes stiff forever? He tries to swallow the thick gob of saliva pushing at the walls of his cheeks. It is an effort. In the end, the saliva stays stuck to the roof of his mouth. He tightens his lips into a stitch. \nA massive back cuts his line of vision and hides the cot-shop. He feels relieved, even thankful. He closes his eyes. \nHis stomach, worn thin like a cotton rag, pulls into a spasm. His limbs feel like straw. He must find something to eat. How long can this go on? But then, get up\u2014and do what? Maybe he should stretch out and go to sleep. \nA hoarse, loud voice startles the evening, shattering its twilight calm. A song. From the film showing in the theatre outside which he lies. The hairs on his forearms rise. His body jerks into tremors. It\u2019s a while before it dies down, accepting the blare that hits it. \n(From Current Show by Perumal Murugan, translated by V. Geetha)",

Rasping, they fall on his chest, arms and legs. He doesn\u2019t throw them off. Or make an attempt to move away. He lies, staring at the makeshift shop in front of him. \nThe shop: a broken cot with a board nailed to it. Small, fat mangoes heaped in a corner. Bottles of sticky boiled sweets sitting uncertainly on the edge. From a distance, they look filled with colour. Like a palm fan, the old cot-shop woman\u2019s thin hand, laden with bangles, flaps this way and that, trying to keep the flies away.  \nPeanuts heaped in a cone. He stares intently at them. A still mess of tiny worms, glistening in the lamplight. He feels a mad desire. Brush that thin waving hand out of the way. Grab the peanuts and run. But to do this, he must get up. He knows he cannot. His legs have gone to sleep. Heavy, wooden. \nHe looks around him. Dead insects on both sides of his body. What if his body goes stiff forever? He tries to swallow the thick gob of saliva pushing at the walls of his cheeks. It is an effort. In the end, the saliva stays stuck to the roof of his mouth. He tightens his lips into a stitch. \nA massive back cuts his line of vision and hides the cot-shop. He feels relieved, even thankful. He closes his eyes. \nHis stomach, worn thin like a cotton rag, pulls into a spasm. His limbs feel like straw. He must find something to eat. How long can this go on? But then, get up\u2014and do what? Maybe he should stretch out and go to sleep. \nA hoarse, loud voice startles the evening, shattering its twilight calm. A song. From the film showing in the theatre outside which he lies. The hairs on his forearms rise. His body jerks into tremors. It\u2019s a while before it dies down, accepting the blare that hits it. \n(From Current Show by Perumal Murugan, translated by V. Geetha)"

Rasping, they fall on his chest, arms and legs. He doesn\u2019t throw them off. Or make an attempt to move away. He lies, staring at the makeshift shop in front of him. \nThe shop: a broken cot with a board nailed to it. Small, fat mangoes heaped in a corner. Bottles of sticky boiled sweets sitting uncertainly on the edge. From a distance, they look filled with colour. Like a palm fan, the old cot-shop woman\u2019s thin hand, laden with bangles, flaps this way and that, trying to keep the flies away.  \nPeanuts heaped in a cone. He stares intently at them. A still mess of tiny worms, glistening in the lamplight. He feels a mad desire. Brush that thin waving hand out of the way. Grab the peanuts and run. But to do this, he must get up. He knows he cannot. His legs have gone to sleep. Heavy, wooden. \nHe looks around him. Dead insects on both sides of his body. What if his body goes stiff forever? He tries to swallow the thick gob of saliva pushing at the walls of his cheeks. It is an effort. In the end, the saliva stays stuck to the roof of his mouth. He tightens his lips into a stitch. \nA massive back cuts his line of vision and hides the cot-shop. He feels relieved, even thankful. He closes his eyes. \nHis stomach, worn thin like a cotton rag, pulls into a spasm. His limbs feel like straw. He must find something to eat. How long can this go on? But then, get up\u2014and do what? Maybe he should stretch out and go to sleep. \nA hoarse, loud voice startles the evening, shattering its twilight calm. A song. From the film showing in the theatre outside which he lies. The hairs on his forearms rise. His body jerks into tremors. It\u2019s a while before it dies down, accepting the blare that hits it. \n(From Current Show by Perumal Murugan, translated by V. Geetha)",

He lies, staring at the makeshift shop in front of him. \nThe shop: a broken cot with a board nailed to it. Small, fat mangoes heaped in a corner. Bottles of sticky boiled sweets sitting uncertainly on the edge. From a distance, they look filled with colour. Like a palm fan, the old cot-shop woman\u2019s thin hand, laden with bangles, flaps this way and that, trying to keep the flies away.  \nPeanuts heaped in a cone. He stares intently at them. A still mess of tiny worms, glistening in the lamplight. He feels a mad desire. Brush that thin waving hand out of the way. Grab the peanuts and run. But to do this, he must get up. He knows he cannot. His legs have gone to sleep. Heavy, wooden. \nHe looks around him. Dead insects on both sides of his body. What if his body goes stiff forever? He tries to swallow the thick gob of saliva pushing at the walls of his cheeks. It is an effort. In the end, the saliva stays stuck to the roof of his mouth. He tightens his lips into a stitch. \nA massive back cuts his line of vision and hides the cot-shop. He feels relieved, even thankful. He closes his eyes. \nHis stomach, worn thin like a cotton rag, pulls into a spasm. His limbs feel like straw. He must find something to eat. How long can this go on? But then, get up\u2014and do what? Maybe he should stretch out and go to sleep. \nA hoarse, loud voice startles the evening, shattering its twilight calm. A song. From the film showing in the theatre outside which he lies. The hairs on his forearms rise. His body jerks into tremors. It\u2019s a while before it dies down, accepting the blare that hits it. \n(From Current Show by Perumal Murugan, translated by V. Geetha)",

Rasping, they fall on his chest, arms and legs. He doesn\u2019t throw them off. Or make an attempt to move away. He lies, staring at the makeshift shop in front of him. \nThe shop: a broken cot with a board nailed to it. Small, fat mangoes heaped in a corner. Bottles of sticky boiled sweets sitting uncertainly on the edge. From a distance, they look filled with colour. Like a palm fan, the old cot-shop woman\u2019s thin hand, laden with bangles, flaps this way and that, trying to keep the flies away.  \nPeanuts heaped in a cone. He stares intently at them. A still mess of tiny worms, glistening in the lamplight. He feels a mad desire. Brush that thin waving hand out of the way. Grab the peanuts and run. But to do this, he must get up. He knows he cannot. His legs have gone to sleep. Heavy, wooden. \nHe looks around him. Dead insects on both sides of his body. What if his body goes stiff forever? He tries to swallow the thick gob of saliva pushing at the walls of his cheeks. It is an effort. In the end, the saliva stays stuck to the roof of his mouth. He tightens his lips into a stitch. \nA massive back cuts his line of vision and hides the cot-shop. He feels relieved, even thankful. He closes his eyes. \nHis stomach, worn thin like a cotton rag, pulls into a spasm. His limbs feel like straw. He must find something to eat. How long can this go on? But then, get up\u2014and do what? Maybe he should stretch out and go to sleep. \nA hoarse, loud voice startles the evening, shattering its twilight calm. A song. From the film showing in the theatre outside which he lies. The hairs on his forearms rise. His body jerks into tremors. It\u2019s a while before it dies down, accepting the blare that hits it. \n(From Current Show by Perumal Murugan, translated by V. Geetha)",

Rasping, they fall on his chest, arms and legs. He doesn\u2019t throw them off. Or make an attempt to move away. He lies, staring at the makeshift shop in front of him. \nThe shop: a broken cot with a board nailed to it. Small, fat mangoes heaped in a corner. Bottles of sticky boiled sweets sitting uncertainly on the edge. From a distance, they look filled with colour. Like a palm fan, the old cot-shop woman\u2019s thin hand, laden with bangles, flaps this way and that, trying to keep the flies away.  \nPeanuts heaped in a cone. He stares intently at them. A still mess of tiny worms, glistening in the lamplight. He feels a mad desire. Brush that thin waving hand out of the way. Grab the peanuts and run. But to do this, he must get up. He knows he cannot. His legs have gone to sleep. Heavy, wooden. \nHe looks around him. Dead insects on both sides of his body. What if his body goes stiff forever? He tries to swallow the thick gob of saliva pushing at the walls of his cheeks. It is an effort. In the end, the saliva stays stuck to the roof of his mouth. He tightens his lips into a stitch. \nA massive back cuts his line of vision and hides the cot-shop. He feels relieved, even thankful.

                            "Read the following passage and answer the given subquestions:\n\nThe young man slumps against a lamp post. \nA buzzing aura of insects around his face. \nSome spiral down to their deaths, scorched by the heat of the lamp. Rasping, they fall on his chest, arms and legs. He doesn\u2019t throw them off. Or make an attempt to move away. He lies, staring at the makeshift shop in front of him. \nThe shop: a broken cot with a board nailed to it. Small, fat mangoes heaped in a corner. Bottles of sticky boiled sweets sitting uncertainly on the edge. From a distance, they look filled with colour. Like a palm fan, the old cot-shop woman\u2019s thin hand, laden with bangles, flaps this way and that, trying to keep the flies away.  \nPeanuts heaped in a cone. He stares intently at them. A still mess of tiny worms, glistening in the lamplight. He feels a mad desire. Brush that thin waving hand out of the way. Grab the peanuts and run. But to do this, he must get up. He knows he cannot. His legs have gone to sleep. Heavy, wooden. \nHe looks around him. Dead insects on both sides of his body. What if his body goes stiff forever? He tries to swallow the thick gob of saliva pushing at the walls of his cheeks. It is an effort. In the end, the saliva stays stuck to the roof of his mouth. He tightens his lips into a stitch. \nA massive back cuts his line of vision and hides the cot-shop. He feels relieved, even thankful. He closes his eyes. \nHis stomach, worn thin like a cotton rag, pulls into a spasm. His limbs feel like straw. He must find something to eat. How long can this go on? But then, get up\u2014and do what? Maybe he should stretch out and go to sleep. \nA hoarse, loud voice startles the evening, shattering its twilight calm. A song. From the film showing in the theatre outside which he lies. The hairs on his forearms rise. His body jerks into tremors. It\u2019s a while before it dies down, accepting the blare that hits it. \n(From Current Show by Perumal Murugan, translated by V. Geetha)"

Rasping, they fall on his chest, arms and legs. He doesn\u2019t throw them off. Or make an attempt to move away. He lies, staring at the makeshift shop in front of him. \nThe shop: a broken cot with a board nailed to it. Small, fat mangoes heaped in a corner. Bottles of sticky boiled sweets sitting uncertainly on the edge. From a distance, they look filled with colour. Like a palm fan, the old cot-shop woman\u2019s thin hand, laden with bangles, flaps this way and that, trying to keep the flies away.  \nPeanuts heaped in a cone. He stares intently at them. A still mess of tiny worms, glistening in the lamplight. He feels a mad desire. Brush that thin waving hand out of the way. Grab the peanuts and run. But to do this, he must get up. He knows he cannot. His legs have gone to sleep. Heavy, wooden. \nHe looks around him. Dead insects on both sides of his body. What if his body goes stiff forever? He tries to swallow the thick gob of saliva pushing at the walls of his cheeks. It is an effort. In the end, the saliva stays stuck to the roof of his mouth. He tightens his lips into a stitch. \nA massive back cuts his line of vision and hides the cot-shop. He feels relieved, even thankful. He closes his eyes. \nHis stomach, worn thin like a cotton rag, pulls into a spasm. His limbs feel like straw. He must find something to eat. How long can this go on? But then, get up\u2014and do what? Maybe he should stretch out and go to sleep. \nA hoarse, loud voice startles the evening, shattering its twilight calm. A song. From the film showing in the theatre outside which he lies. The hairs on his forearms rise. His body jerks into tremors. It\u2019s a while before it dies down, accepting the blare that hits it. \n(From Current Show by Perumal Murugan, translated by V. Geetha)",

Rasping, they fall on his chest, arms and legs. He doesn\u2019t throw them off. Or make an attempt to move away. He lies, staring at the makeshift shop in front of him. \nThe shop: a broken cot with a board nailed to it. Small, fat mangoes heaped in a corner. Bottles of sticky boiled sweets sitting uncertainly on the edge. From a distance, they look filled with colour. Like a palm fan, the old cot-shop woman\u2019s thin hand, laden with bangles, flaps this way and that, trying to keep the flies away.  \nPeanuts heaped in a cone. He stares intently at them. A still mess of tiny worms, glistening in the lamplight. He feels a mad desire. Brush that thin waving hand out of the way. Grab the peanuts and run. But to do this, he must get up. He knows he cannot. His legs have gone to sleep. Heavy, wooden. \nHe looks around him. Dead insects on both sides of his body. What if his body goes stiff forever? He tries to swallow the thick gob of saliva pushing at the walls of his cheeks. It is an effort. In the end, the saliva stays stuck to the roof of his mouth. He tightens his lips into a stitch. \nA massive back cuts his line of vision and hides the cot-shop. He feels relieved, even thankful. He closes his eyes. \nHis stomach, worn thin like a cotton rag, pulls into a spasm. His limbs feel like straw. He must find something to eat. How long can this go on? But then, get up\u2014and do what? Maybe he should stretch out and go to sleep. \nA hoarse, loud voice startles the evening, shattering its twilight calm. A song. From the film showing in the theatre outside which he lies. The hairs on his forearms rise. His body jerks into tremors. It\u2019s a while before it dies down, accepting the blare that hits it. \n(From Current Show by Perumal Murugan, translated by V. Geetha)",

He lies, staring at the makeshift shop in front of him. \nThe shop: a broken cot with a board nailed to it. Small, fat mangoes heaped in a corner. Bottles of sticky boiled sweets sitting uncertainly on the edge. From a distance, they look filled with colour. Like a palm fan, the old cot-shop woman\u2019s thin hand, laden with bangles, flaps this way and that, trying to keep the flies away.  \nPeanuts heaped in a cone. He stares intently at them. A still mess of tiny worms, glistening in the lamplight. He feels a mad desire. Brush that thin waving hand out of the way. Grab the peanuts and run. But to do this, he must get up. He knows he cannot. His legs have gone to sleep. Heavy, wooden. \nHe looks around him. Dead insects on both sides of his body. What if his body goes stiff forever? He tries to swallow the thick gob of saliva pushing at the walls of his cheeks. It is an effort. In the end, the saliva stays stuck to the roof of his mouth. He tightens his lips into a stitch. \nA massive back cuts his line of vision and hides the cot-shop. He feels relieved, even thankful. He closes his eyes. \nHis stomach, worn thin like a cotton rag, pulls into a spasm. His limbs feel like straw. He must find something to eat. How long can this go on? But then, get up\u2014and do what? Maybe he should stretch out and go to sleep. \nA hoarse, loud voice startles the evening, shattering its twilight calm. A song. From the film showing in the theatre outside which he lies. The hairs on his forearms rise. His body jerks into tremors. It\u2019s a while before it dies down, accepting the blare that hits it. \n(From Current Show by Perumal Murugan, translated by V. Geetha)",

At archaeological sites across the Amazon River basin, mysterious patches of unusually fertile soil dot the landscape.

But a slew of archeological finds in recent decades \u2014 including the discovery of ancient urban centers in Amazonian areas of modern-day Bolivia \u2014 has revealed that people were actively shaping the Amazon for thousands of years before the arrival of the Europeans. Perron and his colleagues reviewed interviews of the Kuikuro people conducted by a Kuikuro filmmaker in 2018.

At archaeological sites across the Amazon River basin, mysterious patches of unusually fertile soil dot the landscape. Scientists have long debated the origin of this \u201cdark earth,\u201d which is darker in color than surrounding soils and richer in carbon.

But a slew of archeological finds in recent decades \u2014 including the discovery of ancient urban centers in Amazonian areas of modern-day Bolivia \u2014 has revealed that people were actively shaping the Amazon for thousands of years before the arrival of the Europeans. Perron and his colleagues reviewed interviews of the Kuikuro people conducted by a Kuikuro filmmaker in 2018.

At archaeological sites across the Amazon River basin, mysterious patches of unusually fertile soil dot the landscape. Scientists have long debated the origin of this \u201cdark earth,\u201d which is darker in color than surrounding soils and richer in carbon. Now, researchers have shown that the indigenous Kuikuro people in southeastern Brazil intentionally create similar soil around their villages. [Edit i] <b>The finding, presented December 16 at the American Geophysical Union </b><b>meeting, adds evidence to the idea that the Amazonians deliberately manufactured such </b><b>soil long-ago.</b> [Edit ii] <b>In doing so, these early inhabitants may have inadvertently stored </b><b>massive quantities of carbon in the soil, says study presenter Taylor Perron, an earth </b><b>scientist at MIT.</b> [Edit iii] <b>The technique, he says, could provide a blueprint for developing </b><b>methods of sustainably locking atmospheric carbon in tropical soils, helping fight climate </b><b>change.</b>\n\nThe Western world has long viewed the Amazon as a vast wilderness that was relatively untouched before the Europeans showed up. At the center of this argument is the idea that the Amazon\u2019s soil, which is poor in nutrients, precluded its inhabitants from developing agriculture at a scale required to support complex societies. But a slew of archeological finds in recent decades \u2014 including the discovery of ancient urban centers in Amazonian areas of modern-day Bolivia \u2014 has revealed that people were actively shaping the Amazon for thousands of years before the arrival of the Europeans.
