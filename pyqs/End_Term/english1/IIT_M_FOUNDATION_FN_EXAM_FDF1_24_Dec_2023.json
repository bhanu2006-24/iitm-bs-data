We felt angry; the proper first stage, he said, is denial. In late August this year, my 38-year-old son, Michael, died suddenly in his sleep, leaving behind a 2-year-old son and a wife expecting their next child. There is no set form for grief, and no \u2018right\u2019 way to express it. There seems to be an expectation that, after a great loss, we will progress systematically through the well-known stages of grief. It is wrong, we are told, to jump to anger \u2014 or to wallow too long in this stage before moving towards acceptance. But I was, and am, angry. To make parents bury their children is wrong; to have both my wife and son taken from me, for forever and a day, is cruel beyond words. A relative from Jerusalem, who is a psychiatrist, brought some solace by citing the maxim: \u2018We are not to ask why, but what.\u2019 The \u2018what\u2019 is that which survivors in grief are bound to do for one another. Following that advice, my family, close friends and I keep busy, calling each other and giving long answers to simple questions like, \u201cHow did your day go today?\u201d We try to avoid thinking about either the immediate past or the bereft future. We take turns playing with Max, Michael\u2019s two-year-old son. Friends spend nights with the young widow, and will be among those holding her hand when the baby is born.

We felt angry; the proper first stage, he said, is denial. In late August this year, my 38-year-old son, Michael, died suddenly in his sleep, leaving behind a 2-year-old son and a wife expecting their next child. There is no set form for grief, and no \u2018right\u2019 way to express it. There seems to be an expectation that, after a great loss, we will progress systematically through the well-known stages of grief. It is wrong, we are told, to jump to anger \u2014 or to wallow too long in this stage before moving towards acceptance. But I was, and am, angry. To make parents bury their children is wrong; to have both my wife and son taken from me, for forever and a day, is cruel beyond words. A relative from Jerusalem, who is a psychiatrist, brought some solace by citing the maxim: \u2018We are not to ask why, but what.\u2019 The \u2018what\u2019 is that which survivors in grief are bound to do for one another. Following that advice, my family, close friends and I keep busy, calling each other and giving long answers to simple questions like, \u201cHow did your day go today?\u201d We try to avoid thinking about either the immediate past or the bereft future. We take turns playing with Max, Michael\u2019s two-year-old son. Friends spend nights with the young widow, and will be among those holding her hand when the baby is born.

In late August this year, my 38-year-old son, Michael, died suddenly in his sleep, leaving behind a 2-year-old son and a wife expecting their next child. There is no set form for grief, and no \u2018right\u2019 way to express it. There seems to be an expectation that, after a great loss, we will progress systematically through the well-known stages of grief. It is wrong, we are told, to jump to anger \u2014 or to wallow too long in this stage before moving towards acceptance. But I was, and am, angry. To make parents bury their children is wrong; to have both my wife and son taken from me, for forever and a day, is cruel beyond words. A relative from Jerusalem, who is a psychiatrist, brought some solace by citing the maxim: \u2018We are not to ask why, but what.\u2019 The \u2018what\u2019 is that which survivors in grief are bound to do for one another. Following that advice, my family, close friends and I keep busy, calling each other and giving long answers to simple questions like, \u201cHow did your day go today?\u201d We try to avoid thinking about either the immediate past or the bereft future. We take turns playing with Max, Michael\u2019s two-year-old son. Friends spend nights with the young widow, and will be among those holding her hand when the baby is born.

We felt angry; the proper first stage, he said, is denial. In late August this year, my 38-year-old son, Michael, died suddenly in his sleep, leaving behind a 2-year-old son and a wife expecting their next child. There is no set form for grief, and no \u2018right\u2019 way to express it. There seems to be an expectation that, after a great loss, we will progress systematically through the well-known stages of grief. It is wrong, we are told, to jump to anger \u2014 or to wallow too long in this stage before moving towards acceptance. But I was, and am, angry. To make parents bury their children is wrong; to have both my wife and son taken from me, for forever and a day, is cruel beyond words. A relative from Jerusalem, who is a psychiatrist, brought some solace by citing the maxim: \u2018We are not to ask why, but what.\u2019 The \u2018what\u2019 is that which survivors in grief are bound to do for one another. Following that advice, my family, close friends and I keep busy, calling each other and giving long answers to simple questions like, \u201cHow did your day go today?\u201d We try to avoid thinking about either the immediate past or the bereft future. We take turns playing with Max, Michael\u2019s two-year-old son. Friends spend nights with the young widow, and will be among those holding her hand when the baby is born.

We felt angry; the proper first stage, he said, is denial. In late August this year, my 38-year-old son, Michael, died suddenly in his sleep, leaving behind a 2-year-old son and a wife expecting their next child. There is no set form for grief, and no \u2018right\u2019 way to express it. There seems to be an expectation that, after a great loss, we will progress systematically through the well-known stages of grief. It is wrong, we are told, to jump to anger \u2014 or to wallow too long in this stage before moving towards acceptance. But I was, and am, angry. To make parents bury their children is wrong; to have both my wife and son taken from me, for forever and a day, is cruel beyond words. A relative from Jerusalem, who is a psychiatrist, brought some solace by citing the maxim: \u2018We are not to ask why, but what.\u2019 The \u2018what\u2019 is that which survivors in grief are bound to do for one another. Following that advice, my family, close friends and I keep busy, calling each other and giving long answers to simple questions like, \u201cHow did your day go today?\u201d We try to avoid thinking about either the immediate past or the bereft future. We take turns playing with Max, Michael\u2019s two-year-old son. Friends spend nights with the young widow, and will be among those holding her hand when the baby is born.

We felt angry; the proper first stage, he said, is denial. In late August this year, my 38-year-old son, Michael, died suddenly in his sleep, leaving behind a 2-year-old son and a wife expecting their next child. There is no set form for grief, and no \u2018right\u2019 way to express it. There seems to be an expectation that, after a great loss, we will progress systematically through the well-known stages of grief. It is wrong, we are told, to jump to anger \u2014 or to wallow too long in this stage before moving towards acceptance. But I was, and am, angry. To make parents bury their children is wrong; to have both my wife and son taken from me, for forever and a day, is cruel beyond words. A relative from Jerusalem, who is a psychiatrist, brought some solace by citing the maxim: \u2018We are not to ask why, but what.\u2019 The \u2018what\u2019 is that which survivors in grief are bound to do for one another. Following that advice, my family, close friends and I keep busy, calling each other and giving long answers to simple questions like, \u201cHow did your day go today?\u201d We try to avoid thinking about either the immediate past or the bereft future. We take turns playing with Max, Michael\u2019s two-year-old son. Friends spend nights with the young widow, and will be among those holding her hand when the baby is born.

What if you lived in an apartment that did not have its own kitchen or bathroom?  A New York think tank called the 5Boro Institute says such apartments could put a dent in two crises the city is facing \u2014 the chronic shortage of housing and the surplus of office space in Manhattan. 5Boro maintains that empty office space could be turned into housing for \u201cflexible co-living,\u201d with communal kitchens and bathrooms.  5Boro argues in a new report that such conversions would cost less and could be completed faster than conventional office-to-residential conversions. 5Boro says there is just over 100 million square feet of available office space in Manhattan. That figure could grow as long-term leases go unrenewed \u2014 or as commercial tenants take less space, because remote work means fewer employees are going into the office. 5Boro\u2019s report says that flexible co-living, a twist on co-living, or \u201cdorms for adults,\u201d could turn the empty space into apartments and surmount the architectural and regulatory problems that often stymie office-to-residential [Edit i] project. The group is calling for the city to set up a pilot conversion.  \u201cGiven the state of the housing crisis and the fact that New York is tied for first place in a global ranking of the most expensive cities in the world, we need to be trying new ideas,\u201d said Grace Rauh, the executive director of 5Boro and an author of a new report about [Edit ii] office-to-resident conversions. \u201c[Edit iii] We think not only is this doable, but we think this is a way to maximize the amount of housing that can be created through office-to-residential conversions and to minimize the costs, so rents for tenants can be much more affordable.\u201d  Adapted from: Barron, James. \u201cWill New Yorkers Move Into Homes With Shared Kitchens and Baths?.\u201d New York Today, 05 Oct, 2023, The New York Times,",

        "summary": "Here\u2019s a structured **summary of core topics, concepts, and principles** for the **\"English I (Computer-Based Exam)\"** paper, along with **Mermaid knowledge graphs** to visualize relationships between key themes.\n\n---\n\n### **Core Topics & Concepts**\nThe exam covers **5 major areas**:\n1. **Reading Comprehension**\n2. **Grammar & Vocabulary**\n3. **Writing & Communication Skills**\n4. **Literary Devices & Figures of Speech**\n5. **Pronunciation & Syllabification**\n\n---\n\n## **1. Reading Comprehension**\n### **Key Concepts**\n- **Understanding Passages**:\n  - Identify **main ideas**, **supporting details**, **tone** (formal/informal), and **author\u2019s purpose**.\n  - Example: The passage on **grief (Amitai Etzioni)** tests emotional context, vocabulary (e.g., *solace*, *maxim*), and inference.\n  - The **New York co-living article** tests **persuasive techniques**, **data interpretation**, and **editorial suggestions**.\n\n- **Inference & Analysis**:\n  - Draw conclusions from implicit information (e.g., *\"Why does the narrator focus on \u2018what\u2019 instead of \u2018why\u2019?\"*).\n  - Recognize **cause-effect relationships** (e.g., *\"remote work \u2192 surplus office space\"*).\n\n- **Vocabulary in Context**:\n  - Define words like *bereft*, *wallow*, *consolation*, *maxim* based on usage.\n  - **Antonyms/Synonyms**: Match words to opposites (e.g., *attend \u2194 desert*, *clean \u2194 contaminate*).\n\n### **Key Questions to Practice**\n- What is the **central theme** of the passage?\n- How does the author **support their argument**? (e.g., statistics, quotes, examples)\n- What **emotion or tone** does the passage convey?\n\n---\n\n## **2. Grammar & Vocabulary**\n### **A. Tenses & Verb Forms**\n- **Past Tense Consistency**:\n  - Example: *\"The countryman **was sowing** hemp seeds while birds **were hopping**.\"*\n  - **Key Rule**: Use past continuous for **ongoing actions** in the past.\n\n- **Conditional Sentences**:\n  - *\"If you **don\u2019t pick** the seeds, you **will repent** it.\"* (First conditional: *if + present \u2192 will + base verb*).\n\n- **Modal Verbs**:\n  - *\"**May** I come in?\"* (permission)\n  - *\"I **would** have gone if...\"* (hypothetical past).\n\n### **B. Articles & Prepositions**\n- **Articles (a/an/the)**:\n  - *\"A noise\"* (unspecific), *\"the familiar sound\"* (specific).\n- **Prepositions**:\n  - *\"At the restaurant\"* (specific location), *\"on the table\"* (surface).\n\n### **C. Syntax & Sentence Structure**\n- **Subject-Verb Agreement**:\n  - *\"It is **I** who **am** the culprit.\"* (not *\"is\"*).\n- **Subjunctive Mood**:\n  - *\"I wish I **were** a child.\"* (hypothetical).\n\n### **D. Common Errors**\n| Incorrect | Correct | Rule |\n|-----------|---------|------|\n| *\"Behaves friendly\"* | *\"Behaves **in a friendly manner**\"* | Adverbs modify verbs; adjectives need a linker. |\n| *\"I was playing\"* (habitual past) | *\"I **played**\"* | Simple past for repeated actions. |\n| *\"Most amazing site I saw\"* | *\"The most amazing site...\"* | Superlatives need *\"the\"*. |\n\n---\n\n## **3. Writing & Communication Skills**\n### **A. Dialogue Completion**\n- **Telephonic Conversations**:\n  - **Greetings**: *\"Hello, may I know who\u2019s speaking?\"*\n  - **Polite Requests**: *\"Could you bring your sister?\"*\n  - **Closings**: *\"Looking forward to meeting you. Bye!\"*\n\n### **B. Formal vs. Informal Tone**\n| **Formal** (New York Times article) | **Informal** (Casual chat) |\n|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| *\"5Boro argues in a report...\"* | *\"Hey, what if we shared kitchens?\"* |\n| *\"Surmount regulatory problems\"* | *\"Fix the rules\"* |\n\n### **C. Editing & Proofreading**\n- **Common Edits**:\n  - *\"Office-to-resident\"* \u2192 *\"office-to-**residential**\"* (adjective form).\n  - *\"Project\"* \u2192 *\"projects\"* (plural for generality).\n  - *\"We think not only is this doable...\"* \u2192 *\"We not only think this is doable...\"* (parallel structure).\n\n---\n\n## **4. Literary Devices & Figures of Speech**\n| Device | Example from Passages | Effect |\n|--------|-----------------------|--------|\n| **Metaphor** | *\"Dorms for adults\"* (co-living spaces) | Compares without \"like/as\". |\n| **Maxim** | *\"We are not to ask why, but what.\"* | Concise life lesson. |\n| **Repetition** | *\"We think... we think...\"* | Emphasizes urgency. |\n| **Irony** | *\"Grieving \u2018wrong\u2019\"* | Expectation vs. reality. |\n\n---\n\n## **5. Pronunciation & Syllabification**\n### **A. Syllables**\n- **Rules**:\n  - *\"Straight\"* = 1 syllable (*strait*).\n  - *\"Dissimilarity\"* = 6 syllables (*dis-si-mil-ar-i-ty*).\n- **Plural Markers**:\n  - *\"Lemons\"* = **[z]** sound (voiced).\n  - *\"Cats\"* = **[s]** sound (voiceless).\n\n### **B. Stress Patterns**\n- *\"Popularity\"* = **pop-u-LAR-i-ty** (stress on 3rd syllable).\n\n### **C. Phonetic Similarities**\n- **Odd One Out**: *\"These\"* (others: *thief*, *thought*, *think* all have `/\u03b8/`).\n\n---\n\n## **Mermaid Knowledge Graphs**\n### **Graph 1: Reading Comprehension Topics**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Reading Comprehension] --> B[Passage Analysis]\n    A --> C[Vocabulary in Context]\n    A --> D[Tone & Purpose]\n    B --> E[Main Idea]\n    B --> F[Supporting Details]\n    C --> G[Antonyms/Synonyms]\n    C --> H[Word Meanings]\n    D --> I[Formal vs. Informal]\n    D --> J[Author's Argument]\n```\n\n### **Graph 2: Grammar & Writing Skills**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Grammar] --> B[Tenses]\n    A --> C[Articles/Prepositions]\n    A --> D[Sentence Structure]\n    B --> E[Past Continuous]\n    B --> F[Conditionals]\n    D --> G[Subject-Verb Agreement]\n    D --> H[Subjunctive Mood]\n    A --> I[Writing Skills]\n    I --> J[Dialogue Completion]\n    I --> K[Formal vs. Informal]\n    I --> L[Editing]\n```\n\n### **Graph 3: Pronunciation & Literary Devices**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Pronunciation] --> B[Syllables]\n    A --> C[Plural Markers]\n    A --> D[Stress Patterns]\n    B --> E[Monosyllabic Words]\n    B --> F[Polysyllabic Words]\n    C --> G[Voiced vs. Voiceless]\n    D --> H[Word Stress Rules]\n    A --> I[Literary Devices]\n    I --> J[Metaphor/Maxim]\n    I --> K[Repetition]\n    I --> L[Irony]\n```\n\n---\n\n## **Key Equations (For Grammar Rules)**\n1. **First Conditional**:\n   `If + [present simple], [will + base verb]`\n   Example: *If you **call** me, I **will** come.*\n\n2. **Past Continuous**:\n   `[was/were + verb-ing]`\n   Example: *She **was hopping** when I saw her.*\n\n3. **Superlative Adjectives**:\n   `the + [adjective]-est` or `the most + [adjective]`\n   Example: *the **most amazing** site.*\n\n4. **Subject-Verb Agreement (Singular/Plural)**:\n   `I/You/We/They + [base verb]` vs. `He/She/It + [verb-s]`\n   Example: *She **wishes** (not \"wish\").*\n\n5. **Subjunctive Mood**:\n   `I wish + [past simple]` (for hypotheticals)\n   Example: *I wish I **were** rich.*\n\n---\n\n## **Exam Strategy**\n1. **Reading Comprehension**:\n   - Skim for **main idea**, then read questions carefully.\n   - For vocabulary, **eliminate wrong options** first.\n\n2. **Grammar**:\n   - Check **tense consistency** and **subject-verb agreement**.\n   - For dialogues, **match tone** (formal/informal).\n\n3. **Editing**:\n   - Look for **plural/singular errors**, **adjective/adverb mix-ups**, and **parallel structure**.\n\n4. **Pronunciation**:\n   - **Count syllables** aloud.\n   - Remember: `-s` endings can sound like **[s]**, **[z]**, or **[iz]**.\n\n---\n**Final Tip**: Focus on **common error patterns** (e.g., *\"I wish I were\"*) and **vocabulary in context**.
