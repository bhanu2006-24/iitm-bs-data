The narratives through which liberal arts courses are shunned are all too familiar. Social sciences never had democratic equality with the natural/biological sciences and technological education.

Humanities can flourish when democratic values thrive in society, the spirit of questioning is highly regarded, and liberalism enjoys legitimacy. In other words, if philosophy matters to our lives, humanities is indispensable. \nBut most researchers and students of humanities do not think that any autocratic state would be fundamentally interested in reviving humanities and social sciences since these disciplines encourage critical thinking and questioning of authority structures.

Even the content in liberal arts and humanities courses is considered to be supplementary. Such biases stem from the colonial mindset of \u201cempiricism\u201d as the metric for \u201cgood\u201d or valuable research. Shibashis Chatterjee, a senior professor at the Department of International Relations at Jadavpur University states that the study of humanities and social sciences has been in a state of worldwide crisis for a while now: \u201cSubjects that do not use quantification are labelled as easy.\u201d However, the professor feels that the idea of a competition amongst arts, science and technology is wrong. \u201cThese are complementary fields. To me, it is an identification problem. If natural sciences set the bar and humanities must measure up to it, there is no way they can meet the standards. Unless we agree to create our own standards, these accusations would never end. Hence, we must stop making these comparisons,\u201d he states. \nThe professor of political thought and critical theory also adds that how society looks at knowledge is a political question. \u201cFrom resource allocation to salaries, the logic of instrumentality trumps everything else,\u201d Chatterjee states. The narratives through which liberal arts courses are shunned are all too familiar. Social sciences never had democratic equality with the natural/biological sciences and technological education. They are dismissed either as questionable or as useless. Modern education is predicated upon science and technology. It has increasingly reduced the space for criticality and reflective variations on the theme of instrumentality, and humanities and social sciences are automatically downgraded. \nIn capitalist societies, education is just another financial sector and the loftier philosophical goals of education \u2013 the pursuance of knowledge and happiness in knowing \u2013 lie discarded. It is significant that the students who pursue humanities do not study for the money. Humanities cannot be made more appealing by tying it to vocational needs. \u201cThat would be sounding the death knell to liberal education,\u201d states Chatterjee. Humanities can flourish when democratic values thrive in society, the spirit of questioning is highly regarded, and liberalism enjoys legitimacy. In other words, if philosophy matters to our lives, humanities is indispensable. \nBut most researchers and students of humanities do not think that any autocratic state would be fundamentally interested in reviving humanities and social sciences since these disciplines encourage critical thinking and questioning of authority structures. The more authoritarian states become, the less tolerant they will be of humanities and social sciences. \nExcerpted from: \nBose, Rakhi. \u201cThe Easy \u2018A\u2019.\u201d Outlook, 11 Jul. 2023, pp. 46-50."

The washing machines on all floors have stopped working, but the hostel authorities have not taken any measures to get them repaired despite repeated pleas by the student community.  \nOne of the elevators in the hostel ceased to work a year ago and has not yet been repaired. Consequently, there is overcrowding in the one available elevator, which, in addition to being inconvenient, is a grave safety hazard. Several toilets in the hostel do not have operational flushes. This causes unsanitary living conditions in the hostel and does not aid the cause of the residents\u2019 well-being. \nInedible and possibly hazardous materials such as strands of a steel scrubber, insects and glass shards have lately been found in the mess food. A sickly looking rat was seen scurrying through the mess hall during dinner time. The green moong dal served in the mess in the past two weeks tasted discernibly stale. As evident from these instances, the mess management is unscrupulously lax in the discharge of their duties. \nThe newly admitted students have been accommodated in rooms without almirahs, tables and chairs. Even after the newly ordered furniture reached the hostel, no provisions were made for its being shifted to the rooms in need. \nI kindly request you to address these pressing concerns with the hostel management and enable their hasty redressal.  \nYours sincerely, [Sign] XYZ General Secretary  Ph: 1234567890",

The washing machines on all floors have stopped working, but the hostel authorities have not taken any measures to get them repaired despite repeated pleas by the student community.  \nOne of the elevators in the hostel ceased to work a year ago and has not yet been repaired. Consequently, there is overcrowding in the one available elevator, which, in addition to being inconvenient, is a grave safety hazard. Several toilets in the hostel do not have operational flushes. This causes unsanitary living conditions in the hostel and does not aid the cause of the residents\u2019 well-being. \nInedible and possibly hazardous materials such as strands of a steel scrubber, insects and glass shards have lately been found in the mess food. A sickly looking rat was seen scurrying through the mess hall during dinner time. The green moong dal served in the mess in the past two weeks tasted discernibly stale. As evident from these instances, the mess management is unscrupulously lax in the discharge of their duties. \nThe newly admitted students have been accommodated in rooms without almirahs, tables and chairs.

        "summary": "Here\u2019s a structured **summary of core topics, concepts, and principles** for the **\"Foundation Level: English I (Computer-Based Exam)\"** based on the provided question paper.\nThe exam tests **vocabulary, grammar, reading comprehension, formal/informal communication, and linguistic analysis** (phonetics, syntax, semantics).\nNo equations are required for this subject, but **rules, definitions, and usage examples** are critical.\n\n---\n\n### **Core Topics & Concepts**\n#### **1. Reading Comprehension**\n   - **Key Skills**:\n     - Identifying **main ideas**, **supporting details**, and **inferences**.\n     - Understanding **author\u2019s tone/purpose** (e.g., critical, persuasive, informative).\n     - Analyzing **vocabulary in context** (e.g., \"appendage,\" \"indispensable,\" \"loftier\").\n     - Matching **adjectives to nouns** (e.g., \"colonial mindset,\" \"liberal arts education\").\n   - **Passage Themes**:\n     - **Bias in education**: Colonial empiricism vs. humanities/social sciences.\n     - **Political implications**: Authoritarianism vs. democratic values in academia.\n     - **Vocational vs. philosophical goals** of education.\n\n   - **Example Questions**:\n     - Why does Chatterjee argue against comparing humanities to natural sciences?\n       \u2192 **Answer**: Humanities cannot meet empirical standards; they must define their own metrics (complementary fields).\n     - What does \"indispensable\" mean?\n       \u2192 **Answer**: Absolutely necessary (not replaceable).\n\n---\n\n#### **2. Grammar & Syntax**\n   - **Subject-Verb Agreement**:\n     - Singular/plural consistency (e.g., \"None of the chairs **needs** repair\").\n     - Collective nouns (e.g., \"All of the hard drives **are** in this box\").\n   - **Tenses**:\n     - **Present Perfect Continuous**: \"I **have been studying** Biology for three hours.\"\n     - **Future Perfect Continuous**: \"She **will have been driving** for an hour by the time she arrives.\"\n   - **Prepositions**:\n     - Correct usage (e.g., \"good **at** swimming,\" \"sitting **on** a bench\").\n   - **Articles**:\n     - \"An\" before vowel **sounds** (e.g., \"an hour\" /a\u028a\u0259r/).\n   - **Modals**:\n     - **Strong warnings**: \"That **will** teach you!\" (not \"shall\").\n   - **Phrasal Verbs**:\n     - \"Held off\" (resisted), \"put on\" (wear), \"let on\" (reveal).\n\n   - **Common Errors**:\n     - Incorrect: \"They **are understanding** the problem.\" (Stative verbs like \"understand\" aren\u2019t used in continuous tenses.)\n     - Correct: \"Their **understanding** of the problem was incorrect.\"\n\n---\n\n#### **3. Vocabulary & Semantics**\n   - **Synonyms/Antonyms**:\n     - \"Appendage\" \u2248 addition/attachment (\u2260 \"approbation\").\n     - \"Indispensable\" = essential.\n     - \"Loftier\" (comparative) \u2192 \"lofty\" (positive).\n   - **Idioms/Phrases**:\n     - \"Out of my league\" (too advanced).\n     - \"In the clear\" (not guilty).\n     - \"Bite the bullet\" (endure pain).\n   - **Word Stress**:\n     - **Noun vs. Verb**: \"DEcrease\" (noun) vs. \"deCREASE\" (verb).\n     - **Compound Words**: \"FOOTball\" (stress on first syllable).\n\n---\n\n#### **4. Formal vs. Informal Communication**\n   - **Formal Letters**:\n     - **Structure**: Sender\u2019s address \u2192 Date \u2192 Recipient\u2019s address \u2192 Salutation (\"Respected Sir\") \u2192 Body (clear, concise, polite) \u2192 Closing (\"Yours sincerely\").\n     - **Purpose**: Complaints/requests (e.g., hostel facilities).\n     - **Tone**: Impersonal, factual, urgent (e.g., \"I **kindly request** you to address these concerns\").\n     - **Transitions**: \"Consequently,\" \"As evident from these instances.\"\n   - **Telephonic Conversations**:\n     - Polite phrases:\n       - \"I **would like to** book an appointment.\"\n       - \"Could you **repeat that**, please?\" (not \"Speak up!\")\n     - Avoid slang (\"wanna,\" \"cool\").\n\n   - **Example**:\n     - **Informal**: \"Hey, is Dr. Agarwal there?\"\n     - **Formal**: \"Hello, I\u2019d like to schedule an appointment with Dr. Agarwal, please.\"\n\n---\n\n#### **5. Phonetics & Linguistics**\n   - **Consonant Clusters**:\n     - \"Against\" = **final CCC** (/\u0261\u025bnst/).\n   - **Semi-Vowels**:\n     - /y/ in \"he arrived\" (/hi y\u0259\u02c8ra\u026avd/).\n   - **Aspiration**:\n     - /p/ in \"people\" \u2192 **first syllable aspirated** (/\u02c8pi\u02d0p\u0259l/).\n   - **Syllables**:\n     - \"Compensation\" = **4 syllables** (com-pen-sa-tion).\n\n---\n\n#### **6. Writing Skills**\n   - **Argumentative Strategies**:\n     - **Examples** (most used in the hostel letter).\n     - **Transitions**: \"Consequently,\" \"Additionally.\"\n   - **Clarity & Purpose**:\n     - Listing issues (e.g., broken elevators, unsanitary mess) **supports the topic sentence**.\n   - **Avoiding Definitions**:\n     - The hostel letter uses **examples**, not dictionary definitions.\n\n---\n\n### **Mermaid Knowledge Graphs**\n#### **1.
