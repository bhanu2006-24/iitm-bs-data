Such biases stem from the colonial mindset of \u201cempiricism\u201d as the metric for \u201cgood\u201d or valuable research. Shibashis Chatterjee, a senior professor at the Department of International Relations at Jadavpur University states that the study of humanities and social sciences has been in a state of worldwide crisis for a while now: \u201cSubjects that do not use quantification are labelled as easy.\u201d However, the professor feels that the idea of a competition amongst arts, science and technology is wrong. \u201cThese are complementary fields. To me, it is an identification problem. If natural sciences set the bar and humanities must measure up to it, there is no way they can meet the standards. Unless we agree to create our own standards, these accusations would never end. Hence, we must stop making these comparisons,\u201d he states. \nThe professor of political thought and critical theory also adds that how society looks at knowledge is a political question. \u201cFrom resource allocation to salaries, the logic of instrumentality trumps everything else,\u201d Chatterjee states. The narratives through which liberal arts courses are shunned are all too familiar. Social sciences never had democratic equality with the natural/biological sciences and technological education. They are dismissed either as questionable or as useless. Modern education is predicated upon science and technology. It has increasingly reduced the space for criticality and reflective variations on the theme of instrumentality, and humanities and social sciences are automatically downgraded. \nIn capitalist societies, education is just another financial sector and the loftier philosophical goals of education \u2013 the pursuance of knowledge and happiness in knowing \u2013 lie discarded. It is significant that the students who pursue humanities do not study for the money. Humanities cannot be made more appealing by tying it to vocational needs. \u201cThat would be sounding the death knell to liberal education,\u201d states Chatterjee. Humanities can flourish when democratic values thrive in society, the spirit of questioning is highly regarded, and liberalism enjoys legitimacy. In other words, if philosophy matters to our lives, humanities is indispensable. \nBut most researchers and students of humanities do not think that any autocratic state would be fundamentally interested in reviving humanities and social sciences since these disciplines encourage critical thinking and questioning of authority structures. The more authoritarian states become, the less tolerant they will be of humanities and social sciences. \nExcerpted from: \nBose, Rakhi. \u201cThe Easy \u2018A\u2019.\u201d Outlook, 11 Jul. 2023, pp. 46-50."

Even the content in liberal arts and humanities courses is considered to be supplementary. Such biases stem from the colonial mindset of \u201cempiricism\u201d as the metric for \u201cgood\u201d or valuable research. Shibashis Chatterjee, a senior professor at the Department of International Relations at Jadavpur University states that the study of humanities and social sciences has been in a state of worldwide crisis for a while now: \u201cSubjects that do not use quantification are labelled as easy.\u201d However, the professor feels that the idea of a competition amongst arts, science and technology is wrong. \u201cThese are complementary fields. To me, it is an identification problem. If natural sciences set the bar and humanities must measure up to it, there is no way they can meet the standards. Unless we agree to create our own standards, these accusations would never end. Hence, we must stop making these comparisons,\u201d he states. \nThe professor of political thought and critical theory also adds that how society looks at knowledge is a political question. \u201cFrom resource allocation to salaries, the logic of instrumentality trumps everything else,\u201d Chatterjee states. The narratives through which liberal arts courses are shunned are all too familiar. Social sciences never had democratic equality with the natural/biological sciences and technological education. They are dismissed either as questionable or as useless. Modern education is predicated upon science and technology. It has increasingly reduced the space for criticality and reflective variations on the theme of instrumentality, and humanities and social sciences are automatically downgraded. \nIn capitalist societies, education is just another financial sector and the loftier philosophical goals of education \u2013 the pursuance of knowledge and happiness in knowing \u2013 lie discarded. It is significant that the students who pursue humanities do not study for the money. Humanities cannot be made more appealing by tying it to vocational needs. \u201cThat would be sounding the death knell to liberal education,\u201d states Chatterjee. Humanities can flourish when democratic values thrive in society, the spirit of questioning is highly regarded, and liberalism enjoys legitimacy. In other words, if philosophy matters to our lives, humanities is indispensable. \nBut most researchers and students of humanities do not think that any autocratic state would be fundamentally interested in reviving humanities and social sciences since these disciplines encourage critical thinking and questioning of authority structures. The more authoritarian states become, the less tolerant they will be of humanities and social sciences. \nExcerpted from: \nBose, Rakhi. \u201cThe Easy \u2018A\u2019.\u201d Outlook, 11 Jul. 2023, pp. 46-50."

The washing machines on all floors have stopped working, but the hostel authorities have not taken any measures to get them repaired despite repeated pleas by the student community.  \nOne of the elevators in the hostel ceased to work a year ago and has not yet been repaired. Consequently, there is overcrowding in the one available elevator, which, in addition to being inconvenient, is a grave safety hazard. Several toilets in the hostel do not have operational flushes. This causes unsanitary living conditions in the hostel and does not aid the cause of the residents\u2019 well-being. \nInedible and possibly hazardous materials such as strands of a steel scrubber, insects and glass shards have lately been found in the mess food. A sickly looking rat was seen scurrying through the mess hall during dinner time. The green moong dal served in the mess in the past two weeks tasted discernibly stale. As evident from these instances, the mess management is unscrupulously lax in the discharge of their duties. \nThe newly admitted students have been accommodated in rooms without almirahs, tables and chairs. Even after the newly ordered furniture reached the hostel, no provisions were made for its being shifted to the rooms in need. \nI kindly request you to address these pressing concerns with the hostel management and enable their hasty redressal.  \nYours sincerely, [Sign] XYZ General Secretary  Ph: 1234567890",

The washing machines on all floors have stopped working, but the hostel authorities have not taken any measures to get them repaired despite repeated pleas by the student community.  \nOne of the elevators in the hostel ceased to work a year ago and has not yet been repaired. Consequently, there is overcrowding in the one available elevator, which, in addition to being inconvenient, is a grave safety hazard. Several toilets in the hostel do not have operational flushes. This causes unsanitary living conditions in the hostel and does not aid the cause of the residents\u2019 well-being. \nInedible and possibly hazardous materials such as strands of a steel scrubber, insects and glass shards have lately been found in the mess food. A sickly looking rat was seen scurrying through the mess hall during dinner time. The green moong dal served in the mess in the past two weeks tasted discernibly stale. As evident from these instances, the mess management is unscrupulously lax in the discharge of their duties. \nThe newly admitted students have been accommodated in rooms without almirahs, tables and chairs. Even after the newly ordered furniture reached the hostel, no provisions were made for its being shifted to the rooms in need. \nI kindly request you to address these pressing concerns with the hostel management and enable their hasty redressal.  \nYours sincerely, [Sign] XYZ General Secretary  Ph: 1234567890",

The washing machines on all floors have stopped working, but the hostel authorities have not taken any measures to get them repaired despite repeated pleas by the student community.  \nOne of the elevators in the hostel ceased to work a year ago and has not yet been repaired. Consequently, there is overcrowding in the one available elevator, which, in addition to being inconvenient, is a grave safety hazard. Several toilets in the hostel do not have operational flushes. This causes unsanitary living conditions in the hostel and does not aid the cause of the residents\u2019 well-being. \nInedible and possibly hazardous materials such as strands of a steel scrubber, insects and glass shards have lately been found in the mess food. A sickly looking rat was seen scurrying through the mess hall during dinner time. The green moong dal served in the mess in the past two weeks tasted discernibly stale. As evident from these instances, the mess management is unscrupulously lax in the discharge of their duties. \nThe newly admitted students have been accommodated in rooms without almirahs, tables and chairs. Even after the newly ordered furniture reached the hostel, no provisions were made for its being shifted to the rooms in need. \nI kindly request you to address these pressing concerns with the hostel management and enable their hasty redressal.  \nYours sincerely, [Sign] XYZ General Secretary  Ph: 1234567890"

The washing machines on all floors have stopped working, but the hostel authorities have not taken any measures to get them repaired despite repeated pleas by the student community.  \nOne of the elevators in the hostel ceased to work a year ago and has not yet been repaired. Consequently, there is overcrowding in the one available elevator, which, in addition to being inconvenient, is a grave safety hazard. Several toilets in the hostel do not have operational flushes. This causes unsanitary living conditions in the hostel and does not aid the cause of the residents\u2019 well-being. \nInedible and possibly hazardous materials such as strands of a steel scrubber, insects and glass shards have lately been found in the mess food. A sickly looking rat was seen scurrying through the mess hall during dinner time. The green moong dal served in the mess in the past two weeks tasted discernibly stale. As evident from these instances, the mess management is unscrupulously lax in the discharge of their duties. \nThe newly admitted students have been accommodated in rooms without almirahs, tables and chairs. Even after the newly ordered furniture reached the hostel, no provisions were made for its being shifted to the rooms in need. \nI kindly request you to address these pressing concerns with the hostel management and enable their hasty redressal.  \nYours sincerely, [Sign] XYZ General Secretary  Ph: 1234567890",

        "summary": "Here\u2019s a structured **summary of core topics, concepts, and principles** for the **\"English I (Computer-Based Exam)\"** based on the provided question paper.\nThe exam focuses on **reading comprehension, grammar, vocabulary, formal writing, and linguistic concepts**. Below is a breakdown of key areas, followed by a **Mermaid knowledge graph** to visualize relationships.\n\n---\n\n### **Core Topics & Concepts**\n#### **1. Reading Comprehension**\n- **Passage Analysis**:\n  - Identify **main ideas**, **supporting details**, **inferences**, and **author\u2019s tone/purpose**.\n  - Example: Passage on **\"The Easy \u2018A\u2019\"** (humanities vs. sciences, colonial mindset, empiricism, democratic values).\n  - Key themes:\n    - **Bias against humanities/social sciences** (seen as \"easy\" or supplementary).\n    - **Empiricism as a colonial metric** for \"good\" research.\n    - **Complementarity of arts, science, and technology** (not competitive).\n    - **Political implications** of knowledge (resource allocation, authoritarianism vs. democracy).\n    - **Vocationalism vs. liberal education** (humanities flourish under democratic values).\n\n- **Vocabulary in Context**:\n  - Synonyms/antonyms (e.g., \"appendage\" \u2260 \"approbation\").\n  - Word forms (e.g., \"loftier\" \u2192 positive form \"lofty\").\n  - Definitions (e.g., \"indispensable\" = absolutely necessary).\n\n- **Grammar in Context**:\n  - Parts of speech (e.g., \"biases\" = plural noun).\n  - Tense consistency (e.g., past perfect, present perfect continuous).\n\n---\n\n#### **2. Grammar**\n##### **A. Subject-Verb Agreement**\n- Rules:\n  - Singular subjects \u2192 singular verbs (e.g., \"None of the chairs **needs** repair\").\n  - Plural subjects \u2192 plural verbs (e.g., \"All of the hard drives **are** in this box\").\n  - Collective nouns (e.g., \"The team **is** winning\").\n- Exceptions:\n  - \"None\" can be singular/plural depending on context (formal writing prefers singular).\n  - Uncountable nouns (e.g., \"furniture **is**\").\n\n##### **B. Tenses**\n- **Present Perfect Continuous**: Action started in the past and continues (e.g., \"I **have been studying** Biology for 3 hours\").\n- **Future Perfect Continuous**: Action will be ongoing until a future time (e.g., \"She **will have been driving** for an hour by the time she arrives\").\n- **Past Simple vs. Present Continuous**:\n  - Incorrect: \"They **are understanding** the problem.\" (Stative verbs like \"understand\" aren\u2019t used in continuous tenses).\n  - Correct: \"Their **understanding** of the problem was incorrect.\"\n\n##### **C. Prepositions**\n- Common pairs:\n  - Good **at** (skills): \"She is good **at** swimming.\"\n  - Interested **in**: \"He is interested **in** science.\"\n  - Afraid **of**: \"She is afraid **of** spiders.\"\n\n##### **D. Articles**\n- **A vs. An**:\n  - Use \"an\" before **vowel sounds** (not just vowels): \"an hour\" (/a\u028a\u0259r/ starts with a vowel sound).\n- **Definite vs. Indefinite**:\n  - \"The\" for specific nouns; \"a/an\" for general.\n\n##### **E. Modals**\n- **Strong warnings**: \"That **will** teach you!\" (not \"can/shall/may\").\n- **Possibility/Ability**: \"Can,\" \"could,\" \"may.\"\n- **Obligation**: \"Must,\" \"have to.\"\n\n##### **F. Phrasal Verbs**\n- Examples:\n  - \"Hold off\" = resist/defend (e.g., \"The army **held off** the aggressors\").\n  - \"Put on\" = wear/activate.\n  - \"Let on\" = reveal a secret.\n\n##### **G. Idioms**\n| Idiom               | Meaning                                  | Example Sentence                          |\n|---------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| Out of my league    | Too good/not comparable                  | \"The project was out of my league.\"      |\n| In the clear        | Not guilty                               | \"He was in the clear after the trial.\"   |\n| Bite the bullet     | Endure a painful situation               | \"I bit the bullet and apologized.\"       |\n| Bell the cat        | Take on a risky task                     | \"Who will bell the cat and complain?\"    |\n\n---\n\n#### **3. Formal Writing (Letters)**\n##### **A. Structure of a Formal Letter**\n1. **Sender\u2019s Address** (top-left).\n2. **Date**.\n3. **Recipient\u2019s Address**.\n4. **Subject Line** (clear and concise).\n5. **Salutation**: \"Respected Sir/Madam,\" or \"Dear [Title + Name],\".\n6. **Body**:\n   - **Introduction**: State purpose (e.g., \"I am writing to draw your attention to...\").\n   - **Details**: List issues with **examples** (e.g., broken elevators, unsanitary mess).\n   - **Conclusion**: Polite request for action (e.g., \"I kindly request you to address these concerns\").\n7. **Closing**: \"Yours sincerely,\" or \"Yours faithfully,\".\n8. **Signature + Name + Designation**.\n\n##### **B. Key Features**\n- **Tone**: Polite, impersonal, and professional.\n- **Clarity**: Avoid ambiguity (e.g., list lacking amenities explicitly).\n- **Transitions**: Use phrases like \"Consequently,\" \"As evident from these instances,\".\n- **Urgency**: Highlight time-sensitive issues (e.g., \"hasty redressal\").\n- **First Person (\"I\")**: Acceptable if representing a group (e.g., \"I, as General Secretary, request...\").\n\n##### **C. Common Mistakes to Avoid**\n- Informal language (e.g., \"wanna,\" \"cool\").\n- Vague statements (e.g., \"Things are bad\" \u2192 \"The toilets lack operational flushes\").\n- Lack of examples/specifics.\n\n---\n\n#### **4. Vocabulary & Word Usage**\n##### **A. Synonyms/Antonyms**\n| Word        | Synonym               | Antonym          |\n|-------------|-----------------------|------------------|\n| Appendage   | Addition, accessory   | Core             |\n| Indispensable | Essential, necessary | Dispensable      |\n| Lofty       | Elevated, noble       | Lowly            |\n| Lax         | Lenient, negligent     | Strict           |\n\n##### **B. Word Forms**\n- **Adjectives \u2192 Nouns**:\n  - Critical \u2192 Criticism/Theory.\n  - Liberal \u2192 Liberalism/Arts Education.\n  - Colonial \u2192 Mindset.\n  - Valuable \u2192 Research.\n  - Financial \u2192 Sector.\n\n##### **C. Concrete vs. Abstract Nouns**\n- **Concrete**: Tangible (e.g., \"mountain,\" \"jug\").\n- **Abstract**: Intangible (e.g., \"love,\" \"freedom\").\n\n##### **D. Adverbs**\n- **Place**: \"abroad,\" \"here,\" \"there.\"\n- **Manner**: \"happily,\" \"beautifully.\"\n- **Time**: \"late,\" \"now.\"\n\n---\n\n#### **5. Linguistics**\n##### **A. Phonetics**\n- **Syllables**:\n  - \"Compensation\" = 4 syllables (com-pen-sa-tion).\n  - \"Football\" = stress on **first syllable** (FOOT-ball).\n- **Consonant Clusters**:\n  - \"Against\" = **final CCC** (/\u0261\u025bnst/).\n- **Aspiration**:\n  - /p/ in \"people\" \u2192 **first syllable** is aspirated (/pi\u02d0p\u0259l/).\n- **Semi-Vowels**:\n  - /y/ (palatal glide) in \"he arrived\" (/hi\u02d0 j\u0259\u02c8ra\u026avd/).\n\n##### **B. Stress Patterns**\n- **Noun vs. Verb Stress**:\n  - **DEcrease** (noun) vs. de**CREASE** (verb).\n  - Example: \"There has been a **DEcrease** in sales.\"\n\n---\n\n#### **6. Sentence Structure**\n##### **A. Sentence Types**\n- **Topic Sentence**: Statement introducing the main idea (e.g., \"Narmada Hostel lacks necessary facilities\").\n- **Supporting Sentences**: Examples/details (e.g., \"The washing machines on all floors have stopped working...\").\n- **Transitions**: \"Consequently,\" \"Additionally,\" \"As evident from...\".\n\n##### **B. Common Errors**\n- **Double Negatives**: Incorrect: \"I don\u2019t have no time.\" \u2192 Correct: \"I don\u2019t have any time.\"\n- **Misplaced Modifiers**: Incorrect: \"She almost drove her kids to school every day.\" (Implies she didn\u2019t drive them) \u2192 Correct: \"She drove her kids to school almost every day.\"\n- **Passive Voice Overuse**: Prefer active voice for clarity (e.g., \"The hostel authorities **ignored** requests\" vs. \"Requests were ignored by the hostel authorities\").\n\n---\n\n### **Mermaid Knowledge Graphs**\n#### **Graph 1: Reading Comprehension & Vocabulary**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Reading Comprehension] --> B[Passage Analysis]\n    A --> C[Vocabulary in Context]\n    B --> D[Main Idea]\n    B --> E[Supporting Details]\n    B --> F[Inferences]\n    B --> G[Author's Tone]\n    C --> H[Synonyms/Antonyms]\n    C --> I[Word Forms]\n    C --> J[Definitions]\n    D --> K[\"Humanities vs. Sciences Bias\"]\n    E --> L[\"Empiricism as Colonial Metric\"]\n    E --> M[\"Examples: Broken Elevators, Unsanitary Mess\"]\n    G --> N[\"Critical vs. Authoritarian Societies\"]\n```\n\n#### **Graph 2: Grammar**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Grammar] --> B[Subject-Verb Agreement]\n    A --> C[Tenses]\n    A --> D[Prepositions]\n    A --> E[Articles]\n    A --> F[Modals]\n    A --> G[Phrasal Verbs]\n    B --> H[\"Singular/Plural Rules\"]\n    B --> I[\"None + Singular Verb\"]\n    C --> J[Present Perfect Continuous]\n    C --> K[Future Perfect Continuous]\n    C --> L[Stative Verbs]\n    D --> M[\"Good at/in/for\"]\n    E --> N[\"A vs. An: Vowel Sounds\"]\n    F --> O[\"Will for Warnings\"]\n    G --> P[\"Hold off, Put on\"]\n```\n\n#### **Graph 3: Formal Writing**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Formal Letter] --> B[Structure]\n    A --> C[Tone]\n    A --> D[Transitions]\n    A --> E[Urgency]\n    B --> F[Sender's Address]\n    B --> G[Recipient's Address]\n    B --> H[Subject Line]\n    B --> I[Salutation]\n    B --> J[Body: Introduction/Details/Conclusion]\n    B --> K[Closing]\n    C --> L[Polite/Impersonal]\n    D --> M[\"Consequently, As evident from...\"]\n    E --> N[\"Hasty Redressal, Pressing Concerns\"]\n```\n\n#### **Graph 4: Linguistics**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Linguistics] --> B[Phonetics]\n    A --> C[Syllables]\n    A --> D[Stress Patterns]\n    B --> E[Consonant Clusters]\n    B --> F[Aspiration]\n    B --> G[Semi-Vowels]\n    E --> H[\"Against: Final CCC\"]\n    F --> I[\"/p/ in 'people': First Syllable\"]\n    G --> J[\"/y/ in 'he arrived'\"]\n    C --> K[\"Compensation: 4 Syllables\"]\n    D --> L[\"DEcrease (noun) vs. deCREASE (verb)\"]\n```\n\n---\n### **Key Equations/Rules (Grammar & Linguistics)**\n1. **Subject-Verb Agreement**:\n   - Singular: `Subject (he/she/it) + Verb(s)` \u2192 \"She **runs**.\"\n   - Plural: `Subject (they/we) + Verb(base)` \u2192 \"They **run**.\"\n   - Exception: `None of the + plural noun + singular verb` \u2192 \"None of the chairs **needs** repair.\"\n\n2. **Present Perfect Continuous**:\n   - `Subject + have/has + been + Verb(ing)` \u2192 \"I **have been studying**.\"\n\n3. **Future Perfect Continuous**:\n   - `Subject + will + have + been + Verb(ing)` \u2192 \"She **will have been driving**.\"\n\n4. **Articles**:\n   - `a + consonant sound` / `an + vowel sound` \u2192 \"a university\" (/ju\u02d0n\u026a\u02c8v\u025c\u02d0s\u026ati/ starts with /j/), \"an hour\" (/a\u028a\u0259r/).\n\n5. **Syllable Count**:\n   - Vowels (a, e, i, o, u) and sometimes 'y' \u2192 \"Compensation\" = com-pen-sa-tion (4).\n\n6. **Stress Patterns**:\n   - Nouns: Stress on **first syllable** (e.g., **RE-cord**).\n   - Verbs: Stress on **second syllable** (e.g., re-**CORD**).",
