I jotted down the title in my notebook, tucked it in my bag and tried to keep quiet.  That evening, after I\u2019d finished the rest of my homework, the note about the essay caught my eye. I began thinking about the subject while chewing the tip of my fountain pen. Anyone could ramble on and leave big spaces between the words, but the trick was to come up with convincing arguments to prove the necessity of talking. I thought and thought, and suddenly I had an idea. I wrote the three pages Mr Keesing had assigned me and was satisfied. I argued that talking is a student\u2019s trait and that I would do my best to keep it under control but that I would never be able to cure myself of the habit since my mother talked as much as I did if not more, and that there\u2019s not much you can do about inherited traits.  Mr Keesing had a good laugh at my arguments, but when I proceeded to talk my way through the next lesson, he assigned me a second essay. This time it was supposed to be on \u2018An Incorrigible Chatterbox\u2019. I handed it in, and Mr Keesing had nothing to complain about for two whole lessons.

I began thinking about the subject while chewing the tip of my fountain pen. Anyone could ramble on and leave big spaces between the words, but the trick was to come up with convincing arguments to prove the necessity of talking. I thought and thought, and suddenly I had an idea. I wrote the three pages Mr Keesing had assigned me and was satisfied. I argued that talking is a student\u2019s trait and that I would do my best to keep it under control but that I would never be able to cure myself of the habit since my mother talked as much as I did if not more, and that there\u2019s not much you can do about inherited traits.  Mr Keesing had a good laugh at my arguments, but when I proceeded to talk my way through the next lesson, he assigned me a second essay.

I began thinking about the subject while chewing the tip of my fountain pen. Anyone could ramble on and leave big spaces between the words, but the trick was to come up with convincing arguments to prove the necessity of talking. I thought and thought, and suddenly I had an idea. I wrote the three pages Mr Keesing had assigned me and was satisfied. I argued that talking is a student\u2019s trait and that I would do my best to keep it under control but that I would never be able to cure myself of the habit since my mother talked as much as I did if not more, and that there\u2019s not much you can do about inherited traits.

                            "Read the following passage and answer the given subquestions  Dearest Kitty,  Our entire class is quaking in its boots. The reason, of course, is the forthcoming meeting in which the teachers decide who\u2019ll move up to the next form and who\u2019ll be kept back. Half the class is making bets. G.N. and I laugh ourselves silly at the two boys behind us, C.N. and Jacques, who have staked their entire holiday savings on their bet. From morning to night, it\u2019s \u201cYou\u2019re going to pass\u201d, \u201cNo, I\u2019m not\u201d, \u201cYes, you are\u201d, \u201cNo, I\u2019m not\u201d. Even G.\u2019s pleading glances and my angry outbursts can\u2019t calm them down. If you ask me, there are so many dummies that about a quarter of the class should be kept back, but teachers are the most unpredictable creatures on earth.  I\u2019m not so worried about my girlfriends and myself. We\u2019ll make it. The only subject I\u2019m not sure about is maths. Anyway, all we can do is wait. Until then, we keep telling each other not to lose heart.  I get along pretty well with all my teachers. There are nine of them, seven men and two women. Mr Keesing, the old fogey who teaches maths, was annoyed with me for ages because I talked so much. After several warnings, he assigned me extra homework. An essay on the subject, \u2018A Chatterbox\u2019. A chatterbox \u2014 what can you write about that? I\u2019d worry about that later, I decided. I jotted down the title in my notebook, tucked it in my bag and tried to keep quiet.  That evening, after I\u2019d finished the rest of my homework, the note about the essay caught my eye. I began thinking about the subject while chewing the tip of my fountain pen. Anyone could ramble on and leave big spaces between the words, but the trick was to come up with convincing arguments to prove the necessity of talking. I thought and thought, and suddenly I had an idea. I wrote the three pages Mr Keesing had assigned me and was satisfied. I argued that talking is a student\u2019s trait and that I would do my best to keep it under control but that I would never be able to cure myself of the habit since my mother talked as much as I did if not more, and that there\u2019s not much you can do about inherited traits.  Mr Keesing had a good laugh at my arguments, but when I proceeded to talk my way through the next lesson, he assigned me a second essay. This time it was supposed to be on \u2018An Incorrigible Chatterbox\u2019. I handed it in, and Mr Keesing had nothing to complain about for two whole lessons. However, during the third lesson he\u2019d finally had enough. \u201cAnne Frank, as punishment for talking in class, write an essay entitled \u2014 \u2018Quack, Quack, Quack, Said Mistress Chatterbox\u2019.\u201d"

I jotted down the title in my notebook, tucked it in my bag and tried to keep quiet.  That evening, after I\u2019d finished the rest of my homework, the note about the essay caught my eye. I began thinking about the subject while chewing the tip of my fountain pen. Anyone could ramble on and leave big spaces between the words, but the trick was to come up with convincing arguments to prove the necessity of talking. I thought and thought, and suddenly I had an idea. I wrote the three pages Mr Keesing had assigned me and was satisfied. I argued that talking is a student\u2019s trait and that I would do my best to keep it under control but that I would never be able to cure myself of the habit since my mother talked as much as I did if not more, and that there\u2019s not much you can do about inherited traits.  Mr Keesing had a good laugh at my arguments, but when I proceeded to talk my way through the next lesson, he assigned me a second essay. This time it was supposed to be on \u2018An Incorrigible Chatterbox\u2019. I handed it in, and Mr Keesing had nothing to complain about for two whole lessons. However, during the third lesson he\u2019d finally had enough. \u201cAnne Frank, as punishment for talking in class, write an essay entitled \u2014 \u2018Quack, Quack, Quack, Said Mistress Chatterbox\u2019.\u201d"

I argued that talking is a student\u2019s trait and that I would do my best to keep it under control but that I would never be able to cure myself of the habit since my mother talked as much as I did if not more, and that there\u2019s not much you can do about inherited traits.  Mr Keesing had a good laugh at my arguments, but when I proceeded to talk my way through the next lesson, he assigned me a second essay. This time it was supposed to be on \u2018An Incorrigible Chatterbox\u2019. I handed it in, and Mr Keesing had nothing to complain about for two whole lessons. However, during the third lesson he\u2019d finally had enough. \u201cAnne Frank, as punishment for talking in class, write an essay entitled \u2014 \u2018Quack, Quack, Quack, Said Mistress Chatterbox\u2019.\u201d"
