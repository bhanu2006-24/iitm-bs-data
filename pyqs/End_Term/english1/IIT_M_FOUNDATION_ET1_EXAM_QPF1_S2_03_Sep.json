Hamel had said that he would question us on participles, and I did not know the first word about them. For a moment I thought of running away and spending the day out of doors. It was so warm, so bright! The birds were chirping at the edge of the woods; and in the open field back of the sawmill the Prussian soldiers were drilling. It was all much more tempting than the rule for participles, but I had the strength to resist, and hurried off to school.  When I passed the town hall there was a crowd in front of the bulletin-board. For the last two years all our bad news had come from there \u2014 the lost battles, the draft, the orders of the commanding officer \u2014 and I thought to myself, without stopping, \u201cWhat can be the matter now?\u201d  Then, as I hurried by as fast as I could go, the blacksmith, Wachter, who was there, with his apprentice, reading the bulletin, called after me, \u201cDon\u2019t go so fast, bub; you\u2019ll get to your school in plenty of time!\u201d  I thought he was making fun of me, and reached M. Hamel\u2019s little garden all out of breath.  Usually, when school began, there was a great bustle, which could be heard out in the street, the opening and closing of desks, lessons repeated in unison, very loud, with our hands over our ears to understand better, and the teacher\u2019s great ruler rapping on the table. But now it was all so still! I had counted on the commotion to get to my desk without being seen; but, of course, that day everything had to be as quiet as Sunday morning. Through the window I saw my classmates, already in their places, and M. Hamel walking up and down with his terrible iron ruler under his arm. I had to open the door and go in before everybody. You can imagine how I blushed and how frightened I was.  But nothing happened. M. Hamel saw me and said very kindly, \u201cGo to your place quickly, little Franz. We were beginning without you.\u201d I jumped over the bench and sat down at my desk.  - The Last Lesson- Alphonse Daudet",

Hamel had said that he would question us on participles, and I did not know the first word about them. For a moment I thought of running away and spending the day out of doors. It was so warm, so bright! The birds were chirping at the edge of the woods; and in the open field back of the sawmill the Prussian soldiers were drilling. It was all much more tempting than the rule for participles, but I had the strength to resist, and hurried off to school.  When I passed the town hall there was a crowd in front of the bulletin-board. For the last two years all our bad news had come from there \u2014 the lost battles, the draft, the orders of the commanding officer \u2014 and I thought to myself, without stopping, \u201cWhat can be the matter now?\u201d  Then, as I hurried by as fast as I could go, the blacksmith, Wachter, who was there, with his apprentice, reading the bulletin, called after me, \u201cDon\u2019t go so fast, bub; you\u2019ll get to your school in plenty of time!\u201d  I thought he was making fun of me, and reached M. Hamel\u2019s little garden all out of breath.  Usually, when school began, there was a great bustle, which could be heard out in the street, the opening and closing of desks, lessons repeated in unison, very loud, with our hands over our ears to understand better, and the teacher\u2019s great ruler rapping on the table. But now it was all so still! I had counted on the commotion to get to my desk without being seen; but, of course, that day everything had to be as quiet as Sunday morning. Through the window I saw my classmates, already in their places, and M. Hamel walking up and down with his terrible iron ruler under his arm. I had to open the door and go in before everybody. You can imagine how I blushed and how frightened I was.  But nothing happened. M. Hamel saw me and said very kindly, \u201cGo to your place quickly, little Franz. We were beginning without you.\u201d I jumped over the bench and sat down at my desk.  - The Last Lesson- Alphonse Daudet",

Hamel had said that he would question us on participles, and I did not know the first word about them. For a moment I thought of running away and spending the day out of doors. It was so warm, so bright! The birds were chirping at the edge of the woods; and in the open field back of the sawmill the Prussian soldiers were drilling. It was all much more tempting than the rule for participles, but I had the strength to resist, and hurried off to school.  When I passed the town hall there was a crowd in front of the bulletin-board. For the last two years all our bad news had come from there \u2014 the lost battles, the draft, the orders of the commanding officer \u2014 and I thought to myself, without stopping, \u201cWhat can be the matter now?\u201d  Then, as I hurried by as fast as I could go, the blacksmith, Wachter, who was there, with his apprentice, reading the bulletin, called after me, \u201cDon\u2019t go so fast, bub; you\u2019ll get to your school in plenty of time!\u201d  I thought he was making fun of me, and reached M. Hamel\u2019s little garden all out of breath.  Usually, when school began, there was a great bustle, which could be heard out in the street, the opening and closing of desks, lessons repeated in unison, very loud, with our hands over our ears to understand better, and the teacher\u2019s great ruler rapping on the table. But now it was all so still! I had counted on the commotion to get to my desk without being seen; but, of course, that day everything had to be as quiet as Sunday morning. Through the window I saw my classmates, already in their places, and M. Hamel walking up and down with his terrible iron ruler under his arm. I had to open the door and go in before everybody. You can imagine how I blushed and how frightened I was.  But nothing happened. M. Hamel saw me and said very kindly, \u201cGo to your place quickly, little Franz.

Hamel had said that he would question us on participles, and I did not know the first word about them. For a moment I thought of running away and spending the day out of doors. It was so warm, so bright! The birds were chirping at the edge of the woods; and in the open field back of the sawmill the Prussian soldiers were drilling. It was all much more tempting than the rule for participles, but I had the strength to resist, and hurried off to school.  When I passed the town hall there was a crowd in front of the bulletin-board. For the last two years all our bad news had come from there \u2014 the lost battles, the draft, the orders of the commanding officer \u2014 and I thought to myself, without stopping, \u201cWhat can be the matter now?\u201d  Then, as I hurried by as fast as I could go, the blacksmith, Wachter, who was there, with his apprentice, reading the bulletin, called after me, \u201cDon\u2019t go so fast, bub; you\u2019ll get to your school in plenty of time!\u201d  I thought he was making fun of me, and reached M. Hamel\u2019s little garden all out of breath.  Usually, when school began, there was a great bustle, which could be heard out in the street, the opening and closing of desks, lessons repeated in unison, very loud, with our hands over our ears to understand better, and the teacher\u2019s great ruler rapping on the table. But now it was all so still! I had counted on the commotion to get to my desk without being seen; but, of course, that day everything had to be as quiet as Sunday morning. Through the window I saw my classmates, already in their places, and M. Hamel walking up and down with his terrible iron ruler under his arm. I had to open the door and go in before everybody. You can imagine how I blushed and how frightened I was.  But nothing happened. M. Hamel saw me and said very kindly, \u201cGo to your place quickly, little Franz. We were beginning without you.\u201d I jumped over the bench and sat down at my desk.  - The Last Lesson- Alphonse Daudet",

Hamel had said that he would question us on participles, and I did not know the first word about them. For a moment I thought of running away and spending the day out of doors. It was so warm, so bright! The birds were chirping at the edge of the woods; and in the open field back of the sawmill the Prussian soldiers were drilling. It was all much more tempting than the rule for participles, but I had the strength to resist, and hurried off to school.  When I passed the town hall there was a crowd in front of the bulletin-board. For the last two years all our bad news had come from there \u2014 the lost battles, the draft, the orders of the commanding officer \u2014 and I thought to myself, without stopping, \u201cWhat can be the matter now?\u201d  Then, as I hurried by as fast as I could go, the blacksmith, Wachter, who was there, with his apprentice, reading the bulletin, called after me, \u201cDon\u2019t go so fast, bub; you\u2019ll get to your school in plenty of time!\u201d  I thought he was making fun of me, and reached M. Hamel\u2019s little garden all out of breath.  Usually, when school began, there was a great bustle, which could be heard out in the street, the opening and closing of desks, lessons repeated in unison, very loud, with our hands over our ears to understand better, and the teacher\u2019s great ruler rapping on the table. But now it was all so still! I had counted on the commotion to get to my desk without being seen; but, of course, that day everything had to be as quiet as Sunday morning. Through the window I saw my classmates, already in their places, and M. Hamel walking up and down with his terrible iron ruler under his arm. I had to open the door and go in before everybody. You can imagine how I blushed and how frightened I was.  But nothing happened. M. Hamel saw me and said very kindly, \u201cGo to your place quickly, little Franz.

Hamel had said that he would question us on participles, and I did not know the first word about them. For a moment I thought of running away and spending the day out of doors. It was so warm, so bright! The birds were chirping at the edge of the woods; and in the open field back of the sawmill the Prussian soldiers were drilling. It was all much more tempting than the rule for participles, but I had the strength to resist, and hurried off to school.  When I passed the town hall there was a crowd in front of the bulletin-board. For the last two years all our bad news had come from there \u2014 the lost battles, the draft, the orders of the commanding officer \u2014 and I thought to myself, without stopping, \u201cWhat can be the matter now?\u201d  Then, as I hurried by as fast as I could go, the blacksmith, Wachter, who was there, with his apprentice, reading the bulletin, called after me, \u201cDon\u2019t go so fast, bub; you\u2019ll get to your school in plenty of time!\u201d  I thought he was making fun of me, and reached M. Hamel\u2019s little garden all out of breath.  Usually, when school began, there was a great bustle, which could be heard out in the street, the opening and closing of desks, lessons repeated in unison, very loud, with our hands over our ears to understand better, and the teacher\u2019s great ruler rapping on the table. But now it was all so still! I had counted on the commotion to get to my desk without being seen; but, of course, that day everything had to be as quiet as Sunday morning. Through the window I saw my classmates, already in their places, and M. Hamel walking up and down with his terrible iron ruler under his arm. I had to open the door and go in before everybody. You can imagine how I blushed and how frightened I was.  But nothing happened. M. Hamel saw me and said very kindly, \u201cGo to your place quickly, little Franz. We were beginning without you.\u201d I jumped over the bench and sat down at my desk.  - The Last Lesson- Alphonse Daudet",

Hamel had said that he would question us on participles, and I did not know the first word about them. For a moment I thought of running away and spending the day out of doors. It was so warm, so bright! The birds were chirping at the edge of the woods; and in the open field back of the sawmill the Prussian soldiers were drilling. It was all much more tempting than the rule for participles, but I had the strength to resist, and hurried off to school.  When I passed the town hall there was a crowd in front of the bulletin-board. For the last two years all our bad news had come from there \u2014 the lost battles, the draft, the orders of the commanding officer \u2014 and I thought to myself, without stopping, \u201cWhat can be the matter now?\u201d  Then, as I hurried by as fast as I could go, the blacksmith, Wachter, who was there, with his apprentice, reading the bulletin, called after me, \u201cDon\u2019t go so fast, bub; you\u2019ll get to your school in plenty of time!\u201d  I thought he was making fun of me, and reached M. Hamel\u2019s little garden all out of breath.  Usually, when school began, there was a great bustle, which could be heard out in the street, the opening and closing of desks, lessons repeated in unison, very loud, with our hands over our ears to understand better, and the teacher\u2019s great ruler rapping on the table. But now it was all so still! I had counted on the commotion to get to my desk without being seen; but, of course, that day everything had to be as quiet as Sunday morning. Through the window I saw my classmates, already in their places, and M. Hamel walking up and down with his terrible iron ruler under his arm. I had to open the door and go in before everybody. You can imagine how I blushed and how frightened I was.  But nothing happened. M. Hamel saw me and said very kindly, \u201cGo to your place quickly, little Franz. We were beginning without you.\u201d I jumped over the bench and sat down at my desk.  - The Last Lesson- Alphonse Daudet",
