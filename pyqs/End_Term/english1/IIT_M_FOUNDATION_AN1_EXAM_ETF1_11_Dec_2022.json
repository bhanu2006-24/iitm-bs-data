From this height one could see the river and the field of ripe corn dotted with the flowers that always promised a good harvest. The only thing the earth needed was a downpour or at least a shower. Throughout the morning Lencho \u2014 who knew his fields intimately \u2014 had done nothing else but see the sky towards the north-east.  \u201cNow we\u2019re really going to get some water, woman.\u201d  The woman who was preparing supper, replied, \u201cYes, God willing\u201d. The older boys were working in the field, while the smaller ones were playing near the house until the woman called to them all, \u201cCome for dinner\u201d. It was during the meal that, just as Lencho had predicted, big drops of rain began to fall. In the north-east huge mountains of clouds could be seen approaching. The air was fresh and sweet. The man went out for no other reason than to have the pleasure of feeling the rain on his body, and when he returned he exclaimed, \u2018\u2018These aren\u2019t raindrops falling from the sky, they are new coins. The big drops are ten cent pieces and the little ones are fives.\u2019\u2019  With a satisfied expression he regarded the field of ripe corn with its flowers, draped in a curtain of rain. But suddenly a strong wind began to blow and along with the rain very large hailstones began to fall. These truly did resemble new silver coins. The boys, exposing themselves to the rain, ran out to collect the frozen pearls.  \u2018\u2018It\u2019s really getting bad now,\u2019\u2019 exclaimed the man. \u201cI hope it passes quickly.\u201d It did not pass quickly. For an hour the hail rained on the house, the garden, the hillside, the cornfield, on the whole valley. The field was white, as if covered with salt.  Not a leaf remained on the trees. The corn was totally destroyed. The flowers were gone from the plants. Lencho\u2019s soul was filled with sadness. When the storm had passed, he stood in the middle of the field and said to his sons, \u201cA plague of locusts would have left more than this. The hail has left nothing. This year we will have no corn.\u2019\u2019  That night was a sorrowful one. \u201cAll our work, for nothing.\u201d \u2018\u2018There\u2019s no one who can help us.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ll all go hungry this year.\u201d  But in the hearts of all who lived in that solitary house in the middle of the valley, there was a single hope: help from God.  \u201cDon\u2019t be so upset, even though this seems like a total loss. Remember, no one dies of hunger.\u201d  \u201cThat\u2019s what they say: no one dies of hunger.\u201d  All through the night, Lencho thought only of his one hope: the help of God, whose eyes, as he had been instructed, see everything, even what is deep in one\u2019s conscience. Lencho was an ox of a man, working like an animal in the fields, but still he knew how to write. The following Sunday, at daybreak, he began to write a letter which he himself would carry to town and place in the mail. It was nothing less than a letter to God.",

From this height one could see the river and the field of ripe corn dotted with the flowers that always promised a good harvest. The only thing the earth needed was a downpour or at least a shower. Throughout the morning Lencho \u2014 who knew his fields intimately \u2014 had done nothing else but see the sky towards the north-east.  \u201cNow we\u2019re really going to get some water, woman.\u201d  The woman who was preparing supper, replied, \u201cYes, God willing\u201d. The older boys were working in the field, while the smaller ones were playing near the house until the woman called to them all, \u201cCome for dinner\u201d. It was during the meal that, just as Lencho had predicted, big drops of rain began to fall. In the north-east huge mountains of clouds could be seen approaching. The air was fresh and sweet. The man went out for no other reason than to have the pleasure of feeling the rain on his body, and when he returned he exclaimed, \u2018\u2018These aren\u2019t raindrops falling from the sky, they are new coins. The big drops are ten cent pieces and the little ones are fives.\u2019\u2019  With a satisfied expression he regarded the field of ripe corn with its flowers, draped in a curtain of rain. But suddenly a strong wind began to blow and along with the rain very large hailstones began to fall. These truly did resemble new silver coins. The boys, exposing themselves to the rain, ran out to collect the frozen pearls.  \u2018\u2018It\u2019s really getting bad now,\u2019\u2019 exclaimed the man. \u201cI hope it passes quickly.\u201d It did not pass quickly. For an hour the hail rained on the house, the garden, the hillside, the cornfield, on the whole valley. The field was white, as if covered with salt.  Not a leaf remained on the trees. The corn was totally destroyed. The flowers were gone from the plants. Lencho\u2019s soul was filled with sadness. When the storm had passed, he stood in the middle of the field and said to his sons, \u201cA plague of locusts would have left more than this. The hail has left nothing. This year we will have no corn.\u2019\u2019  That night was a sorrowful one. \u201cAll our work, for nothing.\u201d \u2018\u2018There\u2019s no one who can help us.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ll all go hungry this year.\u201d  But in the hearts of all who lived in that solitary house in the middle of the valley, there was a single hope: help from God.  \u201cDon\u2019t be so upset, even though this seems like a total loss. Remember, no one dies of hunger.\u201d  \u201cThat\u2019s what they say: no one dies of hunger.\u201d  All through the night, Lencho thought only of his one hope: the help of God, whose eyes, as he had been instructed, see everything, even what is deep in one\u2019s conscience. Lencho was an ox of a man, working like an animal in the fields, but still he knew how to write. The following Sunday, at daybreak, he began to write a letter which he himself would carry to town and place in the mail. It was nothing less than a letter to God.",

                            "Read the following passage and answer the given subquestions :  THE house \u2014 the only one in the entire valley \u2014 sat on the crest of a low hill. From this height one could see the river and the field of ripe corn dotted with the flowers that always promised a good harvest. The only thing the earth needed was a downpour or at least a shower. Throughout the morning Lencho \u2014 who knew his fields intimately \u2014 had done nothing else but see the sky towards the north-east.  \u201cNow we\u2019re really going to get some water, woman.\u201d  The woman who was preparing supper, replied, \u201cYes, God willing\u201d. The older boys were working in the field, while the smaller ones were playing near the house until the woman called to them all, \u201cCome for dinner\u201d. It was during the meal that, just as Lencho had predicted, big drops of rain began to fall. In the north-east huge mountains of clouds could be seen approaching. The air was fresh and sweet. The man went out for no other reason than to have the pleasure of feeling the rain on his body, and when he returned he exclaimed, \u2018\u2018These aren\u2019t raindrops falling from the sky, they are new coins. The big drops are ten cent pieces and the little ones are fives.\u2019\u2019  With a satisfied expression he regarded the field of ripe corn with its flowers, draped in a curtain of rain. But suddenly a strong wind began to blow and along with the rain very large hailstones began to fall. These truly did resemble new silver coins. The boys, exposing themselves to the rain, ran out to collect the frozen pearls.  \u2018\u2018It\u2019s really getting bad now,\u2019\u2019 exclaimed the man. \u201cI hope it passes quickly.\u201d It did not pass quickly. For an hour the hail rained on the house, the garden, the hillside, the cornfield, on the whole valley. The field was white, as if covered with salt.  Not a leaf remained on the trees. The corn was totally destroyed. The flowers were gone from the plants. Lencho\u2019s soul was filled with sadness. When the storm had passed, he stood in the middle of the field and said to his sons, \u201cA plague of locusts would have left more than this. The hail has left nothing. This year we will have no corn.\u2019\u2019  That night was a sorrowful one. \u201cAll our work, for nothing.\u201d \u2018\u2018There\u2019s no one who can help us.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ll all go hungry this year.\u201d  But in the hearts of all who lived in that solitary house in the middle of the valley, there was a single hope: help from God.  \u201cDon\u2019t be so upset, even though this seems like a total loss. Remember, no one dies of hunger.\u201d  \u201cThat\u2019s what they say: no one dies of hunger.\u201d  All through the night, Lencho thought only of his one hope: the help of God, whose eyes, as he had been instructed, see everything, even what is deep in one\u2019s conscience. Lencho was an ox of a man, working like an animal in the fields, but still he knew how to write. The following Sunday, at daybreak, he began to write a letter which he himself would carry to town and place in the mail. It was nothing less than a letter to God."

Throughout the morning Lencho \u2014 who knew his fields intimately \u2014 had done nothing else but see the sky towards the north-east.  \u201cNow we\u2019re really going to get some water, woman.\u201d  The woman who was preparing supper, replied, \u201cYes, God willing\u201d. The older boys were working in the field, while the smaller ones were playing near the house until the woman called to them all, \u201cCome for dinner\u201d. It was during the meal that, just as Lencho had predicted, big drops of rain began to fall. In the north-east huge mountains of clouds could be seen approaching. The air was fresh and sweet. The man went out for no other reason than to have the pleasure of feeling the rain on his body, and when he returned he exclaimed, \u2018\u2018These aren\u2019t raindrops falling from the sky, they are new coins. The big drops are ten cent pieces and the little ones are fives.\u2019\u2019  With a satisfied expression he regarded the field of ripe corn with its flowers, draped in a curtain of rain. But suddenly a strong wind began to blow and along with the rain very large hailstones began to fall. These truly did resemble new silver coins. The boys, exposing themselves to the rain, ran out to collect the frozen pearls.  \u2018\u2018It\u2019s really getting bad now,\u2019\u2019 exclaimed the man. \u201cI hope it passes quickly.\u201d It did not pass quickly. For an hour the hail rained on the house, the garden, the hillside, the cornfield, on the whole valley. The field was white, as if covered with salt.  Not a leaf remained on the trees. The corn was totally destroyed. The flowers were gone from the plants. Lencho\u2019s soul was filled with sadness. When the storm had passed, he stood in the middle of the field and said to his sons, \u201cA plague of locusts would have left more than this. The hail has left nothing. This year we will have no corn.\u2019\u2019  That night was a sorrowful one. \u201cAll our work, for nothing.\u201d \u2018\u2018There\u2019s no one who can help us.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ll all go hungry this year.\u201d  But in the hearts of all who lived in that solitary house in the middle of the valley, there was a single hope: help from God.  \u201cDon\u2019t be so upset, even though this seems like a total loss. Remember, no one dies of hunger.\u201d  \u201cThat\u2019s what they say: no one dies of hunger.\u201d  All through the night, Lencho thought only of his one hope: the help of God, whose eyes, as he had been instructed, see everything, even what is deep in one\u2019s conscience. Lencho was an ox of a man, working like an animal in the fields, but still he knew how to write. The following Sunday, at daybreak, he began to write a letter which he himself would carry to town and place in the mail. It was nothing less than a letter to God."

From this height one could see the river and the field of ripe corn dotted with the flowers that always promised a good harvest. The only thing the earth needed was a downpour or at least a shower. Throughout the morning Lencho \u2014 who knew his fields intimately \u2014 had done nothing else but see the sky towards the north-east.  \u201cNow we\u2019re really going to get some water, woman.\u201d  The woman who was preparing supper, replied, \u201cYes, God willing\u201d. The older boys were working in the field, while the smaller ones were playing near the house until the woman called to them all, \u201cCome for dinner\u201d. It was during the meal that, just as Lencho had predicted, big drops of rain began to fall. In the north-east huge mountains of clouds could be seen approaching. The air was fresh and sweet. The man went out for no other reason than to have the pleasure of feeling the rain on his body, and when he returned he exclaimed, \u2018\u2018These aren\u2019t raindrops falling from the sky, they are new coins. The big drops are ten cent pieces and the little ones are fives.\u2019\u2019  With a satisfied expression he regarded the field of ripe corn with its flowers, draped in a curtain of rain. But suddenly a strong wind began to blow and along with the rain very large hailstones began to fall. These truly did resemble new silver coins. The boys, exposing themselves to the rain, ran out to collect the frozen pearls.  \u2018\u2018It\u2019s really getting bad now,\u2019\u2019 exclaimed the man. \u201cI hope it passes quickly.\u201d It did not pass quickly. For an hour the hail rained on the house, the garden, the hillside, the cornfield, on the whole valley. The field was white, as if covered with salt.  Not a leaf remained on the trees. The corn was totally destroyed. The flowers were gone from the plants. Lencho\u2019s soul was filled with sadness. When the storm had passed, he stood in the middle of the field and said to his sons, \u201cA plague of locusts would have left more than this. The hail has left nothing. This year we will have no corn.\u2019\u2019  That night was a sorrowful one. \u201cAll our work, for nothing.\u201d \u2018\u2018There\u2019s no one who can help us.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ll all go hungry this year.\u201d  But in the hearts of all who lived in that solitary house in the middle of the valley, there was a single hope: help from God.  \u201cDon\u2019t be so upset, even though this seems like a total loss. Remember, no one dies of hunger.\u201d  \u201cThat\u2019s what they say: no one dies of hunger.\u201d  All through the night, Lencho thought only of his one hope: the help of God, whose eyes, as he had been instructed, see everything, even what is deep in one\u2019s conscience. Lencho was an ox of a man, working like an animal in the fields, but still he knew how to write. The following Sunday, at daybreak, he began to write a letter which he himself would carry to town and place in the mail. It was nothing less than a letter to God.",

For an hour the hail rained on the house, the garden, the hillside, the cornfield, on the whole valley. The field was white, as if covered with salt.  Not a leaf remained on the trees. The corn was totally destroyed. The flowers were gone from the plants. Lencho\u2019s soul was filled with sadness.

Remember, no one dies of hunger.\u201d  \u201cThat\u2019s what they say: no one dies of hunger.\u201d  All through the night, Lencho thought only of his one hope: the help of God, whose eyes, as he had been instructed, see everything, even what is deep in one\u2019s conscience.

The boys, exposing themselves to the rain, ran out to collect the frozen pearls.  \u2018\u2018It\u2019s really getting bad now,\u2019\u2019 exclaimed the man. \u201cI hope it passes quickly.\u201d It did not pass quickly. For an hour the hail rained on the house, the garden, the hillside, the cornfield, on the whole valley. The field was white, as if covered with salt.  Not a leaf remained on the trees. The corn was totally destroyed. The flowers were gone from the plants. Lencho\u2019s soul was filled with sadness. When the storm had passed, he stood in the middle of the field and said to his sons, \u201cA plague of locusts would have left more than this. The hail has left nothing. This year we will have no corn.\u2019\u2019  That night was a sorrowful one. \u201cAll our work, for nothing.\u201d \u2018\u2018There\u2019s no one who can help us.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ll all go hungry this year.\u201d  But in the hearts of all who lived in that solitary house in the middle of the valley, there was a single hope: help from God.  \u201cDon\u2019t be so upset, even though this seems like a total loss. Remember, no one dies of hunger.\u201d  \u201cThat\u2019s what they say: no one dies of hunger.\u201d  All through the night, Lencho thought only of his one hope: the help of God, whose eyes, as he had been instructed, see everything, even what is deep in one\u2019s conscience. Lencho was an ox of a man, working like an animal in the fields, but still he knew how to write. The following Sunday, at daybreak, he began to write a letter which he himself would carry to town and place in the mail. It was nothing less than a letter to God."
