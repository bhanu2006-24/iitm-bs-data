We felt angry; the proper first stage, he said, is denial. In late August this year, my 38-year-old son, Michael, died suddenly in his sleep, leaving behind a 2-year-old son and a wife expecting their next child. There is no set form for grief, and no \u2018right\u2019 way to express it. There seems to be an expectation that, after a great loss, we will progress systematically through the well-known stages of grief. It is wrong, we are told, to jump to anger \u2014 or to wallow too long in this stage before moving towards acceptance. But I was, and am, angry. To make parents bury their children is wrong; to have both my wife and son taken from me, for forever and a day, is cruel beyond words. A relative from Jerusalem, who is a psychiatrist, brought some solace by citing the maxim: \u2018We are not to ask why, but what.\u2019 The \u2018what\u2019 is that which survivors in grief are bound to do for one another. Following that advice, my family, close friends and I keep busy, calling each other and giving long answers to simple questions like, \u201cHow did your day go today?\u201d We try to avoid thinking about either the immediate past or the bereft future. We take turns playing with Max, Michael\u2019s two-year-old son. Friends spend nights with the young widow, and will be among those holding her hand when the baby is born.

We felt angry; the proper first stage, he said, is denial. In late August this year, my 38-year-old son, Michael, died suddenly in his sleep, leaving behind a 2-year-old son and a wife expecting their next child. There is no set form for grief, and no \u2018right\u2019 way to express it. There seems to be an expectation that, after a great loss, we will progress systematically through the well-known stages of grief. It is wrong, we are told, to jump to anger \u2014 or to wallow too long in this stage before moving towards acceptance. But I was, and am, angry. To make parents bury their children is wrong; to have both my wife and son taken from me, for forever and a day, is cruel beyond words. A relative from Jerusalem, who is a psychiatrist, brought some solace by citing the maxim: \u2018We are not to ask why, but what.\u2019 The \u2018what\u2019 is that which survivors in grief are bound to do for one another. Following that advice, my family, close friends and I keep busy, calling each other and giving long answers to simple questions like, \u201cHow did your day go today?\u201d We try to avoid thinking about either the immediate past or the bereft future. We take turns playing with Max, Michael\u2019s two-year-old son. Friends spend nights with the young widow, and will be among those holding her hand when the baby is born.

There is no set form for grief, and no \u2018right\u2019 way to express it. There seems to be an expectation that, after a great loss, we will progress systematically through the well-known stages of grief. It is wrong, we are told, to jump to anger \u2014 or to wallow too long in this stage before moving towards acceptance. But I was, and am, angry. To make parents bury their children is wrong; to have both my wife and son taken from me, for forever and a day, is cruel beyond words. A relative from Jerusalem, who is a psychiatrist, brought some solace by citing the maxim: \u2018We are not to ask why, but what.\u2019 The \u2018what\u2019 is that which survivors in grief are bound to do for one another. Following that advice, my family, close friends and I keep busy, calling each other and giving long answers to simple questions like, \u201cHow did your day go today?\u201d We try to avoid thinking about either the immediate past or the bereft future.

We felt angry; the proper first stage, he said, is denial. In late August this year, my 38-year-old son, Michael, died suddenly in his sleep, leaving behind a 2-year-old son and a wife expecting their next child. There is no set form for grief, and no \u2018right\u2019 way to express it. There seems to be an expectation that, after a great loss, we will progress systematically through the well-known stages of grief. It is wrong, we are told, to jump to anger \u2014 or to wallow too long in this stage before moving towards acceptance. But I was, and am, angry. To make parents bury their children is wrong; to have both my wife and son taken from me, for forever and a day, is cruel beyond words. A relative from Jerusalem, who is a psychiatrist, brought some solace by citing the maxim: \u2018We are not to ask why, but what.\u2019 The \u2018what\u2019 is that which survivors in grief are bound to do for one another. Following that advice, my family, close friends and I keep busy, calling each other and giving long answers to simple questions like, \u201cHow did your day go today?\u201d We try to avoid thinking about either the immediate past or the bereft future. We take turns playing with Max, Michael\u2019s two-year-old son. Friends spend nights with the young widow, and will be among those holding her hand when the baby is born.

In late August this year, my 38-year-old son, Michael, died suddenly in his sleep, leaving behind a 2-year-old son and a wife expecting their next child. There is no set form for grief, and no \u2018right\u2019 way to express it. There seems to be an expectation that, after a great loss, we will progress systematically through the well-known stages of grief. It is wrong, we are told, to jump to anger \u2014 or to wallow too long in this stage before moving towards acceptance. But I was, and am, angry. To make parents bury their children is wrong; to have both my wife and son taken from me, for forever and a day, is cruel beyond words. A relative from Jerusalem, who is a psychiatrist, brought some solace by citing the maxim: \u2018We are not to ask why, but what.\u2019 The \u2018what\u2019 is that which survivors in grief are bound to do for one another. Following that advice, my family, close friends and I keep busy, calling each other and giving long answers to simple questions like, \u201cHow did your day go today?\u201d We try to avoid thinking about either the immediate past or the bereft future. We take turns playing with Max, Michael\u2019s two-year-old son. Friends spend nights with the young widow, and will be among those holding her hand when the baby is born.

We felt angry; the proper first stage, he said, is denial. In late August this year, my 38-year-old son, Michael, died suddenly in his sleep, leaving behind a 2-year-old son and a wife expecting their next child. There is no set form for grief, and no \u2018right\u2019 way to express it. There seems to be an expectation that, after a great loss, we will progress systematically through the well-known stages of grief. It is wrong, we are told, to jump to anger \u2014 or to wallow too long in this stage before moving towards acceptance. But I was, and am, angry. To make parents bury their children is wrong; to have both my wife and son taken from me, for forever and a day, is cruel beyond words. A relative from Jerusalem, who is a psychiatrist, brought some solace by citing the maxim: \u2018We are not to ask why, but what.\u2019 The \u2018what\u2019 is that which survivors in grief are bound to do for one another. Following that advice, my family, close friends and I keep busy, calling each other and giving long answers to simple questions like, \u201cHow did your day go today?\u201d We try to avoid thinking about either the immediate past or the bereft future. We take turns playing with Max, Michael\u2019s two-year-old son. Friends spend nights with the young widow, and will be among those holding her hand when the baby is born.

What if you lived in an apartment that did not have its own kitchen or bathroom?  A New York think tank called the 5Boro Institute says such apartments could put a dent in two crises the city is facing \u2014 the chronic shortage of housing and the surplus of office space in Manhattan. 5Boro maintains that empty office space could be turned into housing for \u201cflexible co-living,\u201d with communal kitchens and bathrooms.  5Boro argues in a new report that such conversions would cost less and could be completed faster than conventional office-to-residential conversions. 5Boro says there is just over 100 million square feet of available office space in Manhattan. That figure could grow as long-term leases go unrenewed \u2014 or as commercial tenants take less space, because remote work means fewer employees are going into the office. 5Boro\u2019s report says that flexible co-living, a twist on co-living, or \u201cdorms for adults,\u201d could turn the empty space into apartments and surmount the architectural and regulatory problems that often stymie office-to-residential [Edit i] project. The group is calling for the city to set up a pilot conversion.  \u201cGiven the state of the housing crisis and the fact that New York is tied for first place in a global ranking of the most expensive cities in the world, we need to be trying new ideas,\u201d said Grace Rauh, the executive director of 5Boro and an author of a new report about [Edit ii] office-to-resident conversions. \u201c[Edit iii] We think not only is this doable, but we think this is a way to maximize the amount of housing that can be created through office-to-residential conversions and to minimize the costs, so rents for tenants can be much more affordable.\u201d  Adapted from: Barron, James. \u201cWill New Yorkers Move Into Homes With Shared Kitchens and Baths?.\u201d New York Today, 05 Oct, 2023, The New York Times,",

        "summary": "Here\u2019s a structured **summary of core topics, concepts, and principles** for the **\"Foundation Level: Semester I: English I (Computer-Based Exam)\"** based on the question paper, along with a **Mermaid knowledge graph** to visualize relationships.\n\n---\n\n### **Core Topics & Concepts**\n#### **1. Reading Comprehension**\n   - **Key Skills**:\n     - Identifying main ideas, supporting details, and tone (formal/informal).\n     - Inferring meaning from context (e.g., \"solace,\" \"maxim,\" \"bereft\").\n     - Recognizing literary devices (e.g., repetition, cause-effect relationships).\n     - Distinguishing fact vs. opinion.\n   - **Passage Types**:\n     - Narrative (e.g., grief, personal loss).\n     - Persuasive/Argumentative (e.g., housing crisis solutions).\n     - Dialogue-based (e.g., telephone conversations).\n   - **Common Questions**:\n     - Vocabulary in context (antonyms/synonyms).\n     - True/False statements.\n     - Fill-in-the-blank (grammar/vocabulary).\n     - Tone and audience analysis.\n\n#### **2. Grammar**\n   - **Verb Tenses**:\n     - Past simple (e.g., \"died,\" \"sowed\").\n     - Past continuous (e.g., \"was hopping,\" \"was sowing\").\n     - Future simple (e.g., \"will repent\").\n     - Present perfect (e.g., \"has been despising\").\n   - **Articles**:\n     - Definite (\"the\") vs. indefinite (\"a\"/\"an\").\n   - **Prepositions**:\n     - Time (\"at 5:00 o\u2019clock\"), place (\"in/on the table\").\n   - **Subject-Verb Agreement**:\n     - Singular/plural consistency (e.g., \"birds were hopping\").\n   - **Modals**:\n     - Polite requests (\"May I speak to Kavya?\").\n     - Hypotheticals (\"I wish I were a child\").\n   - **Active/Passive Voice**:\n     - Recognizing correct forms (e.g., \"the hemp was made into cord\").\n\n   - **Common Errors**:\n     - Double comparatives (e.g., \"more hotter\" \u2192 \"hotter\").\n     - Misplaced modifiers (e.g., \"behaves friendly\" \u2192 \"behaves in a friendly manner\").\n\n#### **3. Vocabulary**\n   - **Antonyms/Synonyms**:\n     - Match words to opposites (e.g., \"attend\" \u2194 \"desert,\" \"blight\" \u2194 \"enhance\").\n     - Contextual clues (e.g., \"wallow\" = \"to stay in a state without change\").\n   - **Idioms/Expressions**:\n     - \"Sell someone out\" (betray), \"get ahead\" (succeed).\n   - **Word Stress & Syllables**:\n     - Counting syllables (e.g., \"dissimilarity\" = 6).\n     - Stress patterns (e.g., \"po-**pu**-lar-i-ty\").\n\n#### **4. Writing & Editing**\n   - **Sentence Correction**:\n     - Grammar (e.g., \"It is I who **am** the culprit\").\n     - Word choice (e.g., \"office-to-**residential**\" vs. \"office-to-resident\").\n   - **Punctuation**:\n     - Commas, hyphens, quotation marks.\n   - **Paragraph Unity**:\n     - Topic sentences (e.g., questions as hooks).\n     - Repetition of key terms (e.g., \"housing crisis,\" \"conversions\").\n\n#### **5. Literary Devices**\n   - **Maxims/Proverbs**:\n     - Interpretation (e.g., \"We are not to ask why, but what\").\n   - **Irony**:\n     - Situational (e.g., \"dorms for adults\" for housing solutions).\n   - **Tone & Mood**:\n     - Formal (e.g., news articles) vs. informal (e.g., dialogues).\n\n#### **6. Phonetics**\n   - **Sounds & Pronunciation**:\n     - Identifying \"y\" sounds (e.g., \"yoke\").\n     - Plural markers (e.g., \"lemons\" = [z]).\n   - **Odd One Out**:\n     - Phonetic similarity (e.g., \"thief,\" \"thought,\" \"think\" vs. \"these\").\n\n---\n\n### **Key Equations/Formulas (N/A for English)**\nNo mathematical equations are relevant here. Instead, focus on:\n- **Grammar rules** (e.g., tense consistency, subject-verb agreement).\n- **Vocabulary patterns** (e.g., antonyms, synonyms, idioms).\n\n---\n\n### **Mermaid Knowledge Graphs**\n#### **1.
