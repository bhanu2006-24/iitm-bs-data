The artificial intelligence model triggered such alarm with some OpenAI researchers that they wrote to the board of directors before Altman\u2019s dismissal warning that it could threaten humanity, Reuters reported.  The model, called Q* \u2013 and pronounced as \u201cQ Star\u201d \u2013 was able to solve basic maths problems it had not seen before, according to the tech news site The Information, which added that the pace of development behind the system had alarmed some safety researchers. The ability to solve maths problems would be viewed as a significant development in AI. The reports followed days of turmoil at San Francisco-based Open AI, whose board sacked Altman, but then reinstated him after nearly all of the company\u2019s 750 staff threatened to resign if he were not brought back. Altman also had the support of OpenAI\u2019s biggest investor, Microsoft.   Many experts are concerned that companies such as OpenAI are moving too fast towards developing artificial general intelligence (AGI), the term for a system that can perform tasks at human or above-human levels of intelligence \u2013 and which could, in theory, evade human control. Andrew Rogoyski, of the Institute for People-Centred AI at the University of Surrey, said the existence of a maths-solving large language model (LLM) would be a breakthrough. He said: \u201cThe intrinsic ability of LLMs to do maths is a major step forward, allowing AIs to offer a whole new swath of analytical capabilities. It\u2019s a big step forward.\u201d   In an appearance at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, Altman said: \u201cFour times now in the history of OpenAI, the most recent time was just in the last couple weeks [sic], I\u2019ve gotten to be in the room, when we sort of push the veil of ignorance back and the frontier of discovery forward, and getting to do that is the professional honour of a lifetime.\u201d Open AI was founded as a nonprofit venture with a board that governs a commercial subsidiary, run by Altman. Open AI states that it was established with the goal of developing \u201csafe and beneficial artificial general intelligence for the benefit of humanity\u201d and that the for-profit company would be \u201clegally bound to pursue the nonprofit\u2019s mission.\u201d The emphasis on safety led to the speculation that Altman had been sacked for endangering the company\u2019s core mission.

The artificial intelligence model triggered such alarm with some OpenAI researchers that they wrote to the board of directors before Altman\u2019s dismissal warning that it could threaten humanity, Reuters reported.  The model, called Q* \u2013 and pronounced as \u201cQ Star\u201d \u2013 was able to solve basic maths problems it had not seen before, according to the tech news site The Information, which added that the pace of development behind the system had alarmed some safety researchers. The ability to solve maths problems would be viewed as a significant development in AI. The reports followed days of turmoil at San Francisco-based Open AI, whose board sacked Altman, but then reinstated him after nearly all of the company\u2019s 750 staff threatened to resign if he were not brought back. Altman also had the support of OpenAI\u2019s biggest investor, Microsoft.   Many experts are concerned that companies such as OpenAI are moving too fast towards developing artificial general intelligence (AGI), the term for a system that can perform tasks at human or above-human levels of intelligence \u2013 and which could, in theory, evade human control. Andrew Rogoyski, of the Institute for People-Centred AI at the University of Surrey, said the existence of a maths-solving large language model (LLM) would be a breakthrough. He said: \u201cThe intrinsic ability of LLMs to do maths is a major step forward, allowing AIs to offer a whole new swath of analytical capabilities. It\u2019s a big step forward.\u201d   In an appearance at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, Altman said: \u201cFour times now in the history of OpenAI, the most recent time was just in the last couple weeks [sic], I\u2019ve gotten to be in the room, when we sort of push the veil of ignorance back and the frontier of discovery forward, and getting to do that is the professional honour of a lifetime.\u201d Open AI was founded as a nonprofit venture with a board that governs a commercial subsidiary, run by Altman. Open AI states that it was established with the goal of developing \u201csafe and beneficial artificial general intelligence for the benefit of humanity\u201d and that the for-profit company would be \u201clegally bound to pursue the nonprofit\u2019s mission.\u201d The emphasis on safety led to the speculation that Altman had been sacked for endangering the company\u2019s core mission.

The model, called Q* \u2013 and pronounced as \u201cQ Star\u201d \u2013 was able to solve basic maths problems it had not seen before, according to the tech news site The Information, which added that the pace of development behind the system had alarmed some safety researchers. The ability to solve maths problems would be viewed as a significant development in AI. The reports followed days of turmoil at San Francisco-based Open AI, whose board sacked Altman, but then reinstated him after nearly all of the company\u2019s 750 staff threatened to resign if he were not brought back. Altman also had the support of OpenAI\u2019s biggest investor, Microsoft.   Many experts are concerned that companies such as OpenAI are moving too fast towards developing artificial general intelligence (AGI), the term for a system that can perform tasks at human or above-human levels of intelligence \u2013 and which could, in theory, evade human control. Andrew Rogoyski, of the Institute for People-Centred AI at the University of Surrey, said the existence of a maths-solving large language model (LLM) would be a breakthrough. He said: \u201cThe intrinsic ability of LLMs to do maths is a major step forward, allowing AIs to offer a whole new swath of analytical capabilities. It\u2019s a big step forward.\u201d   In an appearance at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, Altman said: \u201cFour times now in the history of OpenAI, the most recent time was just in the last couple weeks [sic], I\u2019ve gotten to be in the room, when we sort of push the veil of ignorance back and the frontier of discovery forward, and getting to do that is the professional honour of a lifetime.\u201d Open AI was founded as a nonprofit venture with a board that governs a commercial subsidiary, run by Altman. Open AI states that it was established with the goal of developing \u201csafe and beneficial artificial general intelligence for the benefit of humanity\u201d and that the for-profit company would be \u201clegally bound to pursue the nonprofit\u2019s mission.\u201d The emphasis on safety led to the speculation that Altman had been sacked for endangering the company\u2019s core mission.

The artificial intelligence model triggered such alarm with some OpenAI researchers that they wrote to the board of directors before Altman\u2019s dismissal warning that it could threaten humanity, Reuters reported.  The model, called Q* \u2013 and pronounced as \u201cQ Star\u201d \u2013 was able to solve basic maths problems it had not seen before, according to the tech news site The Information, which added that the pace of development behind the system had alarmed some safety researchers. The ability to solve maths problems would be viewed as a significant development in AI. The reports followed days of turmoil at San Francisco-based Open AI, whose board sacked Altman, but then reinstated him after nearly all of the company\u2019s 750 staff threatened to resign if he were not brought back. Altman also had the support of OpenAI\u2019s biggest investor, Microsoft.   Many experts are concerned that companies such as OpenAI are moving too fast towards developing artificial general intelligence (AGI), the term for a system that can perform tasks at human or above-human levels of intelligence \u2013 and which could, in theory, evade human control. Andrew Rogoyski, of the Institute for People-Centred AI at the University of Surrey, said the existence of a maths-solving large language model (LLM) would be a breakthrough. He said: \u201cThe intrinsic ability of LLMs to do maths is a major step forward, allowing AIs to offer a whole new swath of analytical capabilities. It\u2019s a big step forward.\u201d   In an appearance at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, Altman said: \u201cFour times now in the history of OpenAI, the most recent time was just in the last couple weeks [sic], I\u2019ve gotten to be in the room, when we sort of push the veil of ignorance back and the frontier of discovery forward, and getting to do that is the professional honour of a lifetime.\u201d Open AI was founded as a nonprofit venture with a board that governs a commercial subsidiary, run by Altman. Open AI states that it was established with the goal of developing \u201csafe and beneficial artificial general intelligence for the benefit of humanity\u201d and that the for-profit company would be \u201clegally bound to pursue the nonprofit\u2019s mission.\u201d The emphasis on safety led to the speculation that Altman had been sacked for endangering the company\u2019s core mission.

The artificial intelligence model triggered such alarm with some OpenAI researchers that they wrote to the board of directors before Altman\u2019s dismissal warning that it could threaten humanity, Reuters reported.  The model, called Q* \u2013 and pronounced as \u201cQ Star\u201d \u2013 was able to solve basic maths problems it had not seen before, according to the tech news site The Information, which added that the pace of development behind the system had alarmed some safety researchers. The ability to solve maths problems would be viewed as a significant development in AI. The reports followed days of turmoil at San Francisco-based Open AI, whose board sacked Altman, but then reinstated him after nearly all of the company\u2019s 750 staff threatened to resign if he were not brought back. Altman also had the support of OpenAI\u2019s biggest investor, Microsoft.   Many experts are concerned that companies such as OpenAI are moving too fast towards developing artificial general intelligence (AGI), the term for a system that can perform tasks at human or above-human levels of intelligence \u2013 and which could, in theory, evade human control. Andrew Rogoyski, of the Institute for People-Centred AI at the University of Surrey, said the existence of a maths-solving large language model (LLM) would be a breakthrough. He said: \u201cThe intrinsic ability of LLMs to do maths is a major step forward, allowing AIs to offer a whole new swath of analytical capabilities. It\u2019s a big step forward.\u201d   In an appearance at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, Altman said: \u201cFour times now in the history of OpenAI, the most recent time was just in the last couple weeks [sic], I\u2019ve gotten to be in the room, when we sort of push the veil of ignorance back and the frontier of discovery forward, and getting to do that is the professional honour of a lifetime.\u201d Open AI was founded as a nonprofit venture with a board that governs a commercial subsidiary, run by Altman. Open AI states that it was established with the goal of developing \u201csafe and beneficial artificial general intelligence for the benefit of humanity\u201d and that the for-profit company would be \u201clegally bound to pursue the nonprofit\u2019s mission.\u201d The emphasis on safety led to the speculation that Altman had been sacked for endangering the company\u2019s core mission.

                            "Read the following passage and answer the given subquestions:  Open AI Staff \u2018Warned Board New System Threatened Humanity\u2019  Open AI was reportedly working on an advanced system that was so powerful that it caused safety concerns among staff at the company before Sam Altman\u2019s sacking. The artificial intelligence model triggered such alarm with some OpenAI researchers that they wrote to the board of directors before Altman\u2019s dismissal warning that it could threaten humanity, Reuters reported.  The model, called Q* \u2013 and pronounced as \u201cQ Star\u201d \u2013 was able to solve basic maths problems it had not seen before, according to the tech news site The Information, which added that the pace of development behind the system had alarmed some safety researchers. The ability to solve maths problems would be viewed as a significant development in AI. The reports followed days of turmoil at San Francisco-based Open AI, whose board sacked Altman, but then reinstated him after nearly all of the company\u2019s 750 staff threatened to resign if he were not brought back. Altman also had the support of OpenAI\u2019s biggest investor, Microsoft.   Many experts are concerned that companies such as OpenAI are moving too fast towards developing artificial general intelligence (AGI), the term for a system that can perform tasks at human or above-human levels of intelligence \u2013 and which could, in theory, evade human control. Andrew Rogoyski, of the Institute for People-Centred AI at the University of Surrey, said the existence of a maths-solving large language model (LLM) would be a breakthrough. He said: \u201cThe intrinsic ability of LLMs to do maths is a major step forward, allowing AIs to offer a whole new swath of analytical capabilities. It\u2019s a big step forward.\u201d   In an appearance at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, Altman said: \u201cFour times now in the history of OpenAI, the most recent time was just in the last couple weeks [sic], I\u2019ve gotten to be in the room, when we sort of push the veil of ignorance back and the frontier of discovery forward, and getting to do that is the professional honour of a lifetime.\u201d Open AI was founded as a nonprofit venture with a board that governs a commercial subsidiary, run by Altman. Open AI states that it was established with the goal of developing \u201csafe and beneficial artificial general intelligence for the benefit of humanity\u201d and that the for-profit company would be \u201clegally bound to pursue the nonprofit\u2019s mission.\u201d The emphasis on safety led to the speculation that Altman had been sacked for endangering the company\u2019s core mission.

The artificial intelligence model triggered such alarm with some OpenAI researchers that they wrote to the board of directors before Altman\u2019s dismissal warning that it could threaten humanity, Reuters reported.  The model, called Q* \u2013 and pronounced as \u201cQ Star\u201d \u2013 was able to solve basic maths problems it had not seen before, according to the tech news site The Information, which added that the pace of development behind the system had alarmed some safety researchers. The ability to solve maths problems would be viewed as a significant development in AI. The reports followed days of turmoil at San Francisco-based Open AI, whose board sacked Altman, but then reinstated him after nearly all of the company\u2019s 750 staff threatened to resign if he were not brought back. Altman also had the support of OpenAI\u2019s biggest investor, Microsoft.   Many experts are concerned that companies such as OpenAI are moving too fast towards developing artificial general intelligence (AGI), the term for a system that can perform tasks at human or above-human levels of intelligence \u2013 and which could, in theory, evade human control. Andrew Rogoyski, of the Institute for People-Centred AI at the University of Surrey, said the existence of a maths-solving large language model (LLM) would be a breakthrough. He said: \u201cThe intrinsic ability of LLMs to do maths is a major step forward, allowing AIs to offer a whole new swath of analytical capabilities. It\u2019s a big step forward.\u201d   In an appearance at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, Altman said: \u201cFour times now in the history of OpenAI, the most recent time was just in the last couple weeks [sic], I\u2019ve gotten to be in the room, when we sort of push the veil of ignorance back and the frontier of discovery forward, and getting to do that is the professional honour of a lifetime.\u201d Open AI was founded as a nonprofit venture with a board that governs a commercial subsidiary, run by Altman. Open AI states that it was established with the goal of developing \u201csafe and beneficial artificial general intelligence for the benefit of humanity\u201d and that the for-profit company would be \u201clegally bound to pursue the nonprofit\u2019s mission.\u201d The emphasis on safety led to the speculation that Altman had been sacked for endangering the company\u2019s core mission.

The artificial intelligence model triggered such alarm with some OpenAI researchers that they wrote to the board of directors before Altman\u2019s dismissal warning that it could threaten humanity, Reuters reported.  The model, called Q* \u2013 and pronounced as \u201cQ Star\u201d \u2013 was able to solve basic maths problems it had not seen before, according to the tech news site The Information, which added that the pace of development behind the system had alarmed some safety researchers. The ability to solve maths problems would be viewed as a significant development in AI. The reports followed days of turmoil at San Francisco-based Open AI, whose board sacked Altman, but then reinstated him after nearly all of the company\u2019s 750 staff threatened to resign if he were not brought back. Altman also had the support of OpenAI\u2019s biggest investor, Microsoft.   Many experts are concerned that companies such as OpenAI are moving too fast towards developing artificial general intelligence (AGI), the term for a system that can perform tasks at human or above-human levels of intelligence \u2013 and which could, in theory, evade human control. Andrew Rogoyski, of the Institute for People-Centred AI at the University of Surrey, said the existence of a maths-solving large language model (LLM) would be a breakthrough. He said: \u201cThe intrinsic ability of LLMs to do maths is a major step forward, allowing AIs to offer a whole new swath of analytical capabilities. It\u2019s a big step forward.\u201d   In an appearance at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, Altman said: \u201cFour times now in the history of OpenAI, the most recent time was just in the last couple weeks [sic], I\u2019ve gotten to be in the room, when we sort of push the veil of ignorance back and the frontier of discovery forward, and getting to do that is the professional honour of a lifetime.\u201d Open AI was founded as a nonprofit venture with a board that governs a commercial subsidiary, run by Altman. Open AI states that it was established with the goal of developing \u201csafe and beneficial artificial general intelligence for the benefit of humanity\u201d and that the for-profit company would be \u201clegally bound to pursue the nonprofit\u2019s mission.\u201d The emphasis on safety led to the speculation that Altman had been sacked for endangering the company\u2019s core mission.

The artificial intelligence model triggered such alarm with some OpenAI researchers that they wrote to the board of directors before Altman\u2019s dismissal warning that it could threaten humanity, Reuters reported.  The model, called Q* \u2013 and pronounced as \u201cQ Star\u201d \u2013 was able to solve basic maths problems it had not seen before, according to the tech news site The Information, which added that the pace of development behind the system had alarmed some safety researchers. The ability to solve maths problems would be viewed as a significant development in AI. The reports followed days of turmoil at San Francisco-based Open AI, whose board sacked Altman, but then reinstated him after nearly all of the company\u2019s 750 staff threatened to resign if he were not brought back. Altman also had the support of OpenAI\u2019s biggest investor, Microsoft.   Many experts are concerned that companies such as OpenAI are moving too fast towards developing artificial general intelligence (AGI), the term for a system that can perform tasks at human or above-human levels of intelligence \u2013 and which could, in theory, evade human control. Andrew Rogoyski, of the Institute for People-Centred AI at the University of Surrey, said the existence of a maths-solving large language model (LLM) would be a breakthrough. He said: \u201cThe intrinsic ability of LLMs to do maths is a major step forward, allowing AIs to offer a whole new swath of analytical capabilities. It\u2019s a big step forward.\u201d   In an appearance at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, Altman said: \u201cFour times now in the history of OpenAI, the most recent time was just in the last couple weeks [sic], I\u2019ve gotten to be in the room, when we sort of push the veil of ignorance back and the frontier of discovery forward, and getting to do that is the professional honour of a lifetime.\u201d Open AI was founded as a nonprofit venture with a board that governs a commercial subsidiary, run by Altman. Open AI states that it was established with the goal of developing \u201csafe and beneficial artificial general intelligence for the benefit of humanity\u201d and that the for-profit company would be \u201clegally bound to pursue the nonprofit\u2019s mission.\u201d The emphasis on safety led to the speculation that Altman had been sacked for endangering the company\u2019s core mission.

                            "Read the following passage and answer the given subquestions:  Open AI Staff \u2018Warned Board New System Threatened Humanity\u2019  Open AI was reportedly working on an advanced system that was so powerful that it caused safety concerns among staff at the company before Sam Altman\u2019s sacking. The artificial intelligence model triggered such alarm with some OpenAI researchers that they wrote to the board of directors before Altman\u2019s dismissal warning that it could threaten humanity, Reuters reported.  The model, called Q* \u2013 and pronounced as \u201cQ Star\u201d \u2013 was able to solve basic maths problems it had not seen before, according to the tech news site The Information, which added that the pace of development behind the system had alarmed some safety researchers. The ability to solve maths problems would be viewed as a significant development in AI. The reports followed days of turmoil at San Francisco-based Open AI, whose board sacked Altman, but then reinstated him after nearly all of the company\u2019s 750 staff threatened to resign if he were not brought back. Altman also had the support of OpenAI\u2019s biggest investor, Microsoft.   Many experts are concerned that companies such as OpenAI are moving too fast towards developing artificial general intelligence (AGI), the term for a system that can perform tasks at human or above-human levels of intelligence \u2013 and which could, in theory, evade human control. Andrew Rogoyski, of the Institute for People-Centred AI at the University of Surrey, said the existence of a maths-solving large language model (LLM) would be a breakthrough. He said: \u201cThe intrinsic ability of LLMs to do maths is a major step forward, allowing AIs to offer a whole new swath of analytical capabilities. It\u2019s a big step forward.\u201d   In an appearance at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, Altman said: \u201cFour times now in the history of OpenAI, the most recent time was just in the last couple weeks [sic], I\u2019ve gotten to be in the room, when we sort of push the veil of ignorance back and the frontier of discovery forward, and getting to do that is the professional honour of a lifetime.\u201d Open AI was founded as a nonprofit venture with a board that governs a commercial subsidiary, run by Altman. Open AI states that it was established with the goal of developing \u201csafe and beneficial artificial general intelligence for the benefit of humanity\u201d and that the for-profit company would be \u201clegally bound to pursue the nonprofit\u2019s mission.\u201d The emphasis on safety led to the speculation that Altman had been sacked for endangering the company\u2019s core mission.

        "summary": "Here\u2019s a structured **summary of core topics, concepts, and principles** for the **\"English I (Computer-Based Exam)\"** paper, along with **Mermaid knowledge graphs** to visualize relationships between key themes.\n\n---\n\n### **Core Topics & Concepts**\nThe exam tests **4 broad areas**:\n1. **Reading Comprehension** (Passage-based questions)\n2. **Grammar & Syntax** (Punctuation, sentence structure, parts of speech)\n3. **Vocabulary & Semantics** (Synonyms, antonyms, word replacement, idioms)\n4. **Phonetics & Linguistics** (Syllables, stress, sounds, phonetic markers)\n\n---\n\n### **1. Reading Comprehension**\n#### **Key Concepts**:\n- **Main Idea & Supporting Details**: Identify the central theme (e.g., OpenAI\u2019s Q* model threatening humanity) and supporting evidence (e.g., staff warnings, Altman\u2019s reinstatement).\n- **Inference**: Draw conclusions from implicit information (e.g., \"Altman\u2019s sacking may relate to safety concerns\").\n- **Fact vs. Opinion**: Distinguish between objective facts (e.g., \"Q* solves math problems\") and subjective opinions (e.g., \"AGI could evade human control\").\n- **Author\u2019s Purpose**: Determine why the author includes specific details (e.g., to highlight ethical concerns in AI development).\n- **Context Clues**: Use surrounding text to define unfamiliar words (e.g., \"turmoil\" \u2192 \"confusion\").\n\n#### **Passage-Specific Notes**:\n- **OpenAI Passage**:\n  - **Q*** (pronounced \"Q Star\"): An AI model capable of solving **unseen math problems**, raising **AGI (Artificial General Intelligence)** concerns.\n  - **Key Events**:\n    - Staff warned the board about Q*\u2019s risks.\n    - Altman was sacked but **reinstated** after staff threatened to resign.\n    - Microsoft (OpenAI\u2019s largest investor) supported Altman.\n  - **Themes**: Ethical AI, corporate governance, technological breakthroughs.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Grammar & Syntax**\n#### **Key Rules**:\n- **Punctuation**:\n  - Commas: Separate clauses (e.g., *\"The Kala Ghoda Art District, thronged by tourists, has heritage buildings.\"*).\n  - Hyphens: Compound adjectives (e.g., *\"people-friendly street furniture\"*).\n  - Semicolons: Join independent clauses (e.g., *\"Bored encourages creativity; The Story Room focuses on writing.\"*).\n- **Sentence Structure**:\n  - **Subject-Verb Agreement**:\n    - Singular/plural nouns (e.g., *\"Either Sana or Maitreyi **is** at the party.\"*).\n    - Collective nouns (e.g., *\"The board **regulates** standards.\"*).\n  - **Tenses**:\n    - Present simple (e.g., *\"The school **hosts** a festival.\"*).\n    - Past perfect (e.g., *\"The xerox machine **had not been** working.\"*).\n  - **Conjunctions**:\n    - Coordinating (FANBOYS: *for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so*).\n    - Subordinating (e.g., *\"The baby is crying **because** it is hungry.\"*).\n- **Articles**:\n  - *\"A\"* before consonants (e.g., *\"a long time\"*).\n  - *\"An\"* before vowels (e.g., *\"an hour\"*).\n  - *\"The\"* for specific nouns (e.g., *\"the Gateway of India\"*).\n\n#### **Common Errors**:\n- **Misplaced Modifiers**: Ensure adjectives/adverbs modify the correct word (e.g., *\"She almost drove her kids to school every day.\"* \u2192 Ambiguous).\n- **Parallelism**: Maintain consistent structure (e.g., *\"restoring buildings, **installing** furniture, and **improving** amenities.\"*).\n\n---\n\n### **3. Vocabulary & Semantics**\n#### **Key Skills**:\n- **Synonyms/Antonyms**:\n  - *Trigger* \u2192 **Produce** (synonym); *Turmoil* \u2192 **Calm** (antonym).\n  - *Alarmed* \u2192 **Frightened**; *Reinstate* \u2192 **Restore**.\n- **Word Replacement**:\n  - *\"Swath\"* \u2192 **\"Area\"**; *\"Emphasis\"* \u2192 **\"Stress\"**; *\"Speculation\"* \u2192 **\"Supposition\"**.\n- **Idioms**:\n  - *\"Two peas in a pod\"* \u2192 Very similar.\n  - *\"Sit on the fence\"* \u2192 Avoid taking sides.\n  - *\"Turn a blind eye\"* \u2192 Ignore intentionally.\n- **Modal Verbs**:\n  | Modal | Use Case                          | Example                                  |\n  |-------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n  | Could | Past ability/probability          | *\"She **could** solve the problem.\"*      |\n  | Should| Suggestion                        | *\"We **should** keep away.\"*             |\n  | Shall | Offer/future intention            | *\"**Shall** I watch the baby?\"*         |\n  | Must  | Logical conclusion/necessity     | *\"It **must** be true.\"*                 |\n  | May   | Possibility                      | *\"She **may** not come.\"*                |\n\n---\n\n### **4. Phonetics & Linguistics**\n#### **Key Concepts**:\n- **Syllables**:\n  - *Speculation* \u2192 **4 syllables** (Spec-u-la-tion).\n  - *Revenue* \u2192 **3 syllables** (Rev-en-ue).\n  - *Erode* \u2192 **2 syllables** (E-rode).\n- **Stress Patterns**:\n  - *\"PROject\"* (noun) vs. *\"proJECT\"* (verb).\n- **Phonetic Sounds**:\n  - Aspirated /p/ (e.g., *\"people\"* \u2192 **/p/** in \"peo\" is aspirated; \"ple\" is not).\n  - Plural markers:\n    - /s/ \u2192 After voiceless consonants (e.g., *\"institutes\"*).\n    - /z/ \u2192 After voiced consonants/vowels (e.g., *\"dogs\"*).\n    - /iz/ \u2192 After sibilants (e.g., *\"boxes\"*).\n- **Semi-Vowels**:\n  - /w/ \u2192 Transition between *\"no\"* and *\"other\"* (e.g., *\"no other\"* \u2192 /n\u0259\u028aw\u028c\u00f0\u0259r/).\n\n---\n\n### **Mermaid Knowledge Graphs**\n#### **1.
