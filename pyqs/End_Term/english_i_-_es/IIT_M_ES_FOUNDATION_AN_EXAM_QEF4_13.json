Even the content in liberal arts and humanities courses is considered to be supplementary. Such biases stem from the colonial mindset of \u201cempiricism\u201d as the metric for \u201cgood\u201d or valuable research. Shibashis Chatterjee, a senior professor at the Department of International Relations at Jadavpur University states that the study of humanities and social sciences has been in a state of worldwide crisis for a while now: \u201cSubjects that do not use quantification are labelled as easy.\u201d However, the professor feels that the idea of a competition amongst arts, science and technology is wrong. \u201cThese are complementary fields. To me, it is an identification problem. If natural sciences set the bar and humanities must measure up to it, there is no way they can meet the standards. Unless we agree to create our own standards, these accusations would never end. Hence, we must stop making these comparisons,\u201d he states. \nThe professor of political thought and critical theory also adds that how society looks at knowledge is a political question. \u201cFrom resource allocation to salaries, the logic of instrumentality trumps everything else,\u201d Chatterjee states. The narratives through which liberal arts courses are shunned are all too familiar. Social sciences never had democratic equality with the natural/biological sciences and technological education. They are dismissed either as questionable or as useless. Modern education is predicated upon science and technology. It has increasingly reduced the space for criticality and reflective variations on the theme of instrumentality, and humanities and social sciences are automatically downgraded. \nIn capitalist societies, education is just another financial sector and the loftier philosophical goals of education \u2013 the pursuance of knowledge and happiness in knowing \u2013 lie discarded. It is significant that the students who pursue humanities do not study for the money. Humanities cannot be made more appealing by tying it to vocational needs. \u201cThat would be sounding the death knell to liberal education,\u201d states Chatterjee. Humanities can flourish when democratic values thrive in society, the spirit of questioning is highly regarded, and liberalism enjoys legitimacy. In other words, if philosophy matters to our lives, humanities is indispensable. \nBut most researchers and students of humanities do not think that any autocratic state would be fundamentally interested in reviving humanities and social sciences since these disciplines encourage critical thinking and questioning of authority structures. The more authoritarian states become, the less tolerant they will be of humanities and social sciences. \nExcerpted from: \nBose, Rakhi. \u201cThe Easy \u2018A\u2019.\u201d Outlook, 11 Jul. 2023, pp. 46-50."

The washing machines on all floors have stopped working, but the hostel authorities have not taken any measures to get them repaired despite repeated pleas by the student community.  \nOne of the elevators in the hostel ceased to work a year ago and has not yet been repaired. Consequently, there is overcrowding in the one available elevator, which, in addition to being inconvenient, is a grave safety hazard. Several toilets in the hostel do not have operational flushes. This causes unsanitary living conditions in the hostel and does not aid the cause of the residents\u2019 well-being. \nInedible and possibly hazardous materials such as strands of a steel scrubber, insects and glass shards have lately been found in the mess food. A sickly looking rat was seen scurrying through the mess hall during dinner time. The green moong dal served in the mess in the past two weeks tasted discernibly stale. As evident from these instances, the mess management is unscrupulously lax in the discharge of their duties. \nThe newly admitted students have been accommodated in rooms without almirahs, tables and chairs.

The washing machines on all floors have stopped working, but the hostel authorities have not taken any measures to get them repaired despite repeated pleas by the student community.  \nOne of the elevators in the hostel ceased to work a year ago and has not yet been repaired. Consequently, there is overcrowding in the one available elevator, which, in addition to being inconvenient, is a grave safety hazard. Several toilets in the hostel do not have operational flushes. This causes unsanitary living conditions in the hostel and does not aid the cause of the residents\u2019 well-being. \nInedible and possibly hazardous materials such as strands of a steel scrubber, insects and glass shards have lately been found in the mess food. A sickly looking rat was seen scurrying through the mess hall during dinner time. The green moong dal served in the mess in the past two weeks tasted discernibly stale. As evident from these instances, the mess management is unscrupulously lax in the discharge of their duties. \nThe newly admitted students have been accommodated in rooms without almirahs, tables and chairs. Even after the newly ordered furniture reached the hostel, no provisions were made for its being shifted to the rooms in need. \nI kindly request you to address these pressing concerns with the hostel management and enable their hasty redressal.  \nYours sincerely, [Sign] XYZ General Secretary  Ph: 1234567890",

The washing machines on all floors have stopped working, but the hostel authorities have not taken any measures to get them repaired despite repeated pleas by the student community.  \nOne of the elevators in the hostel ceased to work a year ago and has not yet been repaired. Consequently, there is overcrowding in the one available elevator, which, in addition to being inconvenient, is a grave safety hazard. Several toilets in the hostel do not have operational flushes. This causes unsanitary living conditions in the hostel and does not aid the cause of the residents\u2019 well-being. \nInedible and possibly hazardous materials such as strands of a steel scrubber, insects and glass shards have lately been found in the mess food. A sickly looking rat was seen scurrying through the mess hall during dinner time. The green moong dal served in the mess in the past two weeks tasted discernibly stale. As evident from these instances, the mess management is unscrupulously lax in the discharge of their duties. \nThe newly admitted students have been accommodated in rooms without almirahs, tables and chairs. Even after the newly ordered furniture reached the hostel, no provisions were made for its being shifted to the rooms in need. \nI kindly request you to address these pressing concerns with the hostel management and enable their hasty redressal.  \nYours sincerely, [Sign] XYZ General Secretary  Ph: 1234567890"

The washing machines on all floors have stopped working, but the hostel authorities have not taken any measures to get them repaired despite repeated pleas by the student community.  \nOne of the elevators in the hostel ceased to work a year ago and has not yet been repaired. Consequently, there is overcrowding in the one available elevator, which, in addition to being inconvenient, is a grave safety hazard. Several toilets in the hostel do not have operational flushes. This causes unsanitary living conditions in the hostel and does not aid the cause of the residents\u2019 well-being. \nInedible and possibly hazardous materials such as strands of a steel scrubber, insects and glass shards have lately been found in the mess food. A sickly looking rat was seen scurrying through the mess hall during dinner time. The green moong dal served in the mess in the past two weeks tasted discernibly stale. As evident from these instances, the mess management is unscrupulously lax in the discharge of their duties. \nThe newly admitted students have been accommodated in rooms without almirahs, tables and chairs. Even after the newly ordered furniture reached the hostel, no provisions were made for its being shifted to the rooms in need. \nI kindly request you to address these pressing concerns with the hostel management and enable their hasty redressal.  \nYours sincerely, [Sign] XYZ General Secretary  Ph: 1234567890",

        "summary": "Here\u2019s a structured **summary of core topics, concepts, and principles** for the **\"Foundation Level: English I (Computer-Based Exam)\"** based on the provided question paper.\nThe exam tests **reading comprehension, grammar, vocabulary, formal writing, and communication skills** in English.\nThe questions are divided into **4 broad themes**:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Reading Comprehension (Passage-Based Questions)**\n**Core Topics:**\n- **Critical analysis** of passages (e.g., biases in education, role of humanities vs. sciences).\n- **Vocabulary in context** (e.g., synonyms, antonyms, word meanings like \"appendage,\" \"indispensable,\" \"loftier\").\n- **Inference and interpretation** (e.g., author\u2019s tone, implied meanings, political/social commentary).\n- **Grammar in context** (e.g., parts of speech, noun/plural forms like \"biases,\" adjectives like \"colonial\").\n\n**Key Concepts:**\n- **Empiricism vs. qualitative research**: Colonial mindset favoring quantification in \"true sciences\" (e.g., natural sciences) over humanities/social sciences.\n- **Complementarity of fields**: Arts, science, and technology are **interdependent**, not competitive.\n- **Political implications of education**:\n  - Authoritarian states suppress humanities (critical thinking threatens authority).\n  - Capitalist societies reduce education to a **financial sector**, sidelining philosophical goals (e.g., \"pursuance of knowledge\").\n- **Democratic values and humanities**: Flourish when **questioning, liberalism, and legitimacy** of philosophy are prioritized.\n\n**Passage-Specific Terms:**\n| Term               | Meaning/Context                                                                 |\n|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Appendage          | Supplementary part (synonyms: **attachment, accessory**; *not* \"approbation\"). |\n| Indispensable      | Absolutely necessary.                                                          |\n| Loftier            | Comparative form of \"lofty\" (positive: **lofty**).                             |\n| Colonial mindset   | Bias toward **empiricism** (quantification = \"good\" research).                 |\n| Instrumentality    | Focus on practical utility over critical/reflective thinking.                  |\n| Death knell        | Metaphor for the **end of liberal education** if humanities are vocationalized. |\n\n---\n\n### **2. Grammar and Syntax**\n**Core Topics:**\n- **Subject-verb agreement** (e.g., \"None of the chairs **needs** repair\").\n- **Tense consistency** (past/past continuous in narratives; present perfect continuous for duration: \"I **have been studying** Biology for 3 hours\").\n- **Prepositions** (e.g., \"good **at** swimming,\" \"sat **on** a bench\").\n- **Articles** (e.g., \"an hour\" [vowel sound], \"the ice cream stand\").\n- **Modals** (e.g., \"**Will** teach you!\" for warnings; \"**shall**\" for suggestions).\n- **Phrasal verbs** (e.g., \"held off\" = resisted; \"put on\" = wore).\n- **Idioms** (e.g., \"out of my league\" = too advanced; \"in the clear\" = not guilty).\n\n**Key Rules:**\n1. **Subject-Verb Agreement**:\n   - Singular subjects (e.g., \"none,\" \"each\") take singular verbs: *\"None of the chairs **needs** repair.\"*\n   - Collective nouns (e.g., \"all\") can be singular/plural based on context: *\"All of the hard drives **are** in this box.\"*\n2. **Tenses**:\n   - **Present Perfect Continuous**: Action started in past, continues now (e.g., *\"I have been studying\"*).\n   - **Future Perfect Continuous**: Action will continue until a future time (e.g., *\"She will have been driving for an hour by then\"*).\n3. **Prepositions**:\n   - **\"Good at\"** for skills; **\"on/at/in\"** for locations/time.\n4. **Articles**:\n   - **\"An\"** before vowel **sounds** (e.g., \"an hour\" [/a\u028a\u0259/]), not just vowel letters.\n5. **Passive Voice**:\n   - *\"The king\u2019s army **held off** the aggressors\"* (phrasal verb = actively resisted).\n\n---\n\n### **3. Vocabulary and Word Usage**\n**Core Topics:**\n- **Synonyms/antonyms** (e.g., \"room\" = compartment; \"road\" = thoroughfare).\n- **Word stress** (e.g., **\"DEcrease\"** [noun] vs. \"de**CREASE**\" [verb]).\n- **Syllabication** (e.g., \"compensation\" = **4 syllables**: com-pen-sa-tion).\n- **Consonant clusters** (e.g., \"against\" = **final CCC** [/\u0261\u025bnst/]).\n- **Concrete/abstract nouns** (e.g., \"mountain\" [concrete] vs. \"love\" [abstract]).\n\n**Key Examples:**\n| Word/Concept       | Example/Rule                                                                 |\n|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Synonyms**       | Jug = pitcher; tools = equipment; helper = aide.                            |\n| **Word Stress**    | **\"DEcrease\"** (noun) in *\"a decrease in cereals sold.\"*                   |\n| **Semi-vowel**     | **/y/** in \"he arrived\" (transition between vowels).                       |\n| **Aspiration**     | **/p/** in \"people\" is aspirated in the **first syllable** (/\u02c8pi\u02d0p\u0259l/).     |\n\n---\n\n### **4. Formal Writing and Communication**\n**Core Topics:**\n- **Formal letters** (structure: sender\u2019s address, salutation, body, closing, signature).\n- **Purpose and tone**: Polite, **impersonal**, and **direct** (e.g., complaint letter to Dean).\n- **Transitional devices** (e.g., *\"As evident from these instances,\"* *\"Consequently\"*).\n- **Argumentation strategies**: **Examples** (most used in the hostel letter), facts, urgency.\n- **Telephonic etiquette**: Polite phrases (e.g., *\"I\u2019d like to schedule an appointment\"*).\n\n**Key Components of a Formal Letter:**\n1. **Sender\u2019s Address**: Top-left (e.g., \"The General Secretary, Narmada Hostel\").\n2. **Date**: Below sender\u2019s address.\n3. **Recipient\u2019s Address**: Left-aligned (e.g., \"The Dean, Hostel Affairs\").\n4. **Subject Line**: Clear purpose (e.g., *\"Unavailability of Necessary Facilities\"*).\n5. **Salutation**: *\"Respected Sir/Madam,\"*\n6. **Body**:\n   - **Topic sentence**: *\"I am writing to draw your attention to...\"*\n   - **Supporting details**: List issues (e.g., broken elevators, unsanitary mess).\n   - **Transitions**: *\"Consequently,\" \"As evident from...\"*\n7. **Closing**: *\"Yours sincerely,\"* + signature + designation.\n8. **Urgency**: *\"I kindly request hasty redressal.\"*\n\n**Telephonic Conversation Etiquette:**\n| Scenario               | Polite Response                                                                 |\n|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Booking appointment    | *\"I\u2019d like to schedule an appointment with Dr. Agarwal, please.\"*              |\n| Clarifying name        | *\"I\u2019m sorry, your voice is breaking. Could you repeat that?\"*                   |\n| Confirming past visit  | *\"I\u2019ve visited Dr. Agarwal before.\"*                                            |\n| Scheduling time        | *\"I would like to schedule my appointment for 10:30 AM tomorrow.\"*            |\n| Closing                | *\"Thank you so much.\"*                                                          |\n\n---\n\n### **5. Linguistics and Phonetics**\n**Core Topics:**\n- **Syllables** (e.g., \"football\" = **2 syllables**, stressed on **first**).\n- **Consonant clusters** (initial/final CC/CCC, e.g., \"against\" = **final CCC**).\n- **Aspiration**: Strong puff of air in **initial /p/** (e.g., \"people\").\n- **Semi-vowels**: **/y/** (e.g., \"he arrived\") and **/w/** (e.g., \"we are\").\n\n**Key Rules:**\n- **Stress in compound words**: First syllable (e.g., **\"FOOT**ball\").\n- **Aspiration**: Occurs in **stressed syllables** (e.g., **\"P**eople\" vs. \"peo**ple**\").\n\n---\n\n### **Mermaid Knowledge Graphs**\n#### **Graph 1: Reading Comprehension Themes**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Passage: 'The Easy A'] --> B[Core Theme: Humanities vs. Sciences]\n    B --> C[Colonial Mindset]\n    C --> D[Empiricism = 'Good' Research]\n    C --> E[Quantification Bias]\n    B --> F[Complementarity of Fields]\n    F --> G[Arts + Science + Tech = Interdependent]\n    B --> H[Political Implications]\n    H --> I[Authoritarian States Suppress Humanities]\n    H --> J[Capitalism Reduces Education to Finance]\n    B --> K[Democratic Values]\n    K --> L[Humanities Flourish with Questioning/Liberalism]\n```\n\n#### **Graph 2: Grammar and Syntax**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Grammar] --> B[Subject-Verb Agreement]\n    B --> C[Singular Subjects: 'needs' not 'need']\n    A --> D[Tenses]\n    D --> E[Present Perfect Continuous: 'have been studying']\n    D --> F[Future Perfect Continuous: 'will have been driving']\n    A --> G[Prepositions]\n    G --> H['good at swimming']\n    A --> I[Articles]\n    I --> J['an hour' vowel sound]\n```\n\n#### **Graph 3: Formal Writing**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Formal Letter] --> B[Structure]\n    B --> C[Sender's Address]\n    B --> D[Recipient's Address]\n    B --> E[Subject Line]\n    B --> F[Salutation: 'Respected Sir']\n    B --> G[Body: Topic + Examples]\n    G --> H[Transitions: 'Consequently']\n    B --> I[Closing: 'Yours sincerely']\n    A --> J[Telephonic Etiquette]\n    J --> K[Polite Requests: 'I'd like to...']\n    J --> L[Clarifications: 'Could you repeat?']\n```\n\n#### **Graph 4: Vocabulary and Phonetics**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Vocabulary] --> B[Synonyms]\n    B --> C['Room = Compartment']\n    A --> D[Word Stress]\n    D --> E['DEcrease' noun vs. deCREASE verb]\n    A --> F[Phonetics]\n    F --> G[Semi-vowels: /y/ in 'he arrived']\n    F --> H[Aspiration: /p/ in 'people']\n    A --> I[Syllables]\n    I --> J['Compensation = 4 syllables']\n```\n\n---\n### **Exam Preparation Tips**\n1. **Reading Comprehension**:\n   - Practice **summarizing passages** in 3 bullet points (theme, arguments, implications).\n   - Learn **academic vocabulary** (e.g., \"indispensable,\" \"instrumentality\").\n2. **Grammar**:\n   - Master **subject-verb agreement** (singular/plural subjects).\n   - Review **tenses** (perfect continuous for duration).\n3. **Formal Writing**:\n   - Memorize **letter formats** (sender/recipient addresses, salutations).\n   - Use **transitional phrases** (\"Consequently,\" \"As evident from...\").\n4. **Vocabulary**:\n   - Study **synonyms/antonyms** (e.g., \"appendage\" \u2260 \"approbation\").\n   - Practice **word stress** (noun vs. verb forms).\n5. **Phonetics**:\n   - Identify **syllables** (clap method) and **stress patterns**.\n   - Recognize **aspirated consonants** (initial /p/, /t/, /k/).",
