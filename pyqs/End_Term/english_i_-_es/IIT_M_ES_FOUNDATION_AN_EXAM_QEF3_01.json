These phenomena are often linked to the impacts of global climate change and habitat loss due to industrial agriculture. According to a study published in Nature, climate change and agriculture seem to have a synergistic effect on insect biodiversity, with each magnifying the declines caused by the other.  For the study, researchers from University College London (UCL) analysed data from more than 750,000 samples of nearly 18,000 insect species that were collected from 6,000 sites around the world over the last 20 years. They compared changes over time in the samples\u2019 reported numbers on insect populations and biodiversity to the average and maximum temperatures as well as land use at each site. Each area was categorised as having primary vegetation or low or high-intensity agriculture. The researchers found that rising temperatures are linked to greater population reductions and that there was more loss of species in areas where natural habitats were cleared to make room for agriculture than in undeveloped regions. Areas with temperature increases but undisturbed insect habitats, or disturbed habitats but relatively steady temperatures, experienced smaller losses. In high-intensity agriculture areas affected by rising temperatures one standard deviation above baseline fluctuations, such as some sites in Brazil, the number of insects dropped by up to 49 percent, and the number of species present dropped by 27 percent.   \u201cIn this case, the habitat loss and climate change can often be worse than if they were acting on their own, as one can make the impact of the other worse and vice versa,\u201d study author and UCL ecologist Charlotte Outhwaite tells the Associated Press. \u201cWe\u2019re missing part of the picture if we are only looking at these things individually.\u201d Part of the problem, Outhwaite explains, is that agricultural development reduces tree cover, making rising temperatures even deadlier for insects that are unable to find shade. Those that survive may then migrate to a new area that\u2019s not as well suited to them. \u201cOur findings highlight the urgency of actions to preserve natural habitats, slow the expansion of high-intensity agriculture, and cut emissions to mitigate climate change,\u201d Outhwaite tells BBC News.

These phenomena are often linked to the impacts of global climate change and habitat loss due to industrial agriculture. According to a study published in Nature, climate change and agriculture seem to have a synergistic effect on insect biodiversity, with each magnifying the declines caused by the other.  For the study, researchers from University College London (UCL) analysed data from more than 750,000 samples of nearly 18,000 insect species that were collected from 6,000 sites around the world over the last 20 years. They compared changes over time in the samples\u2019 reported numbers on insect populations and biodiversity to the average and maximum temperatures as well as land use at each site. Each area was categorised as having primary vegetation or low or high-intensity agriculture. The researchers found that rising temperatures are linked to greater population reductions and that there was more loss of species in areas where natural habitats were cleared to make room for agriculture than in undeveloped regions. Areas with temperature increases but undisturbed insect habitats, or disturbed habitats but relatively steady temperatures, experienced smaller losses. In high-intensity agriculture areas affected by rising temperatures one standard deviation above baseline fluctuations, such as some sites in Brazil, the number of insects dropped by up to 49 percent, and the number of species present dropped by 27 percent.   \u201cIn this case, the habitat loss and climate change can often be worse than if they were acting on their own, as one can make the impact of the other worse and vice versa,\u201d study author and UCL ecologist Charlotte Outhwaite tells the Associated Press. \u201cWe\u2019re missing part of the picture if we are only looking at these things individually.\u201d Part of the problem, Outhwaite explains, is that agricultural development reduces tree cover, making rising temperatures even deadlier for insects that are unable to find shade. Those that survive may then migrate to a new area that\u2019s not as well suited to them. \u201cOur findings highlight the urgency of actions to preserve natural habitats, slow the expansion of high-intensity agriculture, and cut emissions to mitigate climate change,\u201d Outhwaite tells BBC News.

                            "Read the following passage and answer the given subquestions :  Climate Change and Agriculture Together Halve Insect Populations   In recent years, researchers have reported alarming decreases in both the population numbers and the diversity of insects. These phenomena are often linked to the impacts of global climate change and habitat loss due to industrial agriculture. According to a study published in Nature, climate change and agriculture seem to have a synergistic effect on insect biodiversity, with each magnifying the declines caused by the other.  For the study, researchers from University College London (UCL) analysed data from more than 750,000 samples of nearly 18,000 insect species that were collected from 6,000 sites around the world over the last 20 years. They compared changes over time in the samples\u2019 reported numbers on insect populations and biodiversity to the average and maximum temperatures as well as land use at each site. Each area was categorised as having primary vegetation or low or high-intensity agriculture. The researchers found that rising temperatures are linked to greater population reductions and that there was more loss of species in areas where natural habitats were cleared to make room for agriculture than in undeveloped regions. Areas with temperature increases but undisturbed insect habitats, or disturbed habitats but relatively steady temperatures, experienced smaller losses. In high-intensity agriculture areas affected by rising temperatures one standard deviation above baseline fluctuations, such as some sites in Brazil, the number of insects dropped by up to 49 percent, and the number of species present dropped by 27 percent.   \u201cIn this case, the habitat loss and climate change can often be worse than if they were acting on their own, as one can make the impact of the other worse and vice versa,\u201d study author and UCL ecologist Charlotte Outhwaite tells the Associated Press. \u201cWe\u2019re missing part of the picture if we are only looking at these things individually.\u201d Part of the problem, Outhwaite explains, is that agricultural development reduces tree cover, making rising temperatures even deadlier for insects that are unable to find shade. Those that survive may then migrate to a new area that\u2019s not as well suited to them. \u201cOur findings highlight the urgency of actions to preserve natural habitats, slow the expansion of high-intensity agriculture, and cut emissions to mitigate climate change,\u201d Outhwaite tells BBC News.

These phenomena are often linked to the impacts of global climate change and habitat loss due to industrial agriculture. According to a study published in Nature, climate change and agriculture seem to have a synergistic effect on insect biodiversity, with each magnifying the declines caused by the other.  For the study, researchers from University College London (UCL) analysed data from more than 750,000 samples of nearly 18,000 insect species that were collected from 6,000 sites around the world over the last 20 years. They compared changes over time in the samples\u2019 reported numbers on insect populations and biodiversity to the average and maximum temperatures as well as land use at each site. Each area was categorised as having primary vegetation or low or high-intensity agriculture. The researchers found that rising temperatures are linked to greater population reductions and that there was more loss of species in areas where natural habitats were cleared to make room for agriculture than in undeveloped regions. Areas with temperature increases but undisturbed insect habitats, or disturbed habitats but relatively steady temperatures, experienced smaller losses. In high-intensity agriculture areas affected by rising temperatures one standard deviation above baseline fluctuations, such as some sites in Brazil, the number of insects dropped by up to 49 percent, and the number of species present dropped by 27 percent.   \u201cIn this case, the habitat loss and climate change can often be worse than if they were acting on their own, as one can make the impact of the other worse and vice versa,\u201d study author and UCL ecologist Charlotte Outhwaite tells the Associated Press. \u201cWe\u2019re missing part of the picture if we are only looking at these things individually.\u201d Part of the problem, Outhwaite explains, is that agricultural development reduces tree cover, making rising temperatures even deadlier for insects that are unable to find shade. Those that survive may then migrate to a new area that\u2019s not as well suited to them. \u201cOur findings highlight the urgency of actions to preserve natural habitats, slow the expansion of high-intensity agriculture, and cut emissions to mitigate climate change,\u201d Outhwaite tells BBC News.

These phenomena are often linked to the impacts of global climate change and habitat loss due to industrial agriculture. According to a study published in Nature, climate change and agriculture seem to have a synergistic effect on insect biodiversity, with each magnifying the declines caused by the other.  For the study, researchers from University College London (UCL) analysed data from more than 750,000 samples of nearly 18,000 insect species that were collected from 6,000 sites around the world over the last 20 years. They compared changes over time in the samples\u2019 reported numbers on insect populations and biodiversity to the average and maximum temperatures as well as land use at each site. Each area was categorised as having primary vegetation or low or high-intensity agriculture. The researchers found that rising temperatures are linked to greater population reductions and that there was more loss of species in areas where natural habitats were cleared to make room for agriculture than in undeveloped regions. Areas with temperature increases but undisturbed insect habitats, or disturbed habitats but relatively steady temperatures, experienced smaller losses. In high-intensity agriculture areas affected by rising temperatures one standard deviation above baseline fluctuations, such as some sites in Brazil, the number of insects dropped by up to 49 percent, and the number of species present dropped by 27 percent.   \u201cIn this case, the habitat loss and climate change can often be worse than if they were acting on their own, as one can make the impact of the other worse and vice versa,\u201d study author and UCL ecologist Charlotte Outhwaite tells the Associated Press. \u201cWe\u2019re missing part of the picture if we are only looking at these things individually.\u201d Part of the problem, Outhwaite explains, is that agricultural development reduces tree cover, making rising temperatures even deadlier for insects that are unable to find shade. Those that survive may then migrate to a new area that\u2019s not as well suited to them. \u201cOur findings highlight the urgency of actions to preserve natural habitats, slow the expansion of high-intensity agriculture, and cut emissions to mitigate climate change,\u201d Outhwaite tells BBC News.

                            "Read the following passage and answer the given subquestions :  Climate Change and Agriculture Together Halve Insect Populations   In recent years, researchers have reported alarming decreases in both the population numbers and the diversity of insects. These phenomena are often linked to the impacts of global climate change and habitat loss due to industrial agriculture. According to a study published in Nature, climate change and agriculture seem to have a synergistic effect on insect biodiversity, with each magnifying the declines caused by the other.  For the study, researchers from University College London (UCL) analysed data from more than 750,000 samples of nearly 18,000 insect species that were collected from 6,000 sites around the world over the last 20 years. They compared changes over time in the samples\u2019 reported numbers on insect populations and biodiversity to the average and maximum temperatures as well as land use at each site. Each area was categorised as having primary vegetation or low or high-intensity agriculture. The researchers found that rising temperatures are linked to greater population reductions and that there was more loss of species in areas where natural habitats were cleared to make room for agriculture than in undeveloped regions. Areas with temperature increases but undisturbed insect habitats, or disturbed habitats but relatively steady temperatures, experienced smaller losses. In high-intensity agriculture areas affected by rising temperatures one standard deviation above baseline fluctuations, such as some sites in Brazil, the number of insects dropped by up to 49 percent, and the number of species present dropped by 27 percent.   \u201cIn this case, the habitat loss and climate change can often be worse than if they were acting on their own, as one can make the impact of the other worse and vice versa,\u201d study author and UCL ecologist Charlotte Outhwaite tells the Associated Press. \u201cWe\u2019re missing part of the picture if we are only looking at these things individually.\u201d Part of the problem, Outhwaite explains, is that agricultural development reduces tree cover, making rising temperatures even deadlier for insects that are unable to find shade. Those that survive may then migrate to a new area that\u2019s not as well suited to them. \u201cOur findings highlight the urgency of actions to preserve natural habitats, slow the expansion of high-intensity agriculture, and cut emissions to mitigate climate change,\u201d Outhwaite tells BBC News.

These phenomena are often linked to the impacts of global climate change and habitat loss due to industrial agriculture. According to a study published in Nature, climate change and agriculture seem to have a synergistic effect on insect biodiversity, with each magnifying the declines caused by the other.  For the study, researchers from University College London (UCL) analysed data from more than 750,000 samples of nearly 18,000 insect species that were collected from 6,000 sites around the world over the last 20 years. They compared changes over time in the samples\u2019 reported numbers on insect populations and biodiversity to the average and maximum temperatures as well as land use at each site. Each area was categorised as having primary vegetation or low or high-intensity agriculture. The researchers found that rising temperatures are linked to greater population reductions and that there was more loss of species in areas where natural habitats were cleared to make room for agriculture than in undeveloped regions. Areas with temperature increases but undisturbed insect habitats, or disturbed habitats but relatively steady temperatures, experienced smaller losses. In high-intensity agriculture areas affected by rising temperatures one standard deviation above baseline fluctuations, such as some sites in Brazil, the number of insects dropped by up to 49 percent, and the number of species present dropped by 27 percent.   \u201cIn this case, the habitat loss and climate change can often be worse than if they were acting on their own, as one can make the impact of the other worse and vice versa,\u201d study author and UCL ecologist Charlotte Outhwaite tells the Associated Press. \u201cWe\u2019re missing part of the picture if we are only looking at these things individually.\u201d Part of the problem, Outhwaite explains, is that agricultural development reduces tree cover, making rising temperatures even deadlier for insects that are unable to find shade. Those that survive may then migrate to a new area that\u2019s not as well suited to them. \u201cOur findings highlight the urgency of actions to preserve natural habitats, slow the expansion of high-intensity agriculture, and cut emissions to mitigate climate change,\u201d Outhwaite tells BBC News.

                            "Read the following passage and answer the given subquestions :  Climate Change and Agriculture Together Halve Insect Populations   In recent years, researchers have reported alarming decreases in both the population numbers and the diversity of insects. These phenomena are often linked to the impacts of global climate change and habitat loss due to industrial agriculture. According to a study published in Nature, climate change and agriculture seem to have a synergistic effect on insect biodiversity, with each magnifying the declines caused by the other.  For the study, researchers from University College London (UCL) analysed data from more than 750,000 samples of nearly 18,000 insect species that were collected from 6,000 sites around the world over the last 20 years. They compared changes over time in the samples\u2019 reported numbers on insect populations and biodiversity to the average and maximum temperatures as well as land use at each site. Each area was categorised as having primary vegetation or low or high-intensity agriculture. The researchers found that rising temperatures are linked to greater population reductions and that there was more loss of species in areas where natural habitats were cleared to make room for agriculture than in undeveloped regions. Areas with temperature increases but undisturbed insect habitats, or disturbed habitats but relatively steady temperatures, experienced smaller losses. In high-intensity agriculture areas affected by rising temperatures one standard deviation above baseline fluctuations, such as some sites in Brazil, the number of insects dropped by up to 49 percent, and the number of species present dropped by 27 percent.   \u201cIn this case, the habitat loss and climate change can often be worse than if they were acting on their own, as one can make the impact of the other worse and vice versa,\u201d study author and UCL ecologist Charlotte Outhwaite tells the Associated Press. \u201cWe\u2019re missing part of the picture if we are only looking at these things individually.\u201d Part of the problem, Outhwaite explains, is that agricultural development reduces tree cover, making rising temperatures even deadlier for insects that are unable to find shade. Those that survive may then migrate to a new area that\u2019s not as well suited to them. \u201cOur findings highlight the urgency of actions to preserve natural habitats, slow the expansion of high-intensity agriculture, and cut emissions to mitigate climate change,\u201d Outhwaite tells BBC News.

Areas with temperature increases but undisturbed insect habitats, or disturbed habitats but relatively steady temperatures, experienced smaller losses. In high-intensity agriculture areas affected by rising temperatures one standard deviation above baseline fluctuations, such as some sites in Brazil, the number of insects dropped by up to 49 percent, and the number of species present dropped by 27 percent.   \u201cIn this case, the habitat loss and climate change can often be worse than if they were acting on their own, as one can make the impact of the other worse and vice versa,\u201d study author and UCL ecologist Charlotte Outhwaite tells the Associated Press. \u201cWe\u2019re missing part of the picture if we are only looking at these things individually.\u201d Part of the problem, Outhwaite explains, is that agricultural development reduces tree cover, making rising temperatures even deadlier for insects that are unable to find shade. Those that survive may then migrate to a new area that\u2019s not as well suited to them. \u201cOur findings highlight the urgency of actions to preserve natural habitats, slow the expansion of high-intensity agriculture, and cut emissions to mitigate climate change,\u201d Outhwaite tells BBC News.

These phenomena are often linked to the impacts of global climate change and habitat loss due to industrial agriculture. According to a study published in Nature, climate change and agriculture seem to have a synergistic effect on insect biodiversity, with each magnifying the declines caused by the other.  For the study, researchers from University College London (UCL) analysed data from more than 750,000 samples of nearly 18,000 insect species that were collected from 6,000 sites around the world over the last 20 years. They compared changes over time in the samples\u2019 reported numbers on insect populations and biodiversity to the average and maximum temperatures as well as land use at each site. Each area was categorised as having primary vegetation or low or high-intensity agriculture. The researchers found that rising temperatures are linked to greater population reductions and that there was more loss of species in areas where natural habitats were cleared to make room for agriculture than in undeveloped regions. Areas with temperature increases but undisturbed insect habitats, or disturbed habitats but relatively steady temperatures, experienced smaller losses. In high-intensity agriculture areas affected by rising temperatures one standard deviation above baseline fluctuations, such as some sites in Brazil, the number of insects dropped by up to 49 percent, and the number of species present dropped by 27 percent.   \u201cIn this case, the habitat loss and climate change can often be worse than if they were acting on their own, as one can make the impact of the other worse and vice versa,\u201d study author and UCL ecologist Charlotte Outhwaite tells the Associated Press. \u201cWe\u2019re missing part of the picture if we are only looking at these things individually.\u201d Part of the problem, Outhwaite explains, is that agricultural development reduces tree cover, making rising temperatures even deadlier for insects that are unable to find shade. Those that survive may then migrate to a new area that\u2019s not as well suited to them. \u201cOur findings highlight the urgency of actions to preserve natural habitats, slow the expansion of high-intensity agriculture, and cut emissions to mitigate climate change,\u201d Outhwaite tells BBC News.

Criminals who were given suspended sentences because of prison conditions include an inmate who poured boiling water over a prison guard, but had his six-month custodial sentence quashed, and a drug driver without a licence who had led the police on a high-speed chase.

        "summary": "Here\u2019s a structured **summary of core topics, concepts, and principles** for the **\"Foundation Level: English I (Computer-Based Exam)\"** based on the provided question paper.\nThe exam tests **reading comprehension, grammar, vocabulary, syntax, phonetics, and communication skills** in English.\nNo equations are required for this subject, but rules, definitions, and contextual usage are critical.\n\n---\n\n### **Core Topics & Concepts**\n#### **1. Reading Comprehension**\n   - **Key Skills**:\n     - Identifying main ideas, supporting details, and inferences.\n     - Understanding **synonyms/antonyms** in context (e.g., \"magnifying\" \u2192 \"intensifying,\" \"decline\" as a synonym for \"reduction\").\n     - Analyzing **cause-effect relationships** (e.g., climate change + agriculture \u2192 insect population decline).\n     - Recognizing **figures of speech** (e.g., \"synergistic effect,\" \"vice versa\").\n     - Interpreting **technical vocabulary** (e.g., legal terms like \"custodial sentence,\" \"quashed\").\n   - **Passage Types**:\n     - Scientific articles (e.g., climate change, biodiversity).\n     - News reports (e.g., prison overcrowding, judicial decisions).\n   - **Question Types**:\n     - Fact-based (e.g., \"Which of the following is NOT TRUE?\").\n     - Inference-based (e.g., \"What is the urgency highlighted by the study?\").\n     - Vocabulary-in-context (e.g., \"What does \u2018synergistic effect\u2019 mean?\").\n     - Syntax/grammar in passages (e.g., \"How is \u2018decreases\u2019 used in the sentence?\").\n\n#### **2. Grammar**\n   - **Subject-Verb Agreement**:\n     - Singular/plural subjects (e.g., \"The Chief Minister, together with his secretary, **greets** the delegation\").\n     - Collective nouns (e.g., \"The President and Vice President **have** visited\").\n     - Indefinite pronouns (e.g., \"Everyone **has** done their work\").\n   - **Tenses**:\n     - Present simple (e.g., \"The school **organizes** a festival\").\n     - Past simple (e.g., \"You **could** have let me through\").\n   - **Articles**:\n     - Definite/indefinite (e.g., \"90 miles **an** hour\").\n     - Omission (e.g., \"He drives at a speed of 90 miles **__** hour\" \u2192 \"an\").\n   - **Prepositions**:\n     - Contextual usage (e.g., \"talking **about**,\" \"upset **about**\").\n   - **Modals**:\n     - Speculative possibility (**might**).\n     - Opportunity (**can**).\n     - Past ability (**could**).\n     - Advice (**ought to**).\n     - Permission (**may**).\n   - **Sentence Structure**:\n     - Clause combination (e.g., rewriting fragmented quotes into coherent sentences).\n     - Active/passive voice (implied in comprehension questions).\n\n#### **3. Vocabulary**\n   - **Synonyms/Antonyms**:\n     - Example pairs:\n       - Synonym: \"intensifying\" (for \"magnifying\").\n       - Antonym: \"depletion\" (for \"expansion\").\n   - **Idioms/Phrases**:\n     - \"Sit on the fence\" (neutrality).\n     - \"Miss the boat\" (lose an opportunity).\n     - \"Under the weather\" (ill).\n     - \"Vice versa\" (opposite order).\n   - **Technical Terms**:\n     - Legal: \"suspended sentence,\" \"custodial sentence,\" \"quashed.\"\n     - Scientific: \"biodiversity,\" \"standard deviation,\" \"synergistic effect.\"\n   - **Word Stress/Syllables**:\n     - Stress patterns (e.g., **DE**crease [noun] vs. de**CREASE** [verb]).\n     - Syllable count (e.g., \"phenomena\" = 4, \"tremendous\" = 3).\n\n#### **4. Phonetics & Pronunciation**\n   - **Syllable Count**:\n     - Breaking words (e.g., \"extract\" = 2, \"tremendous\" = 3).\n   - **Aspiration**:\n     - Identifying aspirated sounds (e.g., /p/ in \"people\" [first syllable]).\n   - **Semi-Vowels**:\n     - Transition sounds (e.g., /y/ in \"the other\").\n   - **Plural Markers**:\n     - Pronunciation of \"-s\" (e.g., \"challenges\" \u2192 [iz]).\n\n#### **5. Communication Skills**\n   - **Telephonic Conversations**:\n     - Formal phrases (e.g., \"How may I help you?\").\n     - Clarification strategies (e.g., \"Your voice is breaking\").\n     - Closing phrases (e.g., \"I will call you back later\").\n   - **Formal vs. Informal Language**:\n     - Avoiding personal tone in formal writing (e.g., \"I do think\" \u2192 problematic in non-quoted text).\n   - **Audience Awareness**:\n     - Recognizing intended readers (e.g., article for UK readers, not India).\n\n#### **6. Syntax & Sentence Construction**\n   - **Parts of Speech**:\n     - Identifying nouns (\"summer\"), adverbs (\"loudly\"), adjectives (\"hot\").\n   - **Sentence Correction**:\n     - Uncountable nouns (e.g., \"furniture\" \u2192 no plural).\n     - Pronoun agreement (e.g., \"everyone has done **their** work\").\n   - **Quotation Integration**:\n     - Rewriting quotes into coherent paragraphs (e.g., combining clauses logically).\n\n---\n\n### **Mermaid Knowledge Graphs**\n#### **1.
