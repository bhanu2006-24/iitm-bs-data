To me, it is an identification problem. If natural sciences set the bar and humanities must measure up to it, there is no way they can meet the standards. Unless we agree to create our own standards, these accusations would never end.

The narratives through which liberal arts courses are shunned are all too familiar. Social sciences never had democratic equality with the natural/biological sciences and technological education. They are dismissed either as questionable or as useless. Modern education is predicated upon science and technology. It has increasingly reduced the space for criticality and reflective variations on the theme of instrumentality, and humanities and social sciences are automatically downgraded. \nIn capitalist societies, education is just another financial sector and the loftier philosophical goals of education \u2013 the pursuance of knowledge and happiness in knowing \u2013 lie discarded. It is significant that the students who pursue humanities do not study for the money. Humanities cannot be made more appealing by tying it to vocational needs. \u201cThat would be sounding the death knell to liberal education,\u201d states Chatterjee. Humanities can flourish when democratic values thrive in society, the spirit of questioning is highly regarded, and liberalism enjoys legitimacy. In other words, if philosophy matters to our lives, humanities is indispensable. \nBut most researchers and students of humanities do not think that any autocratic state would be fundamentally interested in reviving humanities and social sciences since these disciplines encourage critical thinking and questioning of authority structures. The more authoritarian states become, the less tolerant they will be of humanities and social sciences. \nExcerpted from: \nBose, Rakhi. \u201cThe Easy \u2018A\u2019.\u201d Outlook, 11 Jul. 2023, pp. 46-50."

Even the content in liberal arts and humanities courses is considered to be supplementary. Such biases stem from the colonial mindset of \u201cempiricism\u201d as the metric for \u201cgood\u201d or valuable research. Shibashis Chatterjee, a senior professor at the Department of International Relations at Jadavpur University states that the study of humanities and social sciences has been in a state of worldwide crisis for a while now: \u201cSubjects that do not use quantification are labelled as easy.\u201d However, the professor feels that the idea of a competition amongst arts, science and technology is wrong. \u201cThese are complementary fields. To me, it is an identification problem. If natural sciences set the bar and humanities must measure up to it, there is no way they can meet the standards. Unless we agree to create our own standards, these accusations would never end. Hence, we must stop making these comparisons,\u201d he states. \nThe professor of political thought and critical theory also adds that how society looks at knowledge is a political question. \u201cFrom resource allocation to salaries, the logic of instrumentality trumps everything else,\u201d Chatterjee states. The narratives through which liberal arts courses are shunned are all too familiar. Social sciences never had democratic equality with the natural/biological sciences and technological education. They are dismissed either as questionable or as useless. Modern education is predicated upon science and technology. It has increasingly reduced the space for criticality and reflective variations on the theme of instrumentality, and humanities and social sciences are automatically downgraded. \nIn capitalist societies, education is just another financial sector and the loftier philosophical goals of education \u2013 the pursuance of knowledge and happiness in knowing \u2013 lie discarded. It is significant that the students who pursue humanities do not study for the money. Humanities cannot be made more appealing by tying it to vocational needs. \u201cThat would be sounding the death knell to liberal education,\u201d states Chatterjee. Humanities can flourish when democratic values thrive in society, the spirit of questioning is highly regarded, and liberalism enjoys legitimacy. In other words, if philosophy matters to our lives, humanities is indispensable. \nBut most researchers and students of humanities do not think that any autocratic state would be fundamentally interested in reviving humanities and social sciences since these disciplines encourage critical thinking and questioning of authority structures. The more authoritarian states become, the less tolerant they will be of humanities and social sciences. \nExcerpted from: \nBose, Rakhi. \u201cThe Easy \u2018A\u2019.\u201d Outlook, 11 Jul. 2023, pp. 46-50."

The washing machines on all floors have stopped working, but the hostel authorities have not taken any measures to get them repaired despite repeated pleas by the student community.  \nOne of the elevators in the hostel ceased to work a year ago and has not yet been repaired. Consequently, there is overcrowding in the one available elevator, which, in addition to being inconvenient, is a grave safety hazard. Several toilets in the hostel do not have operational flushes. This causes unsanitary living conditions in the hostel and does not aid the cause of the residents\u2019 well-being. \nInedible and possibly hazardous materials such as strands of a steel scrubber, insects and glass shards have lately been found in the mess food. A sickly looking rat was seen scurrying through the mess hall during dinner time. The green moong dal served in the mess in the past two weeks tasted discernibly stale. As evident from these instances, the mess management is unscrupulously lax in the discharge of their duties. \nThe newly admitted students have been accommodated in rooms without almirahs, tables and chairs. Even after the newly ordered furniture reached the hostel, no provisions were made for its being shifted to the rooms in need. \nI kindly request you to address these pressing concerns with the hostel management and enable their hasty redressal.  \nYours sincerely, [Sign] XYZ General Secretary  Ph: 1234567890",

The washing machines on all floors have stopped working, but the hostel authorities have not taken any measures to get them repaired despite repeated pleas by the student community.  \nOne of the elevators in the hostel ceased to work a year ago and has not yet been repaired. Consequently, there is overcrowding in the one available elevator, which, in addition to being inconvenient, is a grave safety hazard. Several toilets in the hostel do not have operational flushes. This causes unsanitary living conditions in the hostel and does not aid the cause of the residents\u2019 well-being. \nInedible and possibly hazardous materials such as strands of a steel scrubber, insects and glass shards have lately been found in the mess food. A sickly looking rat was seen scurrying through the mess hall during dinner time. The green moong dal served in the mess in the past two weeks tasted discernibly stale. As evident from these instances, the mess management is unscrupulously lax in the discharge of their duties. \nThe newly admitted students have been accommodated in rooms without almirahs, tables and chairs. Even after the newly ordered furniture reached the hostel, no provisions were made for its being shifted to the rooms in need. \nI kindly request you to address these pressing concerns with the hostel management and enable their hasty redressal.  \nYours sincerely, [Sign] XYZ General Secretary  Ph: 1234567890",

The washing machines on all floors have stopped working, but the hostel authorities have not taken any measures to get them repaired despite repeated pleas by the student community.  \nOne of the elevators in the hostel ceased to work a year ago and has not yet been repaired. Consequently, there is overcrowding in the one available elevator, which, in addition to being inconvenient, is a grave safety hazard. Several toilets in the hostel do not have operational flushes. This causes unsanitary living conditions in the hostel and does not aid the cause of the residents\u2019 well-being. \nInedible and possibly hazardous materials such as strands of a steel scrubber, insects and glass shards have lately been found in the mess food. A sickly looking rat was seen scurrying through the mess hall during dinner time. The green moong dal served in the mess in the past two weeks tasted discernibly stale. As evident from these instances, the mess management is unscrupulously lax in the discharge of their duties. \nThe newly admitted students have been accommodated in rooms without almirahs, tables and chairs. Even after the newly ordered furniture reached the hostel, no provisions were made for its being shifted to the rooms in need. \nI kindly request you to address these pressing concerns with the hostel management and enable their hasty redressal.  \nYours sincerely, [Sign] XYZ General Secretary  Ph: 1234567890"

The washing machines on all floors have stopped working, but the hostel authorities have not taken any measures to get them repaired despite repeated pleas by the student community.  \nOne of the elevators in the hostel ceased to work a year ago and has not yet been repaired. Consequently, there is overcrowding in the one available elevator, which, in addition to being inconvenient, is a grave safety hazard. Several toilets in the hostel do not have operational flushes. This causes unsanitary living conditions in the hostel and does not aid the cause of the residents\u2019 well-being. \nInedible and possibly hazardous materials such as strands of a steel scrubber, insects and glass shards have lately been found in the mess food. A sickly looking rat was seen scurrying through the mess hall during dinner time. The green moong dal served in the mess in the past two weeks tasted discernibly stale. As evident from these instances, the mess management is unscrupulously lax in the discharge of their duties. \nThe newly admitted students have been accommodated in rooms without almirahs, tables and chairs. Even after the newly ordered furniture reached the hostel, no provisions were made for its being shifted to the rooms in need. \nI kindly request you to address these pressing concerns with the hostel management and enable their hasty redressal.  \nYours sincerely, [Sign] XYZ General Secretary  Ph: 1234567890",

        "summary": "Here\u2019s a structured **summary of core topics, concepts, and principles** for the **\"Foundation Level: English I (Computer-Based Exam)\"** based on the provided question paper.\nThe exam focuses on **reading comprehension, grammar, vocabulary, formal writing, and linguistic analysis**. Below is a breakdown of key areas:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Reading Comprehension**\n#### **Core Topics:**\n- **Passage Analysis**:\n  - Identifying **main ideas**, **supporting details**, and **inferences**.\n  - Understanding **author\u2019s tone, purpose, and perspective**.\n  - Recognizing **bias, assumptions, and political/social implications** in texts.\n  - Matching **adjectives to nouns** based on contextual usage (e.g., \"colonial mindset,\" \"liberal education\").\n\n- **Vocabulary in Context**:\n  - Synonyms/antonyms (e.g., \"appendage\" \u2260 \"approbation\"; \"indispensable\" = absolutely necessary).\n  - Comparative/superlative forms (e.g., \"loftier\" \u2192 \"lofty\").\n  - **Plural/singular nouns** (e.g., \"biases\" is plural).\n  - **Idioms/phrases** (e.g., \"out of my league,\" \"in the clear\").\n\n- **Critical Thinking**:\n  - Evaluating **arguments** (e.g., why humanities are undervalued in authoritarian societies).\n  - Identifying **cause-effect relationships** (e.g., capitalist education \u2192 instrumental logic).\n\n#### **Key Passages Analyzed**:\n- **\"The Easy \u2018A\u2019\"** (Outlook article):\n  - **Central Argument**: Humanities/social sciences are undervalued due to **colonial empiricism**, **capitalist instrumentality**, and **authoritarian intolerance**.\n  - **Key Quotes**:\n    - \"Subjects that do not use quantification are labelled as easy.\"\n    - \"Humanities can flourish when democratic values thrive.\"\n    - \"Modern education is predicated upon science and technology.\"\n\n---\n\n### **2. Grammar**\n#### **Core Topics**:\n- **Subject-Verb Agreement**:\n  - Singular/plural subjects (e.g., \"None of the chairs **needs** repair\").\n  - Collective nouns (e.g., \"All of the hard drives **are** in this box\").\n\n- **Tenses**:\n  - **Present Perfect Continuous**: \"I **have been studying** Biology for three hours.\"\n  - **Future Perfect Continuous**: \"She **will have been driving** for an hour by the time she gets to the office.\"\n  - **Past Simple vs. Present Continuous**:\n    - Correct: \"Their **understanding** of the problem was incorrect.\"\n    - Incorrect: \"They **are understanding** the problem.\" (Stative verbs like \"understand\" are not used in continuous tenses.)\n\n- **Prepositions**:\n  - \"Good **at** swimming\" (not \"in/for/on\").\n  - \"Sitting **on** a bench.\"\n\n- **Articles**:\n  - \"An hour\" (because \"hour\" starts with a **vowel sound** /a\u028a\u0259r/).\n\n- **Modals**:\n  - **Strong warning**: \"That **will** teach you to be respectful!\" (not \"can/shall/may\").\n\n- **Phrasal Verbs**:\n  - \"The king\u2019s army **held off** the aggressors\" (repelled/delayed).\n\n#### **Common Errors to Avoid**:\n- Misusing **stative verbs** in continuous tenses (e.g., \"I am knowing\" \u2192 \"I know\").\n- Incorrect **prepositions** (e.g., \"good in swimming\" \u2192 \"good at swimming\").\n- **Subject-verb disagreement** with indefinite pronouns (e.g., \"None of the chairs **need**\" \u2192 \"needs\").\n\n---\n\n### **3. Formal Writing (Letters)**\n#### **Core Topics**:\n- **Structure of a Formal Letter**:\n  1. **Sender\u2019s Address** (e.g., \"The General Secretary, Narmada Hostel\").\n  2. **Date**.\n  3. **Recipient\u2019s Address** (e.g., \"The Dean, Hostel Affairs\").\n  4. **Subject Line** (e.g., \"Unavailability of Necessary Facilities in Narmada Hostel\").\n  5. **Salutation** (e.g., \"Respected Sir,\").\n  6. **Body**:\n     - **Topic sentence** (e.g., \"I am writing to draw your attention to lacking facilities\").\n     - **Supporting details** (e.g., broken elevators, unsanitary mess food).\n     - **Transitional phrases** (e.g., \"Consequently,\" \"As evident from these instances\").\n  7. **Closing** (e.g., \"Yours sincerely,\").\n  8. **Signature and Name**.\n\n- **Purpose**:\n  - **Complaint letters**: List issues **clearly** to justify urgency (e.g., safety hazards, health risks).\n  - **Politeness**: Use **formal language** (e.g., \"I kindly request\" instead of \"Fix this now!\").\n\n- **Argumentative Strategies**:\n  - **Examples** (most common in the hostel letter).\n  - **Transitional devices** (e.g., \"Consequently,\" \"As evident from...\").\n\n#### **Key Examples**:\n- **Hostel Complaint Letter**:\n  - Issues: Broken washing machines, elevators, unsanitary toilets, contaminated food.\n  - **Urgency**: \"Grave safety hazard,\" \"hazardous materials.\"\n  - **Request**: \"Enable their **hasty redressal**.\"\n\n---\n\n### **4. Vocabulary and Word Usage**\n#### **Core Topics**:\n- **Synonyms/Antonyms**:\n  | Word          | Synonym               | Antonym               |\n  |---------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n  | Appendage     | Addition/Accessory     | Core                  |\n  | Indispensable | Essential              | Dispensable           |\n  | Lofty         | Elevated/Noble         | Low/Humble            |\n  | Lax           | Lenient/Negligent      | Strict/Diligent       |\n\n- **Idioms/Phrases**:\n  | Phrase               | Meaning                                  |\n  |----------------------|------------------------------------------|\n  | Out of my league      | Too good for someone                     |\n  | In the clear          | Not guilty                               |\n  | Hold off              | Repel/delay                              |\n  | Death knell           | Signal of impending failure              |\n\n- **Word Stress**:\n  - **Noun vs. Verb Stress**:\n    - **Decrease** (noun: **DE**crease) vs. de**crease** (verb: de**CREASE**).\n  - **Compound Words**: \"Football\" (stress on **first syllable**: **FOOT**ball).\n\n- **Syllables**:\n  - \"Compensation\" = **4 syllables** (com-pen-sa-tion).\n\n- **Consonant Clusters**:\n  - \"Against\" = **final CCC** (/\u0261\u025bnst/).\n\n- **Semi-Vowels**:\n  - Transition between \"he\" and \"arrived\" in \"He arrived\" = **/y/** (as in \"yes\").\n\n---\n\n### **5. Linguistics**\n#### **Core Topics**:\n- **Phonetics**:\n  - **Aspiration**: The /p/ in \"**people**\" is aspirated in the **first syllable** (/\u02c8pi\u02d0p\u0259l/).\n  - **Semi-vowels**: /w/ (as in \"we\") and /y/ (as in \"yes\").\n  - **Syllable Counting**: Break words into vowel sounds (e.g., \"com-pen-sa-tion\" = 4).\n\n- **Parts of Speech**:\n  - \"Err\" in \"To err is human\" = **verb**.\n  - \"Mountain\" = **concrete noun** (vs. abstract nouns like \"love\").\n\n- **Adverbs**:\n  - **Adverb of place**: \"They moved **abroad**.\"\n\n---\n\n### **6. Telephonic Conversations**\n#### **Core Topics**:\n- **Politeness**:\n  - **Formal requests**: \"I would like to schedule an appointment for 10:30 AM.\"\n  - **Avoid slang**: \"I wanna see the doctor\" \u2192 \"I would like to book an appointment.\"\n- **Clarity**:\n  - Repeat politely if unclear: \"I\u2019m sorry, your voice is breaking.

Key Equations/Rules (For Grammar and Linguistics)**\nWhile this exam doesn\u2019t involve mathematical equations, here are **critical grammatical \"rules\"** presented in a structured format:\n\n1. **Subject-Verb Agreement**:\n   - Singular subject + **s/es** (e.g., \"She **runs**\").\n   - Plural subject + **base verb** (e.g., \"They **run**\").\n   - Indefinite pronouns (**none, some, all**):\n     - \"None\" can be singular/plural; default to **singular** in formal contexts (e.g., \"None **is** correct\").\n\n2. **Article Usage**:\n   - **A** before consonant **sounds** (e.g., \"a cat\").\n   - **An** before vowel **sounds** (e.g., \"an hour\" /a\u028a\u0259r/).\n\n3. **Tense Formulas**:\n   - **Present Perfect Continuous**: **Subject + have/has been + verb-ing**\n     (e.g., \"I have been studying\").\n   - **Future Perfect Continuous**: **Subject + will have been + verb-ing**\n     (e.g., \"She will have been driving\").\n\n4. **Preposition Rules**:\n   - **Good at** (skills): \"She is good **at** swimming.\"\n   - **Interested in**: \"He is interested **in** science.\"\n\n5. **Syllable Stress**:\n   - **Noun-Verb Pairs**:\n     - Noun: Stress on **first syllable** (e.g., **RE**cord).\n     - Verb: Stress on **second syllable** (e.g., re**CORD**).\n\n6. **Pluralization**:\n   - **Regular**: Add **-s** (e.g., \"book \u2192 books\").\n   - **Irregular**: Change spelling (e.g., \"child \u2192 children\").\n   - **\"Biases\"** is the plural of \"bias.\"\n\n---\n\n### **9. Exam Tips**\n1. **Reading Comprehension**:\n   - **Skimming**: Read the passage first to grasp the main idea.\n   - **Scanning**: Look for keywords in questions (e.g., \"colonial mindset,\" \"authoritarian states\").\n   - **Eliminate wrong options**: Cross out clearly incorrect choices.\n\n2. **Grammar**:\n   - **Subject-verb agreement**: Always check if the subject is singular/plural.\n   - **Tenses**: Watch for time indicators (e.g., \"since last month\" \u2192 present perfect).\n\n3. **Formal Writing**:\n   - **Tone**: Avoid contractions (\"don\u2019t\" \u2192 \"do not\") and slang.\n   - **Structure**: Follow the **8-part formal letter format**.\n\n4. **Vocabulary**:\n   - **Context clues**: Use surrounding sentences to infer meanings.\n   - **Root words**: Break down complex words (e.g., \"indispensable\" = in- (not) + dispensable (able to be dismissed)).\n\n5. **Linguistics**:\n   - **Phonetics**: Practice pronouncing words to identify stressed syllables.\n   - **Parts of speech**: Memorize common suffixes (e.g., \"-tion\" = noun).\n\n6. **Time Management**:\n   - Spend **~1 minute per question** for multiple-choice.\n   - Allocate **5-7 minutes** for passage-based questions.",
