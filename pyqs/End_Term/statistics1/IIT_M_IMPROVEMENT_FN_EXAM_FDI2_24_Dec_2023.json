Probability Distributions**\n#### **Discrete Distributions**\n- **Bernoulli Distribution**:\n  - Models a single trial with two outcomes (success/failure).\n  - **PMF**: \\( P(X = k) = p^k (1-p)^{1-k} \\), where \\( k \\in \\{0,1\\} \\).\n  - **Mean**: \\( E[X] = p \\).\n  - **Variance**: \\( \\text{Var}(X) = p(1-p) \\).\n\n- **Binomial Distribution**:\n  - Models \\( n \\) independent Bernoulli trials.\n  - **PMF**: \\( P(X = k) = \\binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k} \\), where \\( k = 0,1,...,n \\).\n  - **Mean**: \\( E[X] = np \\).\n  - **Variance**: \\( \\text{Var}(X) = np(1-p) \\).\n  - **Example**: Q2, Q14 (given \\( E[X] = 2 \\), \\( \\text{Var}(X) = 1.5 \\), solve for \\( n \\) and \\( p \\)).\n\n- **Poisson Distribution**:\n  - Models count of rare events in fixed intervals.\n  - **PMF**: \\( P(X = k) = \\frac{e^{-\\lambda} \\lambda^k}{k!} \\).\n  - **Mean/Variance**: \\( E[X] = \\text{Var}(X) = \\lambda \\).\n  - **Additivity**: If \\( X \\sim \\text{Poisson}(\\lambda_1) \\), \\( Y \\sim \\text{Poisson}(\\lambda_2) \\), then \\( X+Y \\sim \\text{Poisson}(\\lambda_1 + \\lambda_2) \\).\n  - **Example**: Q16 (variance of \\( 2X + Y \\) where \\( X \\sim \\text{Poisson}(3) \\), \\( Y \\sim \\text{Poisson}(5) \\)).\n\n#### **Continuous Distributions**\n- **Uniform Distribution**:\n  - **PDF**: \\( f(x) = \\frac{1}{b-a} \\) for \\( x \\in [a,b] \\).\n  - **Mean**: \\( E[X] = \\frac{a+b}{2} \\).\n  - **Variance**: \\( \\text{Var}(X) = \\frac{(b-a)^2}{12} \\).\n  - **Example**: Q12 (find \\( b \\) given \\( E[X] = 120 \\), \\( a = 100 \\)).\n\n- **Exponential Distribution**:\n  - Models time between events in a Poisson process.\n  - **PDF**: \\( f(x) = \\lambda e^{-\\lambda x} \\).\n  - **CDF**: \\( F(x) = 1 - e^{-\\lambda x} \\).\n  - **Mean**: \\( E[X] = \\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\).\n  - **Variance**: \\( \\text{Var}(X) = \\frac{1}{\\lambda^2} \\).\n  - **Memoryless Property**: \\( P(X > s + t | X > s) = P(X > t) \\).\n  - **Example**: Q10 (waiting time > 15 mins, \\( \\lambda = 1/4 \\)).\n\n#### **Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)**\n- **Definition**: \\( F_X(x) = P(X \\leq x) \\).\n- **Properties**:\n  - \\( 0 \\leq F_X(x) \\leq 1 \\).\n  - Right-continuous.\n  - \\( P(a < X \\leq b) = F_X(b) - F_X(a) \\).\n- **Discrete Case**: \\( P(X = k) = F_X(k) - F_X(k^-) \\).\n- **Example**: Q4, Q5 (extract probabilities from CDF graph).\n\n---\n### **2. Conditional Probability & Bayes\u2019 Theorem**\n- **Conditional Probability**: \\( P(A|B) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)} \\).\n- **Bayes\u2019 Theorem**:\n  \\( P(A|B) = \\frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} \\).\n- **Law of Total Probability**:\n  \\( P(B) = \\sum P(B|A_i)P(A_i) \\).\n- **Example**:\n  - Q6 (probability of selecting a biased/fair coin and getting heads).\n  - Q7 (posterior probability that the coin is fair given it landed heads).\n\n---\n### **3. Expectation & Variance**\n- **Linearity of Expectation**:\n  \\( E[aX + bY] = aE[X] + bE[Y] \\).\n- **Variance Properties**:\n  \\( \\text{Var}(aX + b) = a^2 \\text{Var}(X) \\).\n  For independent \\( X \\) and \\( Y \\):\n  \\( \\text{Var}(X + Y) = \\text{Var}(X) + \\text{Var}(Y) \\).\n- **Example**:\n  - Q8 (\\( E[X + Y] \\) where \\( X + Y = 2 \\) always).\n  - Q16 (\\( \\text{Var}(2X + Y) = 4\\text{Var}(X) + \\text{Var}(Y) = 12 + 5 = 17 \\)).\n\n---\n### **4. Percentiles & Data Scaling**\n- **Percentile**: Value below which \\( p\\% \\) of observations fall.\n- **Effect of Linear Transformations**:\n  - Adding a constant shifts percentiles by that constant.\n  - Multiplying by a constant scales percentiles by that constant.\n- **Example**: Q9 (adding 2 to all observations shifts percentiles by +2).\n\n---\n### **5. Measurement Scales**\n- **Nominal**: Categories with no order (e.g., colors).\n- **Ordinal**: Categories with order but no fixed intervals (e.g., survey ratings).\n- **Interval**: Ordered with fixed intervals but no true zero (e.g., temperature in \u00b0C).\n- **Ratio**: Interval scale with a true zero (e.g., weight, height).\n- **Example**: Q13 (identify correct statements about scales).\n\n---\n### **6. Hypergeometric Distribution**\n- Models draws without replacement from a finite population.\n- **PMF**:\n  \\( P(X = k) = \\frac{\\binom{K}{k} \\binom{N-K}{n-k}}{\\binom{N}{n}} \\),\n  where \\( N \\) = total items, \\( K \\) = success items, \\( n \\) = draws.\n- **Example**: Q15 (drawing milk chocolates from an urn).\n\n---\n### **7. Geometric Distribution**\n- Models the number of trials until the first success.\n- **PMF**: \\( P(X = k) = (1-p)^{k-1} p \\).\n- **Memoryless Property**: \\( P(X > s + t | X > s) = P(X > t) \\).\n- **Example**: Q11 (probability of ending in 3 tosses: \\( P(\\text{HTT or THT}) = 2 \\times (0.5)^3 = 0.25 \\)).\n\n---\n\n## **Key Equations**\n| **Concept**               | **Equation**                                                                 |\n|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Binomial PMF              | \\( P(X=k) = \\binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k} \\)                                 |\n| Poisson PMF               | \\( P(X=k) = \\frac{e^{-\\lambda} \\lambda^k}{k!} \\)                           |\n| Exponential CDF           | \\( F(x) = 1 - e^{-\\lambda x} \\)                                             |\n| Uniform Mean              | \\( E[X] = \\frac{a+b}{2} \\)                                                  |\n| Bayes\u2019 Theorem            | \\( P(A|B) = \\frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} \\)                                      |\n| Variance of Linear Combo  | \\( \\text{Var}(aX + bY) = a^2 \\text{Var}(X) + b^2 \\text{Var}(Y) \\) (if independent) |\n| Hypergeometric PMF        | \\( P(X=k) = \\frac{\\binom{K}{k} \\binom{N-K}{n-k}}{\\binom{N}{n}} \\)          |\n| Conditional Probability   | \\( P(A|B) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)} \\)                                      |\n\n---\n\n## **Mermaid Knowledge Graphs**\n### **Graph 1: Probability Distributions**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Probability Distributions] --> B[Discrete]\n    A --> C[Continuous]\n    B --> D[Bernoulli]\n    B --> E[Binomial]\n    B --> F[Poisson]\n    B --> G[Hypergeometric]\n    C --> H[Uniform]\n    C --> I[Exponential]\n    E --> J[\"PMF: n choose k * p^k (1-p)^n-k\"]\n    F --> K[\"PMF: e^-\u03bb \u03bb^k / k!\"]\n    I --> L[\"CDF: 1 - e^-\u03bbx\"]\n```\n\n### **Graph 2: Conditional Probability & Bayes**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Conditional Probability] --> B[\"P(A|B) = P(A \u2229 B)/P(B)\"]\n    A --> C[Bayes' Theorem]\n    C --> D[\"P(A|B) = P(B|A)P(A)/P(B)\"]\n    A --> E[Law of Total Probability]\n    E --> F[\"P(B) = \u03a3 P(B|A_i)P(A_i)\"]\n```\n\n### **Graph 3: Expectation & Variance**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Expectation] --> B[Linearity: E[aX + bY] = aE[X] + bE[Y]]\n    A --> C[Binomial: E[X] = np]\n    C --> D[\"Var(X) = np(1-p)\"]\n    A --> E[Poisson: E[X] = Var(X) = \u03bb]\n    F[Variance] --> G[\"Var(aX + b) = a\u00b2Var(X)\"]\n    F --> H[\"Independent X,Y: Var(X+Y) = Var(X) + Var(Y)\"]\n```\n\n### **Graph 4: Data Scales & Percentiles**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Measurement Scales] --> B[Nominal]\n    A --> C[Ordinal]\n    A --> D[Interval]\n    A --> E[Ratio]\n    B --> F[Labels, No Order]\n    C --> G[Order, No Fixed Intervals]\n    D --> H[Fixed Intervals, No True Zero]\n    E --> I[True Zero, Ratios Meaningful]\n    J[Percentiles] --> K[\"Shifted by +c if data += c\"]\n    J --> L[\"Scaled by *c if data *= c\"]\n```\n\n---\n## **Exam Strategy**\n1. **Binomial/Poisson**: Memorize PMF, mean, and variance formulas.\n2. **CDF Graphs**: Practice extracting \\( P(X = k) \\) and conditional probabilities.\n3. **Bayes\u2019 Theorem**: Use tables or trees for complex problems (e.g., coin selection).\n4. **Exponential/Uniform**: Focus on CDF and memoryless properties.\n5. **Variance**: Remember linearity **does not apply** to variance (use \\( a^2 \\) rule).\n6. **Percentiles**: Adding a constant shifts percentiles by that constant.",
