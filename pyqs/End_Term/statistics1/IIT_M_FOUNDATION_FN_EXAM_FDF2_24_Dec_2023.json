Measurement Scales (Data Types)**\n   - **Nominal Scale**:\n     - Categories with no order (e.g., labels like \"red,\" \"blue\").\n   - **Ordinal Scale**:\n     - Categories with order but no meaningful differences (e.g., \"low,\" \"medium,\" \"high\").\n   - **Interval Scale**:\n     - Ordered with meaningful differences but no true zero (e.g., temperature in Celsius).\n   - **Ratio Scale**:\n     - Ordered with meaningful differences and a true zero (e.g., weight, height).\n   - **Example**: Q13 (identifying correct statements about scales).\n\n#### **6. Hypergeometric Distribution**\n   - **Definition**: Models successes in draws **without replacement** from a finite population.\n   - **PMF**: \\( P(X = k) = \\frac{\\binom{K}{k} \\binom{N-K}{n-k}}{\\binom{N}{n}} \\),\n     where \\( N \\) = total items, \\( K \\) = success items, \\( n \\) = draws.\n   - **Example**: Q15 (drawing milk chocolates from an urn).\n\n#### **7. Geometric Distribution**\n   - **Definition**: Models the number of trials until the first success.\n   - **PMF**: \\( P(X = k) = (1-p)^{k-1} p \\).\n   - **Memoryless Property**: \\( P(X > s + t | X > s) = P(X > t) \\).\n   - **Example**: Q11 (probability of ending experiment in 3 tosses).\n\n---\n\n### **Key Equations**\n| **Topic**               | **Equation**                                                                 |\n|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Binomial PMF            | \\( P(X = k) = \\binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k} \\)                              |\n| Poisson PMF             | \\( P(X = k) = \\frac{e^{-\\lambda} \\lambda^k}{k!} \\)                         |\n| Exponential PDF/CDF     | \\( f(x) = \\lambda e^{-\\lambda x} \\), \\( F(x) = 1 - e^{-\\lambda x} \\)      |\n| Uniform PDF             | \\( f(x) = \\frac{1}{b-a} \\), \\( a \\leq x \\leq b \\)                         |\n| Bayes\u2019 Theorem          | \\( P(A | B) = \\frac{P(B | A) P(A)}{P(B)} \\)                               |\n| Expectation (Discrete)  | \\( E[X] = \\sum_x x P(X = x) \\)                                             |\n| Variance                | \\( \\text{Var}(X) = E[X^2] - (E[X])^2 \\)                                    |\n| Variance of Linear Comb.| \\( \\text{Var}(aX + bY) = a^2 \\text{Var}(X) + b^2 \\text{Var}(Y) \\) (ind.)  |\n| Hypergeometric PMF      | \\( P(X = k) = \\frac{\\binom{K}{k} \\binom{N-K}{n-k}}{\\binom{N}{n}} \\)       |\n| Conditional Probability | \\( P(A | B) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)} \\)                                  |\n\n---\n\n### **Mermaid Knowledge Graphs**\n#### **Graph 1: Probability Distributions**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Probability Distributions] --> B[Discrete]\n    A --> C[Continuous]\n    B --> D[Binomial]\n    B --> E[Poisson]\n    B --> F[Bernoulli]\n    B --> G[Hypergeometric]\n    B --> H[Geometric]\n    C --> I[Exponential]\n    C --> J[Uniform]\n    D --> K[\"PMF: nCk p^k (1-p)^n-k\"]\n    D --> L[\"Mean: np\"]\n    D --> M[\"Variance: np(1-p)\"]\n    E --> N[\"PMF: e^-\u03bb \u03bb^k / k!\"]\n    E --> O[\"Mean/Variance: \u03bb\"]\n    I --> P[\"PDF: \u03bbe^-\u03bbx\"]\n    I --> Q[\"CDF: 1 - e^-\u03bbx\"]\n    I --> R[\"Mean: 1/\u03bb\"]\n```\n\n#### **Graph 2: Conditional Probability & Bayes\u2019 Theorem**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Conditional Probability] --> B[\"P(A|B) = P(A \u2229 B) / P(B)\"]\n    A --> C[Bayes' Theorem]\n    C --> D[\"P(A|B) = P(B|A)P(A) / P(B)\"]\n    A --> E[Law of Total Probability]\n    E --> F[\"P(B) = \u03a3 P(B|A_i)P(A_i)\"]\n    A --> G[Example: Coin Selection Problem]\n    G --> H[\"Fair Coin (P(H)=0.5)\"]\n    G --> I[\"Biased Coin (P(H)=0.75)\"]\n```\n\n#### **Graph 3: Expectation & Variance**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Expectation] --> B[\"E[X] = \u03a3 x P(X=x) (Discrete)\"]\n    A --> C[\"E[X] = \u222b x f(x) dx (Continuous)\"]\n    A --> D[Linearity]\n    D --> E[\"E[aX + bY] = aE[X] + bE[Y]\"]\n    F[Variance] --> G[\"Var(X) = E[X^2] - (E[X])^2\"]\n    F --> H[\"Var(aX + bY) = a\u00b2Var(X) + b\u00b2Var(Y) (Independent)\"]\n    F --> I[Example: Poisson Variance]\n    I --> J[\"Var(2X + Y) = 4Var(X) + Var(Y)\"]\n```\n\n#### **Graph 4: Data Measurement Scales**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Measurement Scales] --> B[Nominal]\n    B --> C[\"Labels, No Order\"]\n    A --> D[Ordinal]\n    D --> E[\"Order, No Meaningful Differences\"]\n    A --> F[Interval]\n    F --> G[\"Order + Differences, No True Zero\"]\n    A --> H[Ratio]\n    H --> I[\"Order + Differences + True Zero\"]\n```\n\n#### **Graph 5: Relationships Between Key Concepts**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Random Variable X] --> B[Distribution]\n    B --> C[Binomial]\n    B --> D[Poisson]\n    B --> E[Exponential]\n    A --> F[Expectation/Variance]\n    F --> G[\"E[X], Var(X)\"]\n    A --> H[Conditional Probability]\n    H --> I[\"P(X|Y), Bayes' Theorem\"]\n    A --> J[CDF/PMF]\n    J --> K[\"P(X \u2264 x), P(X = x)\"]\n    K --> L[Example: CDF to PMF]\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Exam-Specific Tips**\n1. **Binomial vs. Bernoulli**:\n   - Bernoulli is a single trial; Binomial is \\( n \\) independent Bernoulli trials.\n   - Q2: \\( X \\sim \\text{Binomial}(5, 0.6) \\) (not Bernoulli).\n\n2. **CDF to PMF**:\n   - For discrete \\( X \\), \\( P(X = x) = F_X(x) - F_X(x^-) \\).\n   - Q4, Q5: Read values from CDF plots carefully (e.g., \\( P(X = 0) = F_X(0) \\)).\n\n3. **Bayes\u2019 Theorem**:\n   - Q6, Q7: Use law of total probability to find \\( P(\\text{Head}) \\), then apply Bayes\u2019 to find \\( P(\\text{Fair | Head}) \\).\n\n4. **Exponential Distribution**:\n   - Q10: \\( P(X > 15) = e^{-\\lambda \\times 15} \\), where \\( \\lambda = 1/\\text{mean} = 1/4 \\).\n\n5. **Uniform Distribution**:\n   - Q12: \\( E[X] = (100 + b)/2 = 120 \\) \u2192 Solve for \\( b \\).\n\n6. **Percentiles**:\n   - Q9: Adding a constant shifts percentiles by that constant.
