Probability Basics**\n- **Definitions**:\n  - Sample space, events, mutually exclusive/exhaustive events.\n  - Conditional probability: \\( P(A|B) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)} \\).\n  - Independence: \\( P(A \\cap B) = P(A)P(B) \\).\n- **Rules**:\n  - Addition: \\( P(A \\cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \\cap B) \\).\n  - Complement: \\( P(A^c) = 1 - P(A) \\).\n- **Example Problems**:\n  - Probability of \"at most one\" success in binomial trials (Q2).\n  - Probability of union of events (Q13: \\( P(A \\cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \\cap B) \\)).\n\n#### **2. Combinatorics**\n- **Counting Principles**:\n  - Permutations (order matters): \\( P(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{(n-k)!} \\).\n  - Combinations (order doesn\u2019t matter): \\( C(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \\).\n- **Applications**:\n  - Selecting items with/without replacement (Q3, Q4, Q9).\n  - Probability using combinations (e.g., hypergeometric distribution in Q4).\n\n#### **3. Random Variables & Distributions**\n- **Discrete Random Variables (RVs)**:\n  - **Probability Mass Function (PMF)**: \\( P(X = x) \\).\n  - **Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)**: \\( F_X(x) = P(X \\leq x) \\).\n  - **Expected Value**: \\( E[X] = \\sum x P(X = x) \\).\n  - **Variance**: \\( \\text{Var}(X) = E[X^2] - (E[X])^2 \\).\n  - **Example Distributions**:\n    - **Binomial**: \\( X \\sim \\text{Binomial}(n, p) \\), \\( P(X = k) = C(n, k) p^k (1-p)^{n-k} \\).\n    - **Poisson**: \\( X \\sim \\text{Poisson}(\\lambda) \\), \\( P(X = k) = \\frac{e^{-\\lambda} \\lambda^k}{k!} \\).\n      - Properties: \\( E[X] = \\text{Var}(X) = \\lambda \\).\n      - Linear combination: If \\( X, Y \\) are independent Poisson, \\( aX + bY \\sim \\text{Poisson}(a\\lambda_X + b\\lambda_Y) \\).\n      - **Variance of linear combination**: \\( \\text{Var}(aX + bY) = a^2 \\text{Var}(X) + b^2 \\text{Var}(Y) \\) (Q5).\n- **Continuous Random Variables**:\n  - **Probability Density Function (PDF)**: \\( f_X(x) \\).\n  - **CDF**: \\( F_X(x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^x f_X(t) dt \\).\n  - **Uniform Distribution**: \\( X \\sim \\text{Uniform}(a, b) \\), \\( f_X(x) = \\frac{1}{b-a} \\).\n    - \\( E[X] = \\frac{a+b}{2} \\), \\( \\text{Var}(X) = \\frac{(b-a)^2}{12} \\).\n    - Conditional probability (Q12: \\( P(X > 140 | X > 130) = \\frac{150-140}{150-130} = 0.5 \\)).\n\n#### **4. Statistical Measures**\n- **Scales of Measurement** (Q6):\n  - **Nominal**: Categories (e.g., vehicle number plates).\n  - **Ordinal**: Ordered categories (e.g., rankings).\n  - **Interval**: Ordered with equal intervals (no true zero, e.g., temperature).\n  - **Ratio**: Interval + true zero (e.g., life of a bulb in hours).\n- **Mode**: Most frequent value (Q8).\n\n#### **5. Conditional Probability & Independence**\n- **Key Formulas**:\n  - \\( P(A|B) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)} \\).\n  - Bayes\u2019 Theorem: \\( P(A|B) = \\frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} \\).\n- **Applications**:\n  - Probability of no issues (Q14: \\( P(\\text{no software or battery issue}) = 1 - P(A \\cup B) \\)).\n  - CDF to PMF (Q15: \\( P(X = 1) = F_X(1) - F_X(0) \\)).\n\n#### **6. Expected Value & Variance**\n- **Linear Properties**:\n  - \\( E[aX + bY] = aE[X] + bE[Y] \\).\n  - \\( \\text{Var}(aX + bY) = a^2 \\text{Var}(X) + b^2 \\text{Var}(Y) + 2ab \\text{Cov}(X, Y) \\).\n    - If independent: \\( \\text{Cov}(X, Y) = 0 \\).\n- **Example**:\n  - Poisson RV variance (Q5: \\( \\text{Var}(2X - Y) = 4 \\text{Var}(X) + \\text{Var}(Y) = 4(2) + 2 = 10 \\)).\n\n#### **7. Uniform Distribution**\n- **PDF/CDF**:\n  - \\( f_X(x) = \\frac{1}{b-a} \\) for \\( a \\leq x \\leq b \\).\n  - \\( F_X(x) = \\frac{x-a}{b-a} \\).\n- **Expected Value**:\n  - \\( E[X] = \\frac{a+b}{2} \\) (Q11: \\( 130 = \\frac{a + 150}{2} \\Rightarrow a = 110 \\)).\n\n---\n\n### **Key Equations**\n| **Topic**               | **Equation**                                                                 |\n|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Binomial PMF**        | \\( P(X = k) = C(n, k) p^k (1-p)^{n-k} \\)                                   |\n| **Poisson PMF**         | \\( P(X = k) = \\frac{e^{-\\lambda} \\lambda^k}{k!} \\)                          |\n| **Uniform CDF**         | \\( F_X(x) = \\frac{x-a}{b-a} \\)                                              |\n| **Expected Value**      | \\( E[X] = \\sum x P(X = x) \\) (discrete) or \\( \\int x f_X(x) dx \\) (continuous) |\n| **Variance**            | \\( \\text{Var}(X) = E[X^2] - (E[X])^2 \\)                                    |\n| **Conditional Probability** | \\( P(A|B) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)} \\)                                    |\n| **Addition Rule**       | \\( P(A \\cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \\cap B) \\)                              |\n| **Combinations**        | \\( C(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \\)                                        |\n\n---\n\n### **Mermaid Knowledge Graphs**\n#### **Graph 1: Probability & Combinatorics**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Probability Basics] --> B[Sample Space & Events]\n    A --> C[Conditional Probability]\n    A --> D[Independence]\n    C --> E[Bayes' Theorem]\n    B --> F[Addition Rule]\n    B --> G[Complement Rule]\n    A --> H[Combinatorics]\n    H --> I[Permutations]\n    H --> J[Combinations]\n    J --> K[Binomial Coefficients]\n```\n\n#### **Graph 2: Random Variables & Distributions**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    L[Random Variables] --> M[Discrete RV]\n    L --> N[Continuous RV]\n    M --> O[PMF]\n    M --> P[CDF]\n    M --> Q[Expected Value]\n    M --> R[Variance]\n    O --> S[Binomial Distribution]\n    O --> T[Poisson Distribution]\n    N --> U[PDF]\n    N --> V[Uniform Distribution]\n    V --> W[Expected Value: (a+b)/2]\n    V --> X[Variance: (b-a)\u00b2/12]\n```\n\n#### **Graph 3: Statistical Measures & Scales**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    Y[Statistical Measures] --> Z[Scales of Measurement]\n    Z --> AA[Nominal]\n    Z --> AB[Ordinal]\n    Z --> AC[Interval]\n    Z --> AD[Ratio]\n    Y --> AE[Mode]\n    Y --> AF[Conditional Probability]\n    AF --> AG[Bayes' Theorem]\n```\n\n#### **Graph 4: Expected Value & Variance**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    AH[Expected Value] --> AI[Linear Properties]\n    AH --> AJ[Discrete: Summation]\n    AH --> AK[Continuous: Integral]\n    AL[Variance] --> AM[Var(aX + bY)]\n    AL --> AN[Poisson: \u03bb]\n    AL --> AO[Uniform: (b-a)\u00b2/12]\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Exam Tips**\n1. **Probability Problems**:\n   - For \"at most\" questions (Q2), use binomial CDF or complement rule.\n   - For union probabilities (Q13), remember to subtract the intersection.\n2. **Combinatorics**:\n   - Use combinations for \"without replacement\" problems (Q3, Q4).\n   - For numbers > 20,000 (Q9), fix the first digit (2-9) and permute the rest.\n3. **Distributions**:\n   - Poisson: \\( E[X] = \\text{Var}(X) = \\lambda \\). For linear combinations, variance adds (Q5).\n   - Uniform: Use \\( E[X] = \\frac{a+b}{2} \\) to find parameters (Q11).\n4. **Conditional Probability**:\n   - For uniform distributions, conditional probability reduces the interval (Q12).\n   - Use CDF to find PMF (Q15: \\( P(X = x) = F_X(x) - F_X(x^-) \\)).\n5. **Scales of Measurement**:\n   - Nominal: Categories (e.g., number plates).\n   - Ratio: True zero (e.g., life of a bulb).",
