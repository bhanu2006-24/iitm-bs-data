        "summary": "Here\u2019s a structured **summary of core topics, concepts, principles, and equations** essential for the exam, followed by **Mermaid knowledge graphs** to visualize relationships.\n\n---\n\n### **Core Topics & Key Concepts**\n#### **1. Descriptive vs. Inferential Statistics**\n- **Descriptive Statistics**:\n  - Summarizes data (mean, median, variance, percentiles).\n  - Can be applied to **both population and sample data** (Option C is correct in Q2).\n- **Inferential Statistics**:\n  - Makes predictions/inferences about a population using sample data.\n  - Typically used for **samples**, but can technically be applied to population data (though redundant).\n  - **Incorrect Statements in Q2**:\n    - A: Descriptive stats can be done on samples too.\n    - B: Inferential stats are primarily for samples (not \"both\" in practice).\n\n#### **2. Probability Mass Function (PMF) & Expectation**\n- **PMF Properties**:\n  - Sum of probabilities = 1: \\( \\sum P(X = x) = 1 \\).\n  - **Expected Value (Mean)**: \\( E(X) = \\sum x \\cdot P(X = x) \\).\n- **Example (Q3)**:\n  - Given \\( P(X=0) = \\frac{3}{k} \\), \\( P(X=x_2) = \\frac{1}{k} \\), \\( P(X=3) = \\frac{6}{k} \\).\n  - Solve for \\( k \\): \\( \\frac{3}{k} + \\frac{1}{k} + \\frac{6}{k} = 1 \\Rightarrow k = 10 \\).\n  - Use \\( E(X) = 2 \\):\n    \\( 0 \\cdot \\frac{3}{10} + x_2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{10} + 3 \\cdot \\frac{6}{10} = 2 \\Rightarrow x_2 = 2 \\).\n\n#### **3. Variance & Standard Deviation**\n- **Variance**: \\( Var(X) = E(X^2) - [E(X)]^2 \\).\n- **Example (Q4)**:\n  - \\( E(Y) = 0 \\cdot 0.3 + 1 \\cdot 0.4 + 2 \\cdot 0.3 = 1 \\).\n  - \\( E(Y^2) = 0^2 \\cdot 0.3 + 1^2 \\cdot 0.4 + 2^2 \\cdot 0.3 = 1.4 \\).\n  - \\( Var(Y) = 1.4 - 1^2 = 0.4 \\) (but answer is 0.55\u20130.65; likely a typo in options).\n\n#### **4. Probability Rules**\n- **Law of Total Probability (Q5)**:\n  - \\( P(\\text{Good Battery}) = P(A03) \\cdot P(\\text{Good}|A03) + P(S22) \\cdot P(\\text{Good}|S22) \\).\n  - Assume \\( P(A03) = P(S22) = 0.5 \\):\n    \\( 0.5 \\cdot 0.6 + 0.5 \\cdot 0.8 = 0.7 \\).\n\n#### **5. Counting & Sample Spaces (Q6, Q9)**\n- **Sample Space for 3-Child Families (Q6)**:\n  - All possible ordered outcomes: {bbb, bbg, bgb, bgg, gbb, gbg, ggb, ggg}.\n  - Event \"First born is a boy\": {bbb, bbg, bgb, bgg} \u2192 **Option D**.\n- **Permutations (Q9)**:\n  - With repetition: \\( n^n \\).\n  - Without repetition: \\( n! \\).\n  - Difference: \\( n^n - n! = 21 \\). Solve for \\( n = 3 \\).\n\n#### **6. Probability Distributions**\n- **Poisson Distribution (Q7)**:\n  - If \\( X \\sim \\text{Poisson}(\\lambda_1) \\), \\( Y \\sim \\text{Poisson}(\\lambda_2) \\), and independent:\n    - \\( 2X + Y \\) has variance: \\( 4Var(X) + Var(Y) = 4 \\cdot 5 + 3 = 23 \\).\n- **Binomial Distribution (Q11)**:\n  - Probability of **at most 1 success** in \\( n=5 \\) trials with \\( p=0.5 \\):\n    \\( P(X \\leq 1) = P(X=0) + P(X=1) = (0.5)^5 + 5 \\cdot (0.5)^5 = 0.1875 \\).\n- **Exponential Distribution (Q12, Q13)**:\n  - **CDF**: \\( P(X \\leq x) = 1 - e^{-\\lambda x} \\), where \\( \\lambda = \\frac{1}{\\text{mean}} \\).\n  - **Memoryless Property**: \\( P(X > 50 | X > 40) = P(X > 10) = e^{-\\lambda \\cdot 10} \\).\n  - For \\( \\lambda = 0.01 \\):\n    - \\( P(X > 50) = e^{-0.5} \\approx 0.6065 \\).\n- **Uniform Distribution (Q14, Q15)**:\n  - **PDF**: \\( f(x) = \\frac{1}{b-a} \\) for \\( a \\leq x \\leq b \\).\n  - **90th Percentile**: \\( a + 0.9 \\cdot (30 - a) = 29 \\Rightarrow a = 20 \\).\n  - **Expected Value**: \\( \\frac{a + b}{2} = \\frac{20 + 30}{2} = 25 \\).\n\n#### **7. Conditional Probability (Q8)**\n- **Hypergeometric Scenario**:\n  - \\( P(X \\geq 1 | X = 1) = 1 \\) (since \\( X = 1 \\) implies \\( X \\geq 1 \\)).\n  - \\( P(X \\leq b) = 1 \\Rightarrow b = 3 \\) (max possible value of \\( X \\)).\n\n#### **8. Percentiles & Data Transformation (Q10)**\n- **Percentiles**:\n  - Original dataset (sorted): 12, 15, 17, 19, 21.\n    - 50th percentile (median) = 17.\n    - 75th percentile = 19.\n  - Add 4 to all observations: new 75th percentile = 19 + 4 = 23.\n  - Difference: \\( 23 - 17 = 6 \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Mermaid Knowledge Graphs**\n#### **Graph 1: Core Statistical Concepts**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Statistics] --> B[Descriptive Statistics]\n    A --> C[Inferential Statistics]\n    B --> D[Mean/Median/Mode]\n    B --> E[Variance/Percentiles]\n    C --> F[Probability Distributions]\n    C --> G[Hypothesis Testing]\n    F --> H[Discrete: Poisson, Binomial]\n    F --> I[Continuous: Exponential, Uniform]\n```\n\n#### **Graph 2: Probability Distributions & Expectations**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    P[Probability Distributions] --> Q[PMF/PDF]\n    P --> R[Expectation]\n    P --> S[Variance]\n    Q --> T[Discrete: Poisson, Binomial]\n    Q --> U[Continuous: Exponential, Uniform]\n    R --> V[E(X) = \u03a3x\u00b7P(x)]\n    S --> W[Var(X) = E(X\u00b2) - E(X)\u00b2]\n```\n\n#### **Graph 3: Counting & Conditional Probability**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    X[Counting] --> Y[Permutations]\n    X --> Z[Combinations]\n    Y --> Y1[With/Without Repetition]\n    AA[Conditional Probability] --> AB[Bayes' Theorem]\n    AA --> AC[Independent Events]\n    AC --> AD[Poisson/Binomial Independence]\n```\n\n#### **Graph 4: Data Transformation & Percentiles**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    AE[Data Transformation] --> AF[Adding Constants]\n    AE --> AG[Percentiles]\n    AF --> AH[Shift in Mean/Median]\n    AG --> AI[Q1, Q2, Q3]\n    AI --> AJ[Interquartile Range]\n```\n\n---\n### **Key Equations**\n| **Concept**               | **Equation**                                                                 |\n|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Expected Value (Discrete)** | \\( E(X) = \\sum x \\cdot P(X = x) \\)                                         |\n| **Variance**              | \\( Var(X) = E(X^2) - [E(X)]^2 \\)                                            |\n| **Poisson Variance**      | \\( Var(aX + bY) = a^2 Var(X) + b^2 Var(Y) \\) (if independent)               |\n| **Exponential CDF**       | \\( P(X \\leq x) = 1 - e^{-\\lambda x} \\)                                     |\n| **Uniform Percentile**    | \\( P_{90} = a + 0.9 \\cdot (b - a) \\)                                       |\n| **Binomial Probability**  | \\( P(X = k) = C(n, k) \\cdot p^k \\cdot (1-p)^{n-k} \\)                       |\n| **Conditional Probability** | \\( P(A|B) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)} \\)                                    |",
