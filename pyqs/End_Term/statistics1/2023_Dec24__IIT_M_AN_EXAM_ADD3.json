Core Topics & Key Concepts**\n#### **A. Probability Basics**\n1. **Probability Rules**:\n   - Addition Rule: \\( P(A \\cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \\cap B) \\)\n   - Complement Rule: \\( P(A^c) = 1 - P(A) \\)\n   - Conditional Probability: \\( P(A|B) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)} \\)\n   - Independence: \\( P(A \\cap B) = P(A)P(B) \\)\n\n2. **Counting Principles**:\n   - Permutations: \\( P(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{(n-k)!} \\)\n   - Combinations: \\( C(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \\)\n   - **Example**: Selecting 3 pens of different colors (Q3) uses combinations.\n\n3. **Probability Distributions**:\n   - **Binomial Distribution**:\n     - \\( X \\sim \\text{Binomial}(n, p) \\)\n     - \\( P(X = k) = C(n, k) p^k (1-p)^{n-k} \\)\n     - **Example**: Q2 (repairman servicing washing machines).\n   - **Poisson Distribution**:\n     - \\( X \\sim \\text{Poisson}(\\lambda) \\)\n     - \\( P(X = k) = \\frac{e^{-\\lambda} \\lambda^k}{k!} \\)\n     - Variance: \\( \\text{Var}(X) = \\lambda \\)\n     - **Example**: Q5 (independent Poisson RVs \\( X, Y \\) with \\( \\lambda = 2 \\)).\n   - **Uniform Distribution**:\n     - \\( X \\sim \\text{Uniform}(a, b) \\)\n     - PDF: \\( f(x) = \\frac{1}{b-a} \\)\n     - Expected Value: \\( E(X) = \\frac{a+b}{2} \\)\n     - **Example**: Q11 (radio lifetime between \\( a \\) and 150 weeks).\n\n4. **Random Variables**:\n   - **Discrete vs. Continuous**:\n     - Discrete: Countable outcomes (e.g., number of red balls in Q4).\n     - Continuous: Uncountable outcomes (e.g., radio lifetime in Q11).\n   - **Expected Value and Variance**:\n     - \\( E(aX + bY) = aE(X) + bE(Y) \\)\n     - \\( \\text{Var}(aX + bY) = a^2 \\text{Var}(X) + b^2 \\text{Var}(Y) + 2ab \\text{Cov}(X, Y) \\)\n     - For independent RVs: \\( \\text{Cov}(X, Y) = 0 \\).\n     - **Example**: Q5 (\\( \\text{Var}(2X - Y) = 4 \\cdot 2 + 1 \\cdot 2 = 10 \\)).\n\n5. **Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)**:\n   - \\( F_X(x) = P(X \\leq x) \\)\n   - For discrete RVs: \\( P(X = x) = F_X(x) - F_X(x^-) \\)\n   - **Example**: Q15 and Q16 (CDF of discrete RV \\( X \\)).\n\n6. **Bayes\u2019 Theorem & Conditional Probability**:\n   - \\( P(A|B) = \\frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} \\)\n   - **Example**: Q12 (conditional probability of radio lasting >140 weeks given >130 weeks).\n\n7. **Measurement Scales**:\n   - **Nominal**: Categories with no order (e.g., vehicle number plates in Q6).\n   - **Ordinal**: Categories with order (e.g., survey ratings).\n   - **Interval**: Ordered with equal intervals (e.g., temperature in Celsius).\n   - **Ratio**: Interval + true zero (e.g., life of a bulb in hours in Q6).\n\n8. **Combinatorics**:\n   - **Permutations with Restrictions**:\n     - **Example**: Q9 (numbers >20,000 using digits {0,1,3,5,7,9} without repetition).\n   - **Combinations with Constraints**:\n     - **Example**: Q3 (selecting pens of different colors).\n\n9. **Probability Mass Function (PMF)**:\n   - \\( \\sum_x P(X = x) = 1 \\)\n   - **Example**: Q7 (finding \\( x_3 \\) given \\( E(X) = 2 \\)).\n\n10. **Mode and Relative Frequency**:\n    - Mode: Most frequent value.\n    - Relative Frequency: \\( \\frac{\\text{Frequency}}{\\text{Total}} \\).\n    - **Example**: Q8 (Hindi as the only mode in language data).\n\n---\n\n### **2.

Exam Tips**\n1. **Binomial vs. Poisson**:\n   - Use **Binomial** for fixed trials (e.g., washing machines in Q2).\n   - Use **Poisson** for rare events (e.g., defects in Q5).\n\n2. **Combinatorics**:\n   - For **permutations**, check if order matters (e.g., Q9).\n   - For **combinations**, use when order doesn\u2019t matter (e.g., Q3).\n\n3. **CDF/PMF**:\n   - For discrete RVs, \\( P(X = x) \\) is the jump in CDF at \\( x \\) (Q15, Q16).\n\n4. **Measurement Scales**:\n   - **Nominal**: No order (e.g., vehicle plates in Q6).\n   - **Ratio**: True zero (e.g., bulb life in hours in Q6).\n\n5. **Uniform Distribution**:\n   - Expected value is midpoint: \\( E(X) = \\frac{a+b}{2} \\) (Q11).\n\n6. **Variance of Linear Combinations**:\n   - For independent RVs, \\( \\text{Var}(aX - bY) = a^2 \\text{Var}(X) + b^2 \\text{Var}(Y) \\) (Q5).\n\n7. **Mode & Relative Frequency**:\n   - Mode is the most frequent value (Q8).\n   - Relative frequency = frequency / total (Q8).",
