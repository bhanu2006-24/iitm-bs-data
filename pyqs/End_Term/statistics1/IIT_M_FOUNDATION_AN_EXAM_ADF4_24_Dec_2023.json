Core Topics & Concepts**\n### **A. Probability Basics**\n1. **Probability Rules**\n   - Addition Rule: \\( P(A \\cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \\cap B) \\)\n   - Complement Rule: \\( P(A^c) = 1 - P(A) \\)\n   - Conditional Probability: \\( P(A|B) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)} \\)\n   - Independence: \\( P(A \\cap B) = P(A)P(B) \\)\n\n2. **Counting Principles**\n   - Permutations (Order matters): \\( P(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{(n-k)!} \\)\n   - Combinations (Order doesn\u2019t matter): \\( C(n, k) = \\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \\)\n\n3. **Probability Distributions**\n   - **Discrete Distributions**:\n     - **Binomial Distribution**:\n       \\( P(X = k) = \\binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k} \\)\n       Mean: \\( \\mu = np \\), Variance: \\( \\sigma^2 = np(1-p) \\)\n     - **Poisson Distribution**:\n       \\( P(X = k) = \\frac{e^{-\\lambda} \\lambda^k}{k!} \\)\n       Mean & Variance: \\( \\lambda \\)\n     - **Uniform Distribution (Discrete)**:\n       \\( P(X = x) = \\frac{1}{n} \\) for \\( x = 1, 2, ..., n \\)\n   - **Continuous Distributions**:\n     - **Uniform Distribution (Continuous)**:\n       \\( f(x) = \\frac{1}{b-a} \\) for \\( a \\leq x \\leq b \\)\n       Mean: \\( \\frac{a+b}{2} \\), Variance: \\( \\frac{(b-a)^2}{12} \\)\n     - **Conditional Probability for Uniform**:\n       \\( P(X > x_1 | X > x_0) = \\frac{b - x_1}{b - x_0} \\)\n\n4. **Expected Value & Variance**\n   - Expected Value (Mean):\n     \\( E(X) = \\sum x P(x) \\) (Discrete)\n     \\( E(X) = \\int x f(x) \\, dx \\) (Continuous)\n   - Variance:\n     \\( Var(X) = E(X^2) - [E(X)]^2 \\)\n   - Properties:\n     - \\( E(aX + b) = aE(X) + b \\)\n     - \\( Var(aX + b) = a^2 Var(X) \\)\n     - For independent \\( X, Y \\): \\( Var(X \\pm Y) = Var(X) + Var(Y) \\)\n\n5. **Random Variables & CDF/PDF**\n   - **Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)**:\n     \\( F_X(x) = P(X \\leq x) \\)\n     \\( P(a \\leq X \\leq b) = F_X(b) - F_X(a) \\)\n   - **Probability Mass Function (PMF)**:\n     \\( P(X = x) = F_X(x) - F_X(x^-) \\)\n   - **Probability Density Function (PDF)**:\n     \\( f_X(x) = \\frac{d}{dx} F_X(x) \\)\n\n---\n\n### **B. Descriptive Statistics**\n1. **Scales of Measurement**\n   - **Nominal**: Categories (e.g., vehicle number plates).\n   - **Ordinal**: Ordered categories (e.g., survey ratings).\n   - **Interval**: Ordered with equal intervals (e.g., temperature in \u00b0C).\n   - **Ratio**: True zero (e.g., life of a bulb in hours, amount of milk in liters).\n\n2. **Discrete vs. Continuous Variables**\n   - **Discrete**: Countable (e.g., number of red balls).\n   - **Continuous**: Uncountable (e.g., lifetime of a radio in weeks).\n\n---\n\n### **C. Combinatorics**\n1. **Permutations & Combinations**\n   - **With Repetition**:\n     - Permutations: \\( n^k \\)\n     - Combinations: \\( \\binom{n+k-1}{k} \\)\n   - **Without Repetition**:\n     - Permutations: \\( P(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{(n-k)!} \\)\n     - Combinations: \\( C(n, k) = \\binom{n}{k} \\)\n\n2. **Multinomial Coefficients**\n   - Number of ways to partition \\( n \\) items into groups of sizes \\( k_1, k_2, ..., k_m \\):\n     \\( \\frac{n!}{k_1! k_2! ... k_m!} \\)\n\n---\n\n### **D. Probability Applications**\n1. **Binomial Probability**\n   - Example: Probability of at most \\( k \\) successes in \\( n \\) trials.\n     \\( P(X \\leq k) = \\sum_{i=0}^k \\binom{n}{i} p^i (1-p)^{n-i} \\)\n\n2. **Poisson Process**\n   - Example: Variance of linear combinations of Poisson RVs.\n     If \\( X, Y \\sim \\text{Poisson}(\\lambda) \\), then \\( Var(aX + bY) = a^2 \\lambda + b^2 \\lambda \\).\n\n3. **Uniform Distribution**\n   - Example: Conditional probability for lifetimes.\n     \\( P(X > x_1 | X > x_0) = \\frac{b - x_1}{b - x_0} \\)\n\n---\n\n## **2.

Exam-Specific Insights**\n1. **Question Types**:\n   - **Probability Calculations**: Binomial, Poisson, Uniform.\n   - **Combinatorics**: Permutations, combinations, multinomial.\n   - **Descriptive Stats**: Scales of measurement, discrete vs. continuous.\n   - **Expected Value/Variance**: Linear combinations of RVs.\n   - **Conditional Probability**: Uniform distribution, CDF/PDF.\n\n2. **Common Pitfalls**:\n   - Misapplying **addition vs. multiplication rules**.\n   - Confusing **permutations vs. combinations**.\n   - Incorrectly calculating **conditional probabilities**.\n   - Forgetting to **standardize** when using CDF/PDF.\n\n3. **Key Takeaways**:\n   - **Binomial**: Use for fixed \\( n \\) trials with success probability \\( p \\).\n   - **Poisson**: Use for rare events over time/space.\n   - **Uniform**: Equal probability for all outcomes in a range.\n   - **Variance**: Always squares the coefficient (e.g., \\( Var(aX) = a^2 Var(X) \\)).\n   - **CDF**: \\( P(a \\leq X \\leq b) = F(b) - F(a) \\).",
