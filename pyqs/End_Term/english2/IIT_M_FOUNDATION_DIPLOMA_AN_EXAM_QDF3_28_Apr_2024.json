Coming to my education, I have an MBA in marketing, which I did from Balaji Institute of Modern Management, Pune. I did my BBM from St. Paul\u2019s College in Mangalore. I am currently 33 years old and I live in Bangalore with my husband.  Interviewer: I see. Tell me, why do you want to work with us? It seems like you already have a good job.  Ramya: Yes, sir. I do have a good job, but I am looking for a change in responsibilities. I feel like I have reached my ceiling at my present company. Moreover, it is a wonderful company to work for, but I need more experience and exposure. Hence, I decided to take this step.  Interviewer: Good, that\u2019s good. So tell me why you think you would be a good fit at our company?  Ramya: Sir, I have heard good things about your company in the news lately. Moreover, I believe I have the qualification and experience necessary for this job. However, I would say my biggest driving force to join your organization is my passion for this line of work.

Ramya: Since my company was in the education field, we mainly focused on digital marketing \u2013 using various tools and techniques to promote our website. You see, our organization makes sales from the leads we generate online. Hence, it is an important responsibility. I also oversaw the daily tasks which were done by my team. I also provide regular reports on the team\u2019s performance and also provide insights if there are any new trends in the world of digital marketing.

Ramya: Thank you, sir.  Interviewer: Please have a seat.  (Interviewer reads through her resume)  Interviewer: Hello, Ramya. Please introduce yourself.  Ramya: I am currently working as a Digital Marketing Manager in Wipro. I have about 3 years of experience in this field. Before this, I worked for 2 years as a content editor in Vedantu, which is also an educational company. Coming to my education, I have an MBA in marketing, which I did from Balaji Institute of Modern Management, Pune. I did my BBM from St. Paul\u2019s College in Mangalore. I am currently 33 years old and I live in Bangalore with my husband.  Interviewer: I see. Tell me, why do you want to work with us? It seems like you already have a good job.  Ramya: Yes, sir. I do have a good job, but I am looking for a change in responsibilities. I feel like I have reached my ceiling at my present company. Moreover, it is a wonderful company to work for, but I need more experience and exposure. Hence, I decided to take this step.  Interviewer: Good, that\u2019s good. So tell me why you think you would be a good fit at our company?  Ramya: Sir, I have heard good things about your company in the news lately. Moreover, I believe I have the qualification and experience necessary for this job. However, I would say my biggest driving force to join your organization is my passion for this line of work. In fact, I feel enthusiastic when I do my job.  Interviewer: That sounds fascinating! So what responsibilities did you handle at your company?  Ramya: Since my company was in the education field, we mainly focused on digital marketing \u2013 using various tools and techniques to promote our website. You see, our organization makes sales from the leads we generate online. Hence, it is an important responsibility. I also oversaw the daily tasks which were done by my team. I also provide regular reports on the team\u2019s performance and also provide insights if there are any new trends in the world of digital marketing. That way, I can ensure that my team is up-to-date with the current trends and they can plan their work accordingly."

Ramya: I am currently working as a Digital Marketing Manager in Wipro. I have about 3 years of experience in this field. Before this, I worked for 2 years as a content editor in Vedantu, which is also an educational company. Coming to my education, I have an MBA in marketing, which I did from Balaji Institute of Modern Management, Pune. I did my BBM from St. Paul\u2019s College in Mangalore. I am currently 33 years old and I live in Bangalore with my husband.  Interviewer: I see. Tell me, why do you want to work with us? It seems like you already have a good job.  Ramya: Yes, sir. I do have a good job, but I am looking for a change in responsibilities. I feel like I have reached my ceiling at my present company. Moreover, it is a wonderful company to work for, but I need more experience and exposure. Hence, I decided to take this step.  Interviewer: Good, that\u2019s good. So tell me why you think you would be a good fit at our company?  Ramya: Sir, I have heard good things about your company in the news lately. Moreover, I believe I have the qualification and experience necessary for this job. However, I would say my biggest driving force to join your organization is my passion for this line of work. In fact, I feel enthusiastic when I do my job.  Interviewer: That sounds fascinating! So what responsibilities did you handle at your company?  Ramya: Since my company was in the education field, we mainly focused on digital marketing \u2013 using various tools and techniques to promote our website. You see, our organization makes sales from the leads we generate online. Hence, it is an important responsibility. I also oversaw the daily tasks which were done by my team. I also provide regular reports on the team\u2019s performance and also provide insights if there are any new trends in the world of digital marketing. That way, I can ensure that my team is up-to-date with the current trends and they can plan their work accordingly.",

Ramya: Thank you, sir.  Interviewer: Please have a seat.  (Interviewer reads through her resume)  Interviewer: Hello, Ramya. Please introduce yourself.  Ramya: I am currently working as a Digital Marketing Manager in Wipro. I have about 3 years of experience in this field. Before this, I worked for 2 years as a content editor in Vedantu, which is also an educational company. Coming to my education, I have an MBA in marketing, which I did from Balaji Institute of Modern Management, Pune. I did my BBM from St. Paul\u2019s College in Mangalore. I am currently 33 years old and I live in Bangalore with my husband.  Interviewer: I see. Tell me, why do you want to work with us? It seems like you already have a good job.  Ramya: Yes, sir. I do have a good job, but I am looking for a change in responsibilities. I feel like I have reached my ceiling at my present company. Moreover, it is a wonderful company to work for, but I need more experience and exposure. Hence, I decided to take this step.  Interviewer: Good, that\u2019s good. So tell me why you think you would be a good fit at our company?  Ramya: Sir, I have heard good things about your company in the news lately. Moreover, I believe I have the qualification and experience necessary for this job. However, I would say my biggest driving force to join your organization is my passion for this line of work. In fact, I feel enthusiastic when I do my job.  Interviewer: That sounds fascinating! So what responsibilities did you handle at your company?  Ramya: Since my company was in the education field, we mainly focused on digital marketing \u2013 using various tools and techniques to promote our website. You see, our organization makes sales from the leads we generate online. Hence, it is an important responsibility. I also oversaw the daily tasks which were done by my team. I also provide regular reports on the team\u2019s performance and also provide insights if there are any new trends in the world of digital marketing. That way, I can ensure that my team is up-to-date with the current trends and they can plan their work accordingly."

Interviewer: Yes, please come in.  Ramya: Thank you, sir.  Interviewer: Please have a seat.  (Interviewer reads through her resume)  Interviewer: Hello, Ramya. Please introduce yourself.  Ramya: I am currently working as a Digital Marketing Manager in Wipro. I have about 3 years of experience in this field. Before this, I worked for 2 years as a content editor in Vedantu, which is also an educational company. Coming to my education, I have an MBA in marketing, which I did from Balaji Institute of Modern Management, Pune. I did my BBM from St. Paul\u2019s College in Mangalore. I am currently 33 years old and I live in Bangalore with my husband.  Interviewer: I see. Tell me, why do you want to work with us? It seems like you already have a good job.  Ramya: Yes, sir. I do have a good job, but I am looking for a change in responsibilities. I feel like I have reached my ceiling at my present company. Moreover, it is a wonderful company to work for, but I need more experience and exposure. Hence, I decided to take this step.  Interviewer: Good, that\u2019s good. So tell me why you think you would be a good fit at our company?  Ramya: Sir, I have heard good things about your company in the news lately. Moreover, I believe I have the qualification and experience necessary for this job. However, I would say my biggest driving force to join your organization is my passion for this line of work. In fact, I feel enthusiastic when I do my job.  Interviewer: That sounds fascinating! So what responsibilities did you handle at your company?  Ramya: Since my company was in the education field, we mainly focused on digital marketing \u2013 using various tools and techniques to promote our website. You see, our organization makes sales from the leads we generate online. Hence, it is an important responsibility. I also oversaw the daily tasks which were done by my team. I also provide regular reports on the team\u2019s performance and also provide insights if there are any new trends in the world of digital marketing. That way, I can ensure that my team is up-to-date with the current trends and they can plan their work accordingly.",

Ramya: Thank you, sir.  Interviewer: Please have a seat.  (Interviewer reads through her resume)  Interviewer: Hello, Ramya. Please introduce yourself.  Ramya: I am currently working as a Digital Marketing Manager in Wipro. I have about 3 years of experience in this field. Before this, I worked for 2 years as a content editor in Vedantu, which is also an educational company. Coming to my education, I have an MBA in marketing, which I did from Balaji Institute of Modern Management, Pune. I did my BBM from St. Paul\u2019s College in Mangalore. I am currently 33 years old and I live in Bangalore with my husband.  Interviewer: I see. Tell me, why do you want to work with us? It seems like you already have a good job.  Ramya: Yes, sir. I do have a good job, but I am looking for a change in responsibilities. I feel like I have reached my ceiling at my present company. Moreover, it is a wonderful company to work for, but I need more experience and exposure. Hence, I decided to take this step.  Interviewer: Good, that\u2019s good. So tell me why you think you would be a good fit at our company?  Ramya: Sir, I have heard good things about your company in the news lately. Moreover, I believe I have the qualification and experience necessary for this job. However, I would say my biggest driving force to join your organization is my passion for this line of work. In fact, I feel enthusiastic when I do my job.  Interviewer: That sounds fascinating! So what responsibilities did you handle at your company?  Ramya: Since my company was in the education field, we mainly focused on digital marketing \u2013 using various tools and techniques to promote our website. You see, our organization makes sales from the leads we generate online. Hence, it is an important responsibility. I also oversaw the daily tasks which were done by my team. I also provide regular reports on the team\u2019s performance and also provide insights if there are any new trends in the world of digital marketing. That way, I can ensure that my team is up-to-date with the current trends and they can plan their work accordingly."
