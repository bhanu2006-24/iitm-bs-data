Whether you are in Rio de Janeiro or Bangkok, New Delhi or New York City, your animal instinct tells you that it is safer to ___________ as part of a herd than on your own. Fear brings us closer together. The evidence is not just anecdotal. When we are herding, neuroimaging experiments show increased activation in the amygdala area of the brain, where fear and other negative emotions are processed. While you may feel vulnerable and exposed on your own, being part of the herd gives you a distinct sense of protection. You know in your guts that, in the midst of others, the risk of being hit by a car is lower because it is somehow distributed among the group\u2019s members. The more of them, the lower the risk. There is safety in numbers. And so much more than mere safety.  Herding also comes with an intoxicating sense of power: as members of a crowd, we feel much stronger and braver than we are in fact. And sometimes we act accordingly. The same person who, on his own, wouldn\u2019t \u2018hurt a fly\u2019 will not hesitate to set a government building on fire or rob a liquor store when part of an angry mass. The most mild-mannered of us can make the meanest comments as part of an online mob. A herd can do wonders of psychological transformation in its individual members; in no time, prudence turns into folly, caution into recklessness, decency into savagery. Once caught up in the maelstrom, it is extremely difficult to hold back: you see it as your duty to participate. Any act of lynching, ancient or modern, literal or on social media, displays this feature. \u2018A murder shared with many others, which is not only safe and permitted, but indeed recommended, is irresistible to the great majority of men,\u2019 writes Elias Canetti in Crowds and Power (1960).  The herd can also give its members a disproportionate sense of personal worth. No matter how empty or miserable their individual existence may otherwise be, belonging to a certain group makes them feel accepted and recognised \u2013 even respected. There is no hole in one\u2019s personal life, no matter how big, that one\u2019s intense devotion to one\u2019s tribe cannot fill, no trauma that it does not seem to heal. That\u2019s why cults and gangs, fringe organisations or sects hold such an extraordinary appeal: to a disoriented soul, they can offer a sense of fulfilment and recognition that neither family nor friends nor profession can supply. A crowd can be therapeutic in the same way in which a highly toxic substance can have curative powers.  Herding, then, engenders a paradoxical form of identity: you are somebody not despite the fact that you\u2019ve melted into the crowd, but because of it. You may be nobody on your own, and your life an empty shell, yet once you\u2019ve managed to establish a meaningful connection with the herd, its volcanic, boundless life overflows into yours and more than fulfills it. You will not be able to find yourself in the crowd, but that\u2019s the least of your worries: you are now part of something that feels so much grander and nobler than your poor self. Your connection with the life of the herd not only fills an inner vacuum but adds a sense of purpose to your disoriented existence. And the more individuals bring their disorientedness to the party, the livelier it gets. And all the more dangerous.",

                            "Read the following passage and answer the given subquestions  Have you noticed how, when crossing a busy road, you feel a sudden urge to speed up and melt into the crowd? Whether you are in Rio de Janeiro or Bangkok, New Delhi or New York City, your animal instinct tells you that it is safer to ___________ as part of a herd than on your own. Fear brings us closer together. The evidence is not just anecdotal. When we are herding, neuroimaging experiments show increased activation in the amygdala area of the brain, where fear and other negative emotions are processed. While you may feel vulnerable and exposed on your own, being part of the herd gives you a distinct sense of protection. You know in your guts that, in the midst of others, the risk of being hit by a car is lower because it is somehow distributed among the group\u2019s members. The more of them, the lower the risk. There is safety in numbers. And so much more than mere safety.  Herding also comes with an intoxicating sense of power: as members of a crowd, we feel much stronger and braver than we are in fact. And sometimes we act accordingly. The same person who, on his own, wouldn\u2019t \u2018hurt a fly\u2019 will not hesitate to set a government building on fire or rob a liquor store when part of an angry mass. The most mild-mannered of us can make the meanest comments as part of an online mob. A herd can do wonders of psychological transformation in its individual members; in no time, prudence turns into folly, caution into recklessness, decency into savagery. Once caught up in the maelstrom, it is extremely difficult to hold back: you see it as your duty to participate. Any act of lynching, ancient or modern, literal or on social media, displays this feature. \u2018A murder shared with many others, which is not only safe and permitted, but indeed recommended, is irresistible to the great majority of men,\u2019 writes Elias Canetti in Crowds and Power (1960).  The herd can also give its members a disproportionate sense of personal worth. No matter how empty or miserable their individual existence may otherwise be, belonging to a certain group makes them feel accepted and recognised \u2013 even respected. There is no hole in one\u2019s personal life, no matter how big, that one\u2019s intense devotion to one\u2019s tribe cannot fill, no trauma that it does not seem to heal. That\u2019s why cults and gangs, fringe organisations or sects hold such an extraordinary appeal: to a disoriented soul, they can offer a sense of fulfilment and recognition that neither family nor friends nor profession can supply. A crowd can be therapeutic in the same way in which a highly toxic substance can have curative powers.  Herding, then, engenders a paradoxical form of identity: you are somebody not despite the fact that you\u2019ve melted into the crowd, but because of it. You may be nobody on your own, and your life an empty shell, yet once you\u2019ve managed to establish a meaningful connection with the herd, its volcanic, boundless life overflows into yours and more than fulfills it. You will not be able to find yourself in the crowd, but that\u2019s the least of your worries: you are now part of something that feels so much grander and nobler than your poor self. Your connection with the life of the herd not only fills an inner vacuum but adds a sense of purpose to your disoriented existence. And the more individuals bring their disorientedness to the party, the livelier it gets. And all the more dangerous."

Any act of lynching, ancient or modern, literal or on social media, displays this feature. \u2018A murder shared with many others, which is not only safe and permitted, but indeed recommended, is irresistible to the great majority of men,\u2019 writes Elias Canetti in Crowds and Power (1960).  The herd can also give its members a disproportionate sense of personal worth. No matter how empty or miserable their individual existence may otherwise be, belonging to a certain group makes them feel accepted and recognised \u2013 even respected. There is no hole in one\u2019s personal life, no matter how big, that one\u2019s intense devotion to one\u2019s tribe cannot fill, no trauma that it does not seem to heal. That\u2019s why cults and gangs, fringe organisations or sects hold such an extraordinary appeal: to a disoriented soul, they can offer a sense of fulfilment and recognition that neither family nor friends nor profession can supply. A crowd can be therapeutic in the same way in which a highly toxic substance can have curative powers.  Herding, then, engenders a paradoxical form of identity: you are somebody not despite the fact that you\u2019ve melted into the crowd, but because of it. You may be nobody on your own, and your life an empty shell, yet once you\u2019ve managed to establish a meaningful connection with the herd, its volcanic, boundless life overflows into yours and more than fulfills it. You will not be able to find yourself in the crowd, but that\u2019s the least of your worries: you are now part of something that feels so much grander and nobler than your poor self. Your connection with the life of the herd not only fills an inner vacuum but adds a sense of purpose to your disoriented existence. And the more individuals bring their disorientedness to the party, the livelier it gets. And all the more dangerous."

                            "Read the following passage and answer the given subquestions  Have you noticed how, when crossing a busy road, you feel a sudden urge to speed up and melt into the crowd? Whether you are in Rio de Janeiro or Bangkok, New Delhi or New York City, your animal instinct tells you that it is safer to ___________ as part of a herd than on your own. Fear brings us closer together. The evidence is not just anecdotal. When we are herding, neuroimaging experiments show increased activation in the amygdala area of the brain, where fear and other negative emotions are processed. While you may feel vulnerable and exposed on your own, being part of the herd gives you a distinct sense of protection. You know in your guts that, in the midst of others, the risk of being hit by a car is lower because it is somehow distributed among the group\u2019s members. The more of them, the lower the risk. There is safety in numbers. And so much more than mere safety.  Herding also comes with an intoxicating sense of power: as members of a crowd, we feel much stronger and braver than we are in fact. And sometimes we act accordingly. The same person who, on his own, wouldn\u2019t \u2018hurt a fly\u2019 will not hesitate to set a government building on fire or rob a liquor store when part of an angry mass. The most mild-mannered of us can make the meanest comments as part of an online mob. A herd can do wonders of psychological transformation in its individual members; in no time, prudence turns into folly, caution into recklessness, decency into savagery. Once caught up in the maelstrom, it is extremely difficult to hold back: you see it as your duty to participate. Any act of lynching, ancient or modern, literal or on social media, displays this feature. \u2018A murder shared with many others, which is not only safe and permitted, but indeed recommended, is irresistible to the great majority of men,\u2019 writes Elias Canetti in Crowds and Power (1960).  The herd can also give its members a disproportionate sense of personal worth. No matter how empty or miserable their individual existence may otherwise be, belonging to a certain group makes them feel accepted and recognised \u2013 even respected. There is no hole in one\u2019s personal life, no matter how big, that one\u2019s intense devotion to one\u2019s tribe cannot fill, no trauma that it does not seem to heal. That\u2019s why cults and gangs, fringe organisations or sects hold such an extraordinary appeal: to a disoriented soul, they can offer a sense of fulfilment and recognition that neither family nor friends nor profession can supply. A crowd can be therapeutic in the same way in which a highly toxic substance can have curative powers.  Herding, then, engenders a paradoxical form of identity: you are somebody not despite the fact that you\u2019ve melted into the crowd, but because of it. You may be nobody on your own, and your life an empty shell, yet once you\u2019ve managed to establish a meaningful connection with the herd, its volcanic, boundless life overflows into yours and more than fulfills it. You will not be able to find yourself in the crowd, but that\u2019s the least of your worries: you are now part of something that feels so much grander and nobler than your poor self. Your connection with the life of the herd not only fills an inner vacuum but adds a sense of purpose to your disoriented existence. And the more individuals bring their disorientedness to the party, the livelier it gets. And all the more dangerous."

Lavanya: Yes, it says we have to \u2018Investigate some aspect of the university facilities\u2019. Paul: Yeah, we have to design a questionnaire, don\u2019t we? Lavanya: Yes. And we have to write a report and do a presentation. Paul: How long does it have to be? 1000 words, isn\u2019t it? Lavanya: Let me see. The report has to be between 1000 and 1500 words, and we have to do that on our own, but we do the presentation and the investigation as a group. Lavanya: So, have you got any ideas about what we can investigate? Karan: I know one of the other groups is looking at the university library and whether it\u2019s adequate for student needs. Paul: Yes, and one group\u2019s doing the sports center. Karan: I was wondering about investigating transport. Paul: Transport? Lavanya: Yes, we could look at whether people think the bus service is regular enough, and we could also look at car parking facilities. Paul: We could look at the cycle parking facilities too. There\u2019s never enough space for all the cycles in the cycle sheds. I\u2019m sure the university could afford to build more, what with all the fees we pay. Karan: OK, I\u2019m happy with that idea. So, how should we go about the investigation then? Lavanya: Well, we could make some questionnaires. I can ask the people who travel on buses, and Paul, you can ask cyclists, and Karan, you do a questionnaire for car drivers.  Karan: Shouldn\u2019t we write the questions together, rather than individually? Lavanya: Yes, that\u2019s what I meant, we can write the questionnaires together, but each of us can be responsible for carrying out the questionnaires individually. Does that sound okay?  Karan: It sounds good. Okay, well, let\u2019s think about these questions then.",

Lavanya: Yes, it says we have to \u2018Investigate some aspect of the university facilities\u2019. Paul: Yeah, we have to design a questionnaire, don\u2019t we? Lavanya: Yes. And we have to write a report and do a presentation. Paul: How long does it have to be? 1000 words, isn\u2019t it? Lavanya: Let me see. The report has to be between 1000 and 1500 words, and we have to do that on our own, but we do the presentation and the investigation as a group. Lavanya: So, have you got any ideas about what we can investigate? Karan: I know one of the other groups is looking at the university library and whether it\u2019s adequate for student needs. Paul: Yes, and one group\u2019s doing the sports center. Karan: I was wondering about investigating transport. Paul: Transport? Lavanya: Yes, we could look at whether people think the bus service is regular enough, and we could also look at car parking facilities. Paul: We could look at the cycle parking facilities too. There\u2019s never enough space for all the cycles in the cycle sheds. I\u2019m sure the university could afford to build more, what with all the fees we pay. Karan: OK, I\u2019m happy with that idea. So, how should we go about the investigation then? Lavanya: Well, we could make some questionnaires. I can ask the people who travel on buses, and Paul, you can ask cyclists, and Karan, you do a questionnaire for car drivers.  Karan: Shouldn\u2019t we write the questions together, rather than individually? Lavanya: Yes, that\u2019s what I meant, we can write the questionnaires together, but each of us can be responsible for carrying out the questionnaires individually. Does that sound okay?  Karan: It sounds good. Okay, well, let\u2019s think about these questions then."

Lavanya: Yes, it says we have to \u2018Investigate some aspect of the university facilities\u2019. Paul: Yeah, we have to design a questionnaire, don\u2019t we? Lavanya: Yes. And we have to write a report and do a presentation. Paul: How long does it have to be? 1000 words, isn\u2019t it? Lavanya: Let me see. The report has to be between 1000 and 1500 words, and we have to do that on our own, but we do the presentation and the investigation as a group. Lavanya: So, have you got any ideas about what we can investigate? Karan: I know one of the other groups is looking at the university library and whether it\u2019s adequate for student needs. Paul: Yes, and one group\u2019s doing the sports center. Karan: I was wondering about investigating transport. Paul: Transport? Lavanya: Yes, we could look at whether people think the bus service is regular enough, and we could also look at car parking facilities. Paul: We could look at the cycle parking facilities too. There\u2019s never enough space for all the cycles in the cycle sheds. I\u2019m sure the university could afford to build more, what with all the fees we pay. Karan: OK, I\u2019m happy with that idea. So, how should we go about the investigation then? Lavanya: Well, we could make some questionnaires. I can ask the people who travel on buses, and Paul, you can ask cyclists, and Karan, you do a questionnaire for car drivers.  Karan: Shouldn\u2019t we write the questions together, rather than individually? Lavanya: Yes, that\u2019s what I meant, we can write the questionnaires together, but each of us can be responsible for carrying out the questionnaires individually. Does that sound okay?  Karan: It sounds good. Okay, well, let\u2019s think about these questions then.",

Paul: Yes, and one group\u2019s doing the sports center. Karan: I was wondering about investigating transport. Paul: Transport? Lavanya: Yes, we could look at whether people think the bus service is regular enough, and we could also look at car parking facilities. Paul: We could look at the cycle parking facilities too. There\u2019s never enough space for all the cycles in the cycle sheds. I\u2019m sure the university could afford to build more, what with all the fees we pay. Karan: OK, I\u2019m happy with that idea. So, how should we go about the investigation then? Lavanya: Well, we could make some questionnaires. I can ask the people who travel on buses, and Paul, you can ask cyclists, and Karan, you do a questionnaire for car drivers.  Karan: Shouldn\u2019t we write the questions together, rather than individually? Lavanya: Yes, that\u2019s what I meant, we can write the questionnaires together, but each of us can be responsible for carrying out the questionnaires individually. Does that sound okay?

Karan: OK, I\u2019m happy with that idea. So, how should we go about the investigation then? Lavanya: Well, we could make some questionnaires. I can ask the people who travel on buses, and Paul, you can ask cyclists, and Karan, you do a questionnaire for car drivers.

        "summary": "Here\u2019s a structured **summary of core topics, concepts, and principles** for the **\"Foundation Level: Semester 2: English 2 (Computer-Based Exam)\"** based on the question paper.\nThe exam focuses on **reading comprehension, grammar, vocabulary, discourse analysis, and professional communication (emails, workplace interactions)**.\n\n---\n\n### **1. Reading Comprehension (Passage-Based Questions)**\n#### **Core Themes:**\n- **Herd Mentality & Crowd Psychology**\n  - Concepts: Safety in numbers, psychological transformation (prudence \u2192 recklessness), paradoxical identity, sense of belonging, and mob behavior.\n  - Key Terms: *Amygdala activation, maelstrom, disproportionate sense of worth, therapeutic appeal of crowds, lynching, disorientedness*.\n  - **Outcomes of Herding**:\n    - Protection, reduced risk, intoxicating power, loss of individualism, savagery, therapeutic fulfillment.\n  - **Contrasts**:\n    - Individual vs. group behavior (e.g., \"wouldn\u2019t hurt a fly\" vs. setting buildings on fire).\n  - **Authors/References**: Elias Canetti (*Crowds and Power*, 1960).\n\n- **Economic & Workforce Trends (Frontline Workers Passage)**\n  - Key Data Points:\n    - 8M+ jobs created in FY 2022 (post-pandemic).\n    - E-commerce > logistics > mobility in demand.\n    - Top states: Maharashtra, Karnataka, Andhra/Telangana, Tamil Nadu (60% supply, 65% demand).\n    - Mumbai: 24.7% supply, 20.9% demand.\n  - Vocabulary: *Frontline workers, retail consumption, Q2, supply/demand*.\n\n#### **Question Types:**\n- Fill-in-the-blanks (contextual vocabulary).\n- True/False statements.\n- Inference-based (e.g., \"Why do gangs flourish?\").\n- Synonyms/antonyms (e.g., *vulnerable \u2192 insecure*, *maelstrom \u2192 whirlpool*).\n\n---\n\n### **2. Grammar & Syntax**\n#### **Key Concepts:**\n1. **Tenses**:\n   - Past perfect: *had listened* (Q45).\n   - Present perfect continuous: *have been searching* (Q58 indirect speech: *had been searching*).\n2. **Conditionals**:\n   - Second conditional: *If I were you, I would...* (Q57).\n3. **Sentence Types**:\n   - Simple: *The day after tomorrow is a holiday* (Q47).\n   - Compound: *He is funny, yet he is polite* (Q50; coordinated with *yet*).\n   - Complex: *The articles that I bought...* (Q51; relative clause *that*).\n4. **Clauses & Phrases**:\n   - Adverbial phrase of place: *to the sea* (Q46).\n   - Relative pronoun: *that* (Q51).\n   - Adjunct: *In the afternoons* (Q48).\n5. **Conjunctions**:\n   - Subordinating: *before, because, unless* (Q49; *and* is coordinating).\n6. **Modals**:\n   - *Must* (logical certainty: *The exam must be tough*; Q52).\n   - *Could* (past ability: *The play could be starting late*; Q53).\n7. **Question Tags**:\n   - *Isn\u2019t it?* for *It is well done* (Q54).\n8. **Mood**:\n   - Indicative: *This is my friend* (Q44).\n9. **Voice & Reported Speech**:\n   - Indirect speech shift: *We \u2192 They* (Q58).\n10. **Prefixes/Suffixes**:\n    - *Unhappy* (prefix *un-*), *disappeared* (prefix *dis-*; Q60).\n\n#### **Common Pitfalls:**\n- Misidentifying sentence types (e.g., compound vs. complex).\n- Confusing subordinating/coordinating conjunctions.\n- Incorrect modal usage (e.g., *must not* vs. *should not*).\n\n---\n\n### **3. Vocabulary & Semantics**\n#### **Key Areas:**\n1. **Synonyms/Antonyms**:\n   - *Transcendence* \u2260 *mundane* (Q17).\n   - *Achievement = accomplishment* (Q18).\n   - *Competitive = ambitious* (Q20).\n2. **Phrasal Verbs**:\n   - *Wear out*: become useless through overuse (Q21).\n3. **Idioms/Similes**:\n   - *Dead as a doornail* (simile; Q43).\n4. **Discourse Markers**:\n   - *First of all, I mean* (Q42).\n5. **Professional Jargon**:\n   - *EGOT*: Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, Tony (Q12).\n   - *Ironman Triathlon*: swim, cycle, run (Q14; 26.2 miles marathon, 112 miles bike race; Q15\u201316).\n\n---\n\n### **4. Professional Communication**\n#### **Emails**:\n- **Structure**:\n  - Subject line: Specific (e.g., *Letter of gratitude for job interview*; Q37).\n  - Salutation: *Dear [First Name]* (Q38\u201339; *Dr.* if applicable).\n  - Body: Concise, polite, and purpose-driven (e.g., thank-you note post-interview).\n  - Closing: *Best regards*.\n- **Key Points**:\n  - Emails are **rewritable** (not temporary) and can serve as **evidence** (Q40).\n  - Salutation followed by **comma/colon** (Q41).\n\n#### **Workplace Interactions (Police Station Context)**:\n- **Politeness Strategies**:\n  - **Reminders**: *I wanted to give you a gentle reminder* (Q36).\n  - **Invitations**: *Hi, tomorrow is my birthday... Will you be free?* (Q33).\n  - **Refusals**: *Thank you, but I must decline due to allergies* (Q34).\n  - **Requests for Help**: *Sir, would you please review this FIR?* (Q35).\n- **Avoid**:\n  - Accusatory language (*Why haven\u2019t you finished it yet?*; Q32/D).\n  - Overly casual/informal tone (*Hey bro, fix this*; Q35/B).\n\n---\n\n### **5. Literary Devices & Figurative Language**\n- **Simile**: Direct comparison using *like/as* (Q43: *dead as a doornail*).\n- **Paradox**: *Herding offers identity by melting into the crowd* (Q8).\n- **Therapeutic vs. Toxic**: Crowds as \"curative yet dangerous\" (passage analysis).\n\n---\n\n### **6. Listening Comprehension (Audio-Based Questions)**\n- **Topics Covered**:\n  - Entertainment awards (EGOT; Q12).\n  - Sports events (Ironman, marathon distances; Q14\u201316).\n  - Achievements (e.g., self-transcendence race; Q13).\n- **Skills Tested**:\n  - Extracting numerical data (e.g., 41 days for the race; Q13).\n  - Identifying synonyms (*transcendence* \u2260 *mundane*; Q17).\n\n---\n\n### **Mermaid Knowledge Graphs**\n#### **1.
