I was born into a middle-class Tamil family in the island town of Rameswaram in the erstwhile Madras State. My father, Jainulabdeen, had neither much formal education nor much wealth; despite these disadvantages, he possessed great innate wisdom and a true generosity of spirit. He had an ideal helpmate in my mother, Ashiamma. I do not recall the exact number of people she fed every day, but I am quite certain that far more outsiders ate with us than all the members of our own family put together.  I was one of many children \u2014 a short boy with rather undistinguished looks, born to tall and handsome parents. We lived in our ancestral house, which was built in the middle of the nineteenth century. It was a fairly large pucca house, made of limestone and brick, on Mosque Street in Rameswaram. My austere father used to avoid all inessential comforts and luxuries. However, all necessities were provided for, in terms of food, medicine or clothes. In fact, I would say mine was a very secure childhood, both materially and emotionally.  The Second World War broke out in 1939, when I was eight years old. For reasons I have never been able to understand, a sudden demand for tamarind seeds erupted in the market. I used to collect the seeds and sell them to a provision shop on Mosque Street. A day\u2019s collection would fetch me the princely sum of one anna. My brother-in-law Jallaluddin would tell me stories about the War which I would later attempt to trace in the headlines of Dinamani. Our area, being isolated, was completely unaffected by the war. But soon India was forced to join the Allied Forces and something like a state of emergency was declared. The first casualty came in the form of the suspension of the train halt at Rameswaram station. The newspapers now had to be bundled and thrown out from the moving train on the Rameswaram Road between Rameswaram and Dhanuskodi. That forced my cousin Samsuddin, who distributed newspapers in Rameswaram, to look for a helping hand to catch the bundles and, as if naturally, I filled the slot. Samsuddin helped me earn my first wages. Half a century later, I can still feel the surge of pride in earning my own money for the first time.  Every child is born, with some inherited characteristics, into a specific socio-economic and emotional environment, and trained in certain ways by figures of authority. I inherited honesty and self- discipline from my father; from my mother, I inherited faith in goodness and deep kindness and so did my three brothers and sister. I had three close friends in my childhood \u2014 Ramanadha Sastry, Aravindan and Sivaprakasan.  My Childhood - A.P.J Abdul Kalam",

I was born into a middle-class Tamil family in the island town of Rameswaram in the erstwhile Madras State. My father, Jainulabdeen, had neither much formal education nor much wealth; despite these disadvantages, he possessed great innate wisdom and a true generosity of spirit. He had an ideal helpmate in my mother, Ashiamma. I do not recall the exact number of people she fed every day, but I am quite certain that far more outsiders ate with us than all the members of our own family put together.  I was one of many children \u2014 a short boy with rather undistinguished looks, born to tall and handsome parents. We lived in our ancestral house, which was built in the middle of the nineteenth century. It was a fairly large pucca house, made of limestone and brick, on Mosque Street in Rameswaram. My austere father used to avoid all inessential comforts and luxuries. However, all necessities were provided for, in terms of food, medicine or clothes. In fact, I would say mine was a very secure childhood, both materially and emotionally.  The Second World War broke out in 1939, when I was eight years old. For reasons I have never been able to understand, a sudden demand for tamarind seeds erupted in the market. I used to collect the seeds and sell them to a provision shop on Mosque Street. A day\u2019s collection would fetch me the princely sum of one anna. My brother-in-law Jallaluddin would tell me stories about the War which I would later attempt to trace in the headlines of Dinamani. Our area, being isolated, was completely unaffected by the war. But soon India was forced to join the Allied Forces and something like a state of emergency was declared. The first casualty came in the form of the suspension of the train halt at Rameswaram station. The newspapers now had to be bundled and thrown out from the moving train on the Rameswaram Road between Rameswaram and Dhanuskodi. That forced my cousin Samsuddin, who distributed newspapers in Rameswaram, to look for a helping hand to catch the bundles and, as if naturally, I filled the slot. Samsuddin helped me earn my first wages. Half a century later, I can still feel the surge of pride in earning my own money for the first time.  Every child is born, with some inherited characteristics, into a specific socio-economic and emotional environment, and trained in certain ways by figures of authority. I inherited honesty and self- discipline from my father; from my mother, I inherited faith in goodness and deep kindness and so did my three brothers and sister. I had three close friends in my childhood \u2014 Ramanadha Sastry, Aravindan and Sivaprakasan.  My Childhood - A.P.J Abdul Kalam",

                            "Read the following passage and answer the given subquestions.  I was born into a middle-class Tamil family in the island town of Rameswaram in the erstwhile Madras State. My father, Jainulabdeen, had neither much formal education nor much wealth; despite these disadvantages, he possessed great innate wisdom and a true generosity of spirit. He had an ideal helpmate in my mother, Ashiamma. I do not recall the exact number of people she fed every day, but I am quite certain that far more outsiders ate with us than all the members of our own family put together.  I was one of many children \u2014 a short boy with rather undistinguished looks, born to tall and handsome parents. We lived in our ancestral house, which was built in the middle of the nineteenth century. It was a fairly large pucca house, made of limestone and brick, on Mosque Street in Rameswaram. My austere father used to avoid all inessential comforts and luxuries. However, all necessities were provided for, in terms of food, medicine or clothes. In fact, I would say mine was a very secure childhood, both materially and emotionally.  The Second World War broke out in 1939, when I was eight years old. For reasons I have never been able to understand, a sudden demand for tamarind seeds erupted in the market. I used to collect the seeds and sell them to a provision shop on Mosque Street. A day\u2019s collection would fetch me the princely sum of one anna. My brother-in-law Jallaluddin would tell me stories about the War which I would later attempt to trace in the headlines of Dinamani. Our area, being isolated, was completely unaffected by the war. But soon India was forced to join the Allied Forces and something like a state of emergency was declared. The first casualty came in the form of the suspension of the train halt at Rameswaram station. The newspapers now had to be bundled and thrown out from the moving train on the Rameswaram Road between Rameswaram and Dhanuskodi. That forced my cousin Samsuddin, who distributed newspapers in Rameswaram, to look for a helping hand to catch the bundles and, as if naturally, I filled the slot. Samsuddin helped me earn my first wages. Half a century later, I can still feel the surge of pride in earning my own money for the first time.  Every child is born, with some inherited characteristics, into a specific socio-economic and emotional environment, and trained in certain ways by figures of authority. I inherited honesty and self- discipline from my father; from my mother, I inherited faith in goodness and deep kindness and so did my three brothers and sister. I had three close friends in my childhood \u2014 Ramanadha Sastry, Aravindan and Sivaprakasan.  My Childhood - A.P.J Abdul Kalam"

I was born into a middle-class Tamil family in the island town of Rameswaram in the erstwhile Madras State. My father, Jainulabdeen, had neither much formal education nor much wealth; despite these disadvantages, he possessed great innate wisdom and a true generosity of spirit. He had an ideal helpmate in my mother, Ashiamma. I do not recall the exact number of people she fed every day, but I am quite certain that far more outsiders ate with us than all the members of our own family put together.  I was one of many children \u2014 a short boy with rather undistinguished looks, born to tall and handsome parents. We lived in our ancestral house, which was built in the middle of the nineteenth century. It was a fairly large pucca house, made of limestone and brick, on Mosque Street in Rameswaram. My austere father used to avoid all inessential comforts and luxuries. However, all necessities were provided for, in terms of food, medicine or clothes. In fact, I would say mine was a very secure childhood, both materially and emotionally.  The Second World War broke out in 1939, when I was eight years old. For reasons I have never been able to understand, a sudden demand for tamarind seeds erupted in the market. I used to collect the seeds and sell them to a provision shop on Mosque Street. A day\u2019s collection would fetch me the princely sum of one anna. My brother-in-law Jallaluddin would tell me stories about the War which I would later attempt to trace in the headlines of Dinamani. Our area, being isolated, was completely unaffected by the war. But soon India was forced to join the Allied Forces and something like a state of emergency was declared. The first casualty came in the form of the suspension of the train halt at Rameswaram station. The newspapers now had to be bundled and thrown out from the moving train on the Rameswaram Road between Rameswaram and Dhanuskodi. That forced my cousin Samsuddin, who distributed newspapers in Rameswaram, to look for a helping hand to catch the bundles and, as if naturally, I filled the slot. Samsuddin helped me earn my first wages. Half a century later, I can still feel the surge of pride in earning my own money for the first time.  Every child is born, with some inherited characteristics, into a specific socio-economic and emotional environment, and trained in certain ways by figures of authority. I inherited honesty and self- discipline from my father; from my mother, I inherited faith in goodness and deep kindness and so did my three brothers and sister. I had three close friends in my childhood \u2014 Ramanadha Sastry, Aravindan and Sivaprakasan.  My Childhood - A.P.J Abdul Kalam",

My father, Jainulabdeen, had neither much formal education nor much wealth; despite these disadvantages, he possessed great innate wisdom and a true generosity of spirit. He had an ideal helpmate in my mother, Ashiamma. I do not recall the exact number of people she fed every day, but I am quite certain that far more outsiders ate with us than all the members of our own family put together.  I was one of many children \u2014 a short boy with rather undistinguished looks, born to tall and handsome parents. We lived in our ancestral house, which was built in the middle of the nineteenth century. It was a fairly large pucca house, made of limestone and brick, on Mosque Street in Rameswaram. My austere father used to avoid all inessential comforts and luxuries. However, all necessities were provided for, in terms of food, medicine or clothes. In fact, I would say mine was a very secure childhood, both materially and emotionally.  The Second World War broke out in 1939, when I was eight years old. For reasons I have never been able to understand, a sudden demand for tamarind seeds erupted in the market. I used to collect the seeds and sell them to a provision shop on Mosque Street. A day\u2019s collection would fetch me the princely sum of one anna. My brother-in-law Jallaluddin would tell me stories about the War which I would later attempt to trace in the headlines of Dinamani. Our area, being isolated, was completely unaffected by the war. But soon India was forced to join the Allied Forces and something like a state of emergency was declared. The first casualty came in the form of the suspension of the train halt at Rameswaram station. The newspapers now had to be bundled and thrown out from the moving train on the Rameswaram Road between Rameswaram and Dhanuskodi. That forced my cousin Samsuddin, who distributed newspapers in Rameswaram, to look for a helping hand to catch the bundles and, as if naturally, I filled the slot. Samsuddin helped me earn my first wages. Half a century later, I can still feel the surge of pride in earning my own money for the first time.

That forced my cousin Samsuddin, who distributed newspapers in Rameswaram, to look for a helping hand to catch the bundles and, as if naturally, I filled the slot. Samsuddin helped me earn my first wages. Half a century later, I can still feel the surge of pride in earning my own money for the first time.  Every child is born, with some inherited characteristics, into a specific socio-economic and emotional environment, and trained in certain ways by figures of authority. I inherited honesty and self- discipline from my father; from my mother, I inherited faith in goodness and deep kindness and so did my three brothers and sister. I had three close friends in my childhood \u2014 Ramanadha Sastry, Aravindan and Sivaprakasan.  My Childhood - A.P.J Abdul Kalam"

I was born into a middle-class Tamil family in the island town of Rameswaram in the erstwhile Madras State. My father, Jainulabdeen, had neither much formal education nor much wealth; despite these disadvantages, he possessed great innate wisdom and a true generosity of spirit. He had an ideal helpmate in my mother, Ashiamma. I do not recall the exact number of people she fed every day, but I am quite certain that far more outsiders ate with us than all the members of our own family put together.  I was one of many children \u2014 a short boy with rather undistinguished looks, born to tall and handsome parents. We lived in our ancestral house, which was built in the middle of the nineteenth century. It was a fairly large pucca house, made of limestone and brick, on Mosque Street in Rameswaram. My austere father used to avoid all inessential comforts and luxuries. However, all necessities were provided for, in terms of food, medicine or clothes. In fact, I would say mine was a very secure childhood, both materially and emotionally.  The Second World War broke out in 1939, when I was eight years old. For reasons I have never been able to understand, a sudden demand for tamarind seeds erupted in the market. I used to collect the seeds and sell them to a provision shop on Mosque Street. A day\u2019s collection would fetch me the princely sum of one anna. My brother-in-law Jallaluddin would tell me stories about the War which I would later attempt to trace in the headlines of Dinamani. Our area, being isolated, was completely unaffected by the war. But soon India was forced to join the Allied Forces and something like a state of emergency was declared. The first casualty came in the form of the suspension of the train halt at Rameswaram station. The newspapers now had to be bundled and thrown out from the moving train on the Rameswaram Road between Rameswaram and Dhanuskodi.

I was born into a middle-class Tamil family in the island town of Rameswaram in the erstwhile Madras State. My father, Jainulabdeen, had neither much formal education nor much wealth; despite these disadvantages, he possessed great innate wisdom and a true generosity of spirit. He had an ideal helpmate in my mother, Ashiamma. I do not recall the exact number of people she fed every day, but I am quite certain that far more outsiders ate with us than all the members of our own family put together.  I was one of many children \u2014 a short boy with rather undistinguished looks, born to tall and handsome parents. We lived in our ancestral house, which was built in the middle of the nineteenth century. It was a fairly large pucca house, made of limestone and brick, on Mosque Street in Rameswaram. My austere father used to avoid all inessential comforts and luxuries. However, all necessities were provided for, in terms of food, medicine or clothes. In fact, I would say mine was a very secure childhood, both materially and emotionally.  The Second World War broke out in 1939, when I was eight years old. For reasons I have never been able to understand, a sudden demand for tamarind seeds erupted in the market. I used to collect the seeds and sell them to a provision shop on Mosque Street. A day\u2019s collection would fetch me the princely sum of one anna. My brother-in-law Jallaluddin would tell me stories about the War which I would later attempt to trace in the headlines of Dinamani. Our area, being isolated, was completely unaffected by the war. But soon India was forced to join the Allied Forces and something like a state of emergency was declared. The first casualty came in the form of the suspension of the train halt at Rameswaram station. The newspapers now had to be bundled and thrown out from the moving train on the Rameswaram Road between Rameswaram and Dhanuskodi. That forced my cousin Samsuddin, who distributed newspapers in Rameswaram, to look for a helping hand to catch the bundles and, as if naturally, I filled the slot. Samsuddin helped me earn my first wages. Half a century later, I can still feel the surge of pride in earning my own money for the first time.  Every child is born, with some inherited characteristics, into a specific socio-economic and emotional environment, and trained in certain ways by figures of authority. I inherited honesty and self- discipline from my father; from my mother, I inherited faith in goodness and deep kindness and so did my three brothers and sister. I had three close friends in my childhood \u2014 Ramanadha Sastry, Aravindan and Sivaprakasan.  My Childhood - A.P.J Abdul Kalam",

Go through the paragraph and answer the given subquestions that follow:   Institutional racism is (1) _____ visible in healthcare. A recent example comes from a report published by the Women and Equalities Committee, which finds that black women are almost four times more likely to die as a result of childbirth than white women. MPs behind the report have rightly denounced the government\u2019s failure to address this gulf.  The statistic is not news. Racial inequalities in maternal healthcare have been (2) _____ for at least two decades. Serena Williams recently drew attention to this phenomenon in the US when writing about the birth of her daughter. The tennis player, who was at risk of blood clots, was told when requesting a scan that medicine was making her \u201ctalk crazy\u201d. Once the scan was granted, it revealed what Ms. Williams had suspected. The clots had returned. The resistance she faced is not uncommon. Research from the US shows how racist assumptions that black patients can endure more pain have resulted in doctors being less likely to grant them adequate treatment. In Britain, black women report being denied pain relief, feeling unsafe and seeing their concerns ignored by midwives and doctors.  When politicians and parts of the media promote the idea that racism is a matter of bad apples rather than (3) _____ failures, it should be no surprise that the role of systemic racism in health is ignored. Many of the problems faced by women of colour in maternity wards are rooted in unconscious biases. Midwives still use the Apgar score, a 1952 tool that checks the health of new-borns by the colour of their skin. Textbooks and equipment are still based around white bodies: pulse oximeters are prone to inaccurate readings when gauging the oxygen levels of people with darker skin. Ethnic minority groups are underrepresented in clinical trials.  The NHS (National Health Service) founded the independent Race and Health Observatory in 2021, and local maternity services have made progress on adopting equality plans, but leadership from the top is needed to adequately address and rectify the issue. So long as politicians trivialise systemic racism and pretend that the journey towards equality is complete, the causes of these health disparities will go undiagnosed.",

When politicians and parts of the media promote the idea that racism is a matter of bad apples rather than (3) _____ failures, it should be no surprise that the role of systemic racism in health is ignored. Many of the problems faced by women of colour in maternity wards are rooted in unconscious biases. Midwives still use the Apgar score, a 1952 tool that checks the health of new-borns by the colour of their skin. Textbooks and equipment are still based around white bodies: pulse oximeters are prone to inaccurate readings when gauging the oxygen levels of people with darker skin. Ethnic minority groups are underrepresented in clinical trials.  The NHS (National Health Service) founded the independent Race and Health Observatory in 2021, and local maternity services have made progress on adopting equality plans, but leadership from the top is needed to adequately address and rectify the issue. So long as politicians trivialise systemic racism and pretend that the journey towards equality is complete, the causes of these health disparities will go undiagnosed."

MPs behind the report have rightly denounced the government\u2019s failure to address this gulf.  The statistic is not news. Racial inequalities in maternal healthcare have been (2) _____ for at least two decades. Serena Williams recently drew attention to this phenomenon in the US when writing about the birth of her daughter. The tennis player, who was at risk of blood clots, was told when requesting a scan that medicine was making her \u201ctalk crazy\u201d. Once the scan was granted, it revealed what Ms. Williams had suspected. The clots had returned. The resistance she faced is not uncommon. Research from the US shows how racist assumptions that black patients can endure more pain have resulted in doctors being less likely to grant them adequate treatment. In Britain, black women report being denied pain relief, feeling unsafe and seeing their concerns ignored by midwives and doctors.  When politicians and parts of the media promote the idea that racism is a matter of bad apples rather than (3) _____ failures, it should be no surprise that the role of systemic racism in health is ignored.

Ethnic minority groups are underrepresented in clinical trials.  The NHS (National Health Service) founded the independent Race and Health Observatory in 2021, and local maternity services have made progress on adopting equality plans, but leadership from the top is needed to adequately address and rectify the issue.

                            "Given below is a write-up from The Guardian decrying the inequalities in maternal healthcare for women of colour. Go through the paragraph and answer the given subquestions that follow:   Institutional racism is (1) _____ visible in healthcare. A recent example comes from a report published by the Women and Equalities Committee, which finds that black women are almost four times more likely to die as a result of childbirth than white women. MPs behind the report have rightly denounced the government\u2019s failure to address this gulf.  The statistic is not news. Racial inequalities in maternal healthcare have been (2) _____ for at least two decades. Serena Williams recently drew attention to this phenomenon in the US when writing about the birth of her daughter. The tennis player, who was at risk of blood clots, was told when requesting a scan that medicine was making her \u201ctalk crazy\u201d. Once the scan was granted, it revealed what Ms. Williams had suspected. The clots had returned. The resistance she faced is not uncommon. Research from the US shows how racist assumptions that black patients can endure more pain have resulted in doctors being less likely to grant them adequate treatment. In Britain, black women report being denied pain relief, feeling unsafe and seeing their concerns ignored by midwives and doctors.  When politicians and parts of the media promote the idea that racism is a matter of bad apples rather than (3) _____ failures, it should be no surprise that the role of systemic racism in health is ignored. Many of the problems faced by women of colour in maternity wards are rooted in unconscious biases. Midwives still use the Apgar score, a 1952 tool that checks the health of new-borns by the colour of their skin. Textbooks and equipment are still based around white bodies: pulse oximeters are prone to inaccurate readings when gauging the oxygen levels of people with darker skin. Ethnic minority groups are underrepresented in clinical trials.  The NHS (National Health Service) founded the independent Race and Health Observatory in 2021, and local maternity services have made progress on adopting equality plans, but leadership from the top is needed to adequately address and rectify the issue. So long as politicians trivialise systemic racism and pretend that the journey towards equality is complete, the causes of these health disparities will go undiagnosed."
