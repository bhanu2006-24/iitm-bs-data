The nature of my avocations for the last thirty years has brought me into more than ordinary contact with what would seem an interesting and somewhat singular set of men, of whom as yet nothing that I know of has ever been written:\u2014I mean the law-copyists or scriveners. I have known very many of them, professionally and privately, and if I pleased, could relate diverse histories, at which good-natured gentlemen might smile, and sentimental souls might weep. But I waive the biographies of all other scriveners for a few passages in the life of Bartleby, who was a scrivener of the strangest I ever saw or heard of. While of other law-copyists I might write the complete life, of Bartleby, nothing of that sort can be done. I believe that no materials exist for a full and satisfactory biography of this man. It is an irreparable loss to literature. Bartleby was one of those beings of whom nothing is ascertainable, except from the original sources, and in his case those are very small. What my own astonished eyes saw of Bartleby, that is all I know of him, except, indeed, one vague report which will appear in the sequel. Ere introducing the scrivener, as he first appeared to me, it is fit I make some mention of myself, my employ\u00e9es, my business, my chambers, and general surroundings; because some such description is indispensable to an adequate understanding of the chief character about to be presented.  Imprimis: I am a man who, from his youth upwards, has been filled with a profound conviction that the easiest way of life is the best. Hence, though I belong to a profession proverbially energetic and nervous, even to turbulence, at times, yet nothing of that sort have I ever suffered to invade my peace. I am one of those unambitious lawyers who never addresses a jury, or in any way draws down public applause; but in the cool tranquility of a snug retreat, do a snug business among rich men\u2019s bonds and mortgages and title-deeds. All who know me, consider me an eminently safe man. The late John Jacob Astor, a personage little given to poetic enthusiasm, had no hesitation in pronouncing my first grand point to be prudence; my next, method. I do not speak it in vanity, but simply record the fact, that I was not unemployed in my profession by the late John Jacob Astor; a name which, I admit, I love to repeat, for it hath a rounded and orbicular sound to it, and rings like unto bullion. I will freely add that I was not insensible to the late John Jacob Astor\u2019s good opinion.",

I have known very many of them, professionally and privately, and if I pleased, could relate diverse histories, at which good-natured gentlemen might smile, and sentimental souls might weep. But I waive the biographies of all other scriveners for a few passages in the life of Bartleby, who was a scrivener of the strangest I ever saw or heard of. While of other law-copyists I might write the complete life, of Bartleby, nothing of that sort can be done. I believe that no materials exist for a full and satisfactory biography of this man.

All who know me, consider me an eminently safe man. The late John Jacob Astor, a personage little given to poetic enthusiasm, had no hesitation in pronouncing my first grand point to be prudence; my next, method. I do not speak it in vanity, but simply record the fact, that I was not unemployed in my profession by the late John Jacob Astor; a name which, I admit, I love to repeat, for it hath a rounded and orbicular sound to it, and rings like unto bullion.

The nature of my avocations for the last thirty years has brought me into more than ordinary contact with what would seem an interesting and somewhat singular set of men, of whom as yet nothing that I know of has ever been written:\u2014I mean the law-copyists or scriveners. I have known very many of them, professionally and privately, and if I pleased, could relate diverse histories, at which good-natured gentlemen might smile, and sentimental souls might weep. But I waive the biographies of all other scriveners for a few passages in the life of Bartleby, who was a scrivener of the strangest I ever saw or heard of. While of other law-copyists I might write the complete life, of Bartleby, nothing of that sort can be done. I believe that no materials exist for a full and satisfactory biography of this man. It is an irreparable loss to literature. Bartleby was one of those beings of whom nothing is ascertainable, except from the original sources, and in his case those are very small. What my own astonished eyes saw of Bartleby, that is all I know of him, except, indeed, one vague report which will appear in the sequel. Ere introducing the scrivener, as he first appeared to me, it is fit I make some mention of myself, my employ\u00e9es, my business, my chambers, and general surroundings; because some such description is indispensable to an adequate understanding of the chief character about to be presented.  Imprimis: I am a man who, from his youth upwards, has been filled with a profound conviction that the easiest way of life is the best. Hence, though I belong to a profession proverbially energetic and nervous, even to turbulence, at times, yet nothing of that sort have I ever suffered to invade my peace. I am one of those unambitious lawyers who never addresses a jury, or in any way draws down public applause; but in the cool tranquility of a snug retreat, do a snug business among rich men\u2019s bonds and mortgages and title-deeds. All who know me, consider me an eminently safe man. The late John Jacob Astor, a personage little given to poetic enthusiasm, had no hesitation in pronouncing my first grand point to be prudence; my next, method. I do not speak it in vanity, but simply record the fact, that I was not unemployed in my profession by the late John Jacob Astor; a name which, I admit, I love to repeat, for it hath a rounded and orbicular sound to it, and rings like unto bullion. I will freely add that I was not insensible to the late John Jacob Astor\u2019s good opinion."

I have known very many of them, professionally and privately, and if I pleased, could relate diverse histories, at which good-natured gentlemen might smile, and sentimental souls might weep.

The late John Jacob Astor, a personage little given to poetic enthusiasm, had no hesitation in pronouncing my first grand point to be prudence; my next, method. I do not speak it in vanity, but simply record the fact, that I was not unemployed in my profession by the late John Jacob Astor; a name which, I admit, I love to repeat, for it hath a rounded and orbicular sound to it, and rings like unto bullion.

The late John Jacob Astor, a personage little given to poetic enthusiasm, had no hesitation in pronouncing my first grand point to be prudence; my next, method. I do not speak it in vanity, but simply record the fact, that I was not unemployed in my profession by the late John Jacob Astor; a name which, I admit, I love to repeat, for it hath a rounded and orbicular sound to it, and rings like unto bullion.

While of other law-copyists I might write the complete life, of Bartleby, nothing of that sort can be done. I believe that no materials exist for a full and satisfactory biography of this man. It is an irreparable loss to literature. Bartleby was one of those beings of whom nothing is ascertainable, except from the original sources, and in his case those are very small. What my own astonished eyes saw of Bartleby, that is all I know of him, except, indeed, one vague report which will appear in the sequel. Ere introducing the scrivener, as he first appeared to me, it is fit I make some mention of myself, my employ\u00e9es, my business, my chambers, and general surroundings; because some such description is indispensable to an adequate understanding of the chief character about to be presented.  Imprimis: I am a man who, from his youth upwards, has been filled with a profound conviction that the easiest way of life is the best. Hence, though I belong to a profession proverbially energetic and nervous, even to turbulence, at times, yet nothing of that sort have I ever suffered to invade my peace. I am one of those unambitious lawyers who never addresses a jury, or in any way draws down public applause; but in the cool tranquility of a snug retreat, do a snug business among rich men\u2019s bonds and mortgages and title-deeds. All who know me, consider me an eminently safe man. The late John Jacob Astor, a personage little given to poetic enthusiasm, had no hesitation in pronouncing my first grand point to be prudence; my next, method. I do not speak it in vanity, but simply record the fact, that I was not unemployed in my profession by the late John Jacob Astor; a name which, I admit, I love to repeat, for it hath a rounded and orbicular sound to it, and rings like unto bullion. I will freely add that I was not insensible to the late John Jacob Astor\u2019s good opinion."

I have known very many of them, professionally and privately, and if I pleased, could relate diverse histories, at which good-natured gentlemen might smile, and sentimental souls might weep. But I waive the biographies of all other scriveners for a few passages in the life of Bartleby, who was a scrivener of the strangest I ever saw or heard of. While of other law-copyists I might write the complete life, of Bartleby, nothing of that sort can be done. I believe that no materials exist for a full and satisfactory biography of this man.

All who know me, consider me an eminently safe man. The late John Jacob Astor, a personage little given to poetic enthusiasm, had no hesitation in pronouncing my first grand point to be prudence; my next, method. I do not speak it in vanity, but simply record the fact, that I was not unemployed in my profession by the late John Jacob Astor; a name which, I admit, I love to repeat, for it hath a rounded and orbicular sound to it, and rings like unto bullion.

How can I help you today? Sophomore Student (Alex): Good morning, Professor Adams! I hope you're doing well. I wanted to talk to you about the possibility of becoming your teaching assistant for this semester. I've always enjoyed your history classes, and I think being your TA would be a fantastic experience.  Professor Adams: Hello, Alex! I appreciate your interest in becoming my TA. It's great to hear that you've enjoyed the classes so far. Before we proceed, could you tell me a bit about your passion for history and your background in the subject?  Alex: Certainly! I've been passionate about history since high school. I find it captivating to explore how the past has shaped our present. In college, I'm majoring in History, and I've taken various history courses to expand my knowledge. Last semester, I took your \"Ancient Civilizations\" class, and it was one of the highlights of my studies.  Professor Adams: I'm delighted to hear that you're enthusiastic about history, Alex. Having a genuine interest in the subject is crucial when considering a TA position. Being a TA comes with responsibilities like assisting in class activities and supporting students. Do you have any previous experiences or skills that you think would be helpful in this role?  Alex: Yes, I do! In high school, I volunteered as a history tutor, helping my classmates with their assignments and studying for exams. At college, I've also been part of the History Club, where I collaborated on organizing events and discussions related to historical topics. Moreover, I'm well-organized and a good communicator, which I believe would be beneficial as a TA.  Professor Adams: Those experiences are impressive, Alex. Your tutoring background and involvement in the History Club show that you're committed to helping others learn. Being organized and having good communication skills are essential for a TA. Collaboration is also crucial, as you'll be working closely with other TAs and me. How do you handle teamwork and maintaining a positive classroom environment?  Alex: I believe teamwork is vital in any educational setting. I enjoy collaborating with others to achieve common goals. In the classroom, I would encourage active participation from students and ensure everyone feels included and valued. If any issues arise, I would address them respectfully and try to find solutions that benefit everyone.  Professor Adams: That's a commendable approach, Alex. Fostering a positive and inclusive learning environment is essential for students' growth. Your willingness to address conflicts amicably is valuable too. Before we move forward, do you have any particular historical periods or topics that interest you the most, and would you be interested in leading discussions on those topics?  Alex: I'm particularly interested in the Renaissance period and World War II. Those topics have always fascinated me, and I'd love the chance to lead discussions on them. However, I'm open to contributing to any topic you think would be beneficial for the class.  Professor Adams: Your interest in the Renaissance and World War II aligns well with some of the topics we cover in this semester's curriculum. Leading discussions on subjects you're passionate about can be enriching for the class. I believe you have the potential to be a valuable teaching assistant, Alex. Let's move forward with the process. I'll need you to complete a formal application, including a brief statement about your motivation to be a TA. Once that's done, we'll schedule an interview to discuss further details.  Alex: Thank you, Professor Adams! I'm thrilled about this opportunity and will complete the application as soon as possible. I truly appreciate your consideration, and I'm looking forward to the interview.  Professor Adams: You're welcome, Alex. Take your time with the application, and if you have any questions along the way, feel free to reach out. I'm excited about the possibility of working together. Have a wonderful day!  Alex: Thank you, Professor Adams! I'll make sure to reach out if I need any guidance. I'm eager to contribute to the class and support my fellow students' learning. Have a great day too!

How can I help you today? Sophomore Student (Alex): Good morning, Professor Adams! I hope you're doing well. I wanted to talk to you about the possibility of becoming your teaching assistant for this semester. I've always enjoyed your history classes, and I think being your TA would be a fantastic experience.  Professor Adams: Hello, Alex! I appreciate your interest in becoming my TA. It's great to hear that you've enjoyed the classes so far. Before we proceed, could you tell me a bit about your passion for history and your background in the subject?  Alex: Certainly! I've been passionate about history since high school. I find it captivating to explore how the past has shaped our present. In college, I'm majoring in History, and I've taken various history courses to expand my knowledge. Last semester, I took your \"Ancient Civilizations\" class, and it was one of the highlights of my studies.  Professor Adams: I'm delighted to hear that you're enthusiastic about history, Alex. Having a genuine interest in the subject is crucial when considering a TA position. Being a TA comes with responsibilities like assisting in class activities and supporting students. Do you have any previous experiences or skills that you think would be helpful in this role?  Alex: Yes, I do! In high school, I volunteered as a history tutor, helping my classmates with their assignments and studying for exams. At college, I've also been part of the History Club, where I collaborated on organizing events and discussions related to historical topics. Moreover, I'm well-organized and a good communicator, which I believe would be beneficial as a TA.  Professor Adams: Those experiences are impressive, Alex. Your tutoring background and involvement in the History Club show that you're committed to helping others learn. Being organized and having good communication skills are essential for a TA. Collaboration is also crucial, as you'll be working closely with other TAs and me. How do you handle teamwork and maintaining a positive classroom environment?  Alex: I believe teamwork is vital in any educational setting. I enjoy collaborating with others to achieve common goals. In the classroom, I would encourage active participation from students and ensure everyone feels included and valued. If any issues arise, I would address them respectfully and try to find solutions that benefit everyone.  Professor Adams: That's a commendable approach, Alex. Fostering a positive and inclusive learning environment is essential for students' growth. Your willingness to address conflicts amicably is valuable too. Before we move forward, do you have any particular historical periods or topics that interest you the most, and would you be interested in leading discussions on those topics?  Alex: I'm particularly interested in the Renaissance period and World War II. Those topics have always fascinated me, and I'd love the chance to lead discussions on them. However, I'm open to contributing to any topic you think would be beneficial for the class.  Professor Adams: Your interest in the Renaissance and World War II aligns well with some of the topics we cover in this semester's curriculum. Leading discussions on subjects you're passionate about can be enriching for the class. I believe you have the potential to be a valuable teaching assistant, Alex. Let's move forward with the process. I'll need you to complete a formal application, including a brief statement about your motivation to be a TA. Once that's done, we'll schedule an interview to discuss further details.  Alex: Thank you, Professor Adams! I'm thrilled about this opportunity and will complete the application as soon as possible. I truly appreciate your consideration, and I'm looking forward to the interview.  Professor Adams: You're welcome, Alex. Take your time with the application, and if you have any questions along the way, feel free to reach out. I'm excited about the possibility of working together. Have a wonderful day!  Alex: Thank you, Professor Adams! I'll make sure to reach out if I need any guidance. I'm eager to contribute to the class and support my fellow students' learning. Have a great day too!

How can I help you today? Sophomore Student (Alex): Good morning, Professor Adams! I hope you're doing well. I wanted to talk to you about the possibility of becoming your teaching assistant for this semester. I've always enjoyed your history classes, and I think being your TA would be a fantastic experience.  Professor Adams: Hello, Alex! I appreciate your interest in becoming my TA. It's great to hear that you've enjoyed the classes so far. Before we proceed, could you tell me a bit about your passion for history and your background in the subject?  Alex: Certainly! I've been passionate about history since high school. I find it captivating to explore how the past has shaped our present. In college, I'm majoring in History, and I've taken various history courses to expand my knowledge. Last semester, I took your \"Ancient Civilizations\" class, and it was one of the highlights of my studies.  Professor Adams: I'm delighted to hear that you're enthusiastic about history, Alex. Having a genuine interest in the subject is crucial when considering a TA position. Being a TA comes with responsibilities like assisting in class activities and supporting students. Do you have any previous experiences or skills that you think would be helpful in this role?  Alex: Yes, I do! In high school, I volunteered as a history tutor, helping my classmates with their assignments and studying for exams. At college, I've also been part of the History Club, where I collaborated on organizing events and discussions related to historical topics. Moreover, I'm well-organized and a good communicator, which I believe would be beneficial as a TA.  Professor Adams: Those experiences are impressive, Alex. Your tutoring background and involvement in the History Club show that you're committed to helping others learn. Being organized and having good communication skills are essential for a TA. Collaboration is also crucial, as you'll be working closely with other TAs and me. How do you handle teamwork and maintaining a positive classroom environment?  Alex: I believe teamwork is vital in any educational setting. I enjoy collaborating with others to achieve common goals. In the classroom, I would encourage active participation from students and ensure everyone feels included and valued. If any issues arise, I would address them respectfully and try to find solutions that benefit everyone.  Professor Adams: That's a commendable approach, Alex. Fostering a positive and inclusive learning environment is essential for students' growth. Your willingness to address conflicts amicably is valuable too. Before we move forward, do you have any particular historical periods or topics that interest you the most, and would you be interested in leading discussions on those topics?  Alex: I'm particularly interested in the Renaissance period and World War II. Those topics have always fascinated me, and I'd love the chance to lead discussions on them. However, I'm open to contributing to any topic you think would be beneficial for the class.  Professor Adams: Your interest in the Renaissance and World War II aligns well with some of the topics we cover in this semester's curriculum. Leading discussions on subjects you're passionate about can be enriching for the class. I believe you have the potential to be a valuable teaching assistant, Alex. Let's move forward with the process. I'll need you to complete a formal application, including a brief statement about your motivation to be a TA. Once that's done, we'll schedule an interview to discuss further details.  Alex: Thank you, Professor Adams! I'm thrilled about this opportunity and will complete the application as soon as possible. I truly appreciate your consideration, and I'm looking forward to the interview.  Professor Adams: You're welcome, Alex. Take your time with the application, and if you have any questions along the way, feel free to reach out. I'm excited about the possibility of working together. Have a wonderful day!  Alex: Thank you, Professor Adams! I'll make sure to reach out if I need any guidance. I'm eager to contribute to the class and support my fellow students' learning. Have a great day too!

How can I help you today? Sophomore Student (Alex): Good morning, Professor Adams! I hope you're doing well. I wanted to talk to you about the possibility of becoming your teaching assistant for this semester. I've always enjoyed your history classes, and I think being your TA would be a fantastic experience.  Professor Adams: Hello, Alex! I appreciate your interest in becoming my TA. It's great to hear that you've enjoyed the classes so far. Before we proceed, could you tell me a bit about your passion for history and your background in the subject?  Alex: Certainly! I've been passionate about history since high school. I find it captivating to explore how the past has shaped our present. In college, I'm majoring in History, and I've taken various history courses to expand my knowledge. Last semester, I took your \"Ancient Civilizations\" class, and it was one of the highlights of my studies.  Professor Adams: I'm delighted to hear that you're enthusiastic about history, Alex. Having a genuine interest in the subject is crucial when considering a TA position. Being a TA comes with responsibilities like assisting in class activities and supporting students. Do you have any previous experiences or skills that you think would be helpful in this role?  Alex: Yes, I do! In high school, I volunteered as a history tutor, helping my classmates with their assignments and studying for exams. At college, I've also been part of the History Club, where I collaborated on organizing events and discussions related to historical topics. Moreover, I'm well-organized and a good communicator, which I believe would be beneficial as a TA.  Professor Adams: Those experiences are impressive, Alex. Your tutoring background and involvement in the History Club show that you're committed to helping others learn. Being organized and having good communication skills are essential for a TA. Collaboration is also crucial, as you'll be working closely with other TAs and me. How do you handle teamwork and maintaining a positive classroom environment?  Alex: I believe teamwork is vital in any educational setting. I enjoy collaborating with others to achieve common goals. In the classroom, I would encourage active participation from students and ensure everyone feels included and valued. If any issues arise, I would address them respectfully and try to find solutions that benefit everyone.  Professor Adams: That's a commendable approach, Alex. Fostering a positive and inclusive learning environment is essential for students' growth. Your willingness to address conflicts amicably is valuable too. Before we move forward, do you have any particular historical periods or topics that interest you the most, and would you be interested in leading discussions on those topics?  Alex: I'm particularly interested in the Renaissance period and World War II. Those topics have always fascinated me, and I'd love the chance to lead discussions on them. However, I'm open to contributing to any topic you think would be beneficial for the class.  Professor Adams: Your interest in the Renaissance and World War II aligns well with some of the topics we cover in this semester's curriculum. Leading discussions on subjects you're passionate about can be enriching for the class. I believe you have the potential to be a valuable teaching assistant, Alex. Let's move forward with the process. I'll need you to complete a formal application, including a brief statement about your motivation to be a TA. Once that's done, we'll schedule an interview to discuss further details.  Alex: Thank you, Professor Adams! I'm thrilled about this opportunity and will complete the application as soon as possible. I truly appreciate your consideration, and I'm looking forward to the interview.  Professor Adams: You're welcome, Alex. Take your time with the application, and if you have any questions along the way, feel free to reach out. I'm excited about the possibility of working together. Have a wonderful day!  Alex: Thank you, Professor Adams! I'll make sure to reach out if I need any guidance. I'm eager to contribute to the class and support my fellow students' learning. Have a great day too!

                            "Read the following exchange between a student and a professor and answer the given subquestions:  Professor Adams: Good morning, Alex! How can I help you today? Sophomore Student (Alex): Good morning, Professor Adams! I hope you're doing well. I wanted to talk to you about the possibility of becoming your teaching assistant for this semester. I've always enjoyed your history classes, and I think being your TA would be a fantastic experience.  Professor Adams: Hello, Alex! I appreciate your interest in becoming my TA. It's great to hear that you've enjoyed the classes so far. Before we proceed, could you tell me a bit about your passion for history and your background in the subject?  Alex: Certainly! I've been passionate about history since high school. I find it captivating to explore how the past has shaped our present. In college, I'm majoring in History, and I've taken various history courses to expand my knowledge. Last semester, I took your \"Ancient Civilizations\" class, and it was one of the highlights of my studies.  Professor Adams: I'm delighted to hear that you're enthusiastic about history, Alex. Having a genuine interest in the subject is crucial when considering a TA position. Being a TA comes with responsibilities like assisting in class activities and supporting students. Do you have any previous experiences or skills that you think would be helpful in this role?  Alex: Yes, I do! In high school, I volunteered as a history tutor, helping my classmates with their assignments and studying for exams. At college, I've also been part of the History Club, where I collaborated on organizing events and discussions related to historical topics. Moreover, I'm well-organized and a good communicator, which I believe would be beneficial as a TA.  Professor Adams: Those experiences are impressive, Alex. Your tutoring background and involvement in the History Club show that you're committed to helping others learn. Being organized and having good communication skills are essential for a TA. Collaboration is also crucial, as you'll be working closely with other TAs and me. How do you handle teamwork and maintaining a positive classroom environment?  Alex: I believe teamwork is vital in any educational setting. I enjoy collaborating with others to achieve common goals. In the classroom, I would encourage active participation from students and ensure everyone feels included and valued. If any issues arise, I would address them respectfully and try to find solutions that benefit everyone.  Professor Adams: That's a commendable approach, Alex. Fostering a positive and inclusive learning environment is essential for students' growth. Your willingness to address conflicts amicably is valuable too. Before we move forward, do you have any particular historical periods or topics that interest you the most, and would you be interested in leading discussions on those topics?  Alex: I'm particularly interested in the Renaissance period and World War II. Those topics have always fascinated me, and I'd love the chance to lead discussions on them. However, I'm open to contributing to any topic you think would be beneficial for the class.  Professor Adams: Your interest in the Renaissance and World War II aligns well with some of the topics we cover in this semester's curriculum. Leading discussions on subjects you're passionate about can be enriching for the class. I believe you have the potential to be a valuable teaching assistant, Alex. Let's move forward with the process. I'll need you to complete a formal application, including a brief statement about your motivation to be a TA.

                            "Read the following exchange between a student and a professor and answer the given subquestions:  Professor Adams: Good morning, Alex! How can I help you today? Sophomore Student (Alex): Good morning, Professor Adams! I hope you're doing well. I wanted to talk to you about the possibility of becoming your teaching assistant for this semester. I've always enjoyed your history classes, and I think being your TA would be a fantastic experience.  Professor Adams: Hello, Alex! I appreciate your interest in becoming my TA. It's great to hear that you've enjoyed the classes so far. Before we proceed, could you tell me a bit about your passion for history and your background in the subject?  Alex: Certainly! I've been passionate about history since high school. I find it captivating to explore how the past has shaped our present. In college, I'm majoring in History, and I've taken various history courses to expand my knowledge. Last semester, I took your \"Ancient Civilizations\" class, and it was one of the highlights of my studies.  Professor Adams: I'm delighted to hear that you're enthusiastic about history, Alex. Having a genuine interest in the subject is crucial when considering a TA position. Being a TA comes with responsibilities like assisting in class activities and supporting students. Do you have any previous experiences or skills that you think would be helpful in this role?  Alex: Yes, I do! In high school, I volunteered as a history tutor, helping my classmates with their assignments and studying for exams. At college, I've also been part of the History Club, where I collaborated on organizing events and discussions related to historical topics. Moreover, I'm well-organized and a good communicator, which I believe would be beneficial as a TA.  Professor Adams: Those experiences are impressive, Alex. Your tutoring background and involvement in the History Club show that you're committed to helping others learn. Being organized and having good communication skills are essential for a TA. Collaboration is also crucial, as you'll be working closely with other TAs and me. How do you handle teamwork and maintaining a positive classroom environment?  Alex: I believe teamwork is vital in any educational setting. I enjoy collaborating with others to achieve common goals. In the classroom, I would encourage active participation from students and ensure everyone feels included and valued. If any issues arise, I would address them respectfully and try to find solutions that benefit everyone.  Professor Adams: That's a commendable approach, Alex. Fostering a positive and inclusive learning environment is essential for students' growth. Your willingness to address conflicts amicably is valuable too. Before we move forward, do you have any particular historical periods or topics that interest you the most, and would you be interested in leading discussions on those topics?  Alex: I'm particularly interested in the Renaissance period and World War II. Those topics have always fascinated me, and I'd love the chance to lead discussions on them. However, I'm open to contributing to any topic you think would be beneficial for the class.  Professor Adams: Your interest in the Renaissance and World War II aligns well with some of the topics we cover in this semester's curriculum. Leading discussions on subjects you're passionate about can be enriching for the class. I believe you have the potential to be a valuable teaching assistant, Alex. Let's move forward with the process. I'll need you to complete a formal application, including a brief statement about your motivation to be a TA. Once that's done, we'll schedule an interview to discuss further details.  Alex: Thank you, Professor Adams! I'm thrilled about this opportunity and will complete the application as soon as possible. I truly appreciate your consideration, and I'm looking forward to the interview.  Professor Adams: You're welcome, Alex. Take your time with the application, and if you have any questions along the way, feel free to reach out. I'm excited about the possibility of working together. Have a wonderful day!  Alex: Thank you, Professor Adams! I'll make sure to reach out if I need any guidance. I'm eager to contribute to the class and support my fellow students' learning. Have a great day too!  Professor Adams: You too, Alex. Take care, and I'll be in touch soon. Goodbye for now!"

How can I help you today? Sophomore Student (Alex): Good morning, Professor Adams! I hope you're doing well. I wanted to talk to you about the possibility of becoming your teaching assistant for this semester. I've always enjoyed your history classes, and I think being your TA would be a fantastic experience.  Professor Adams: Hello, Alex! I appreciate your interest in becoming my TA. It's great to hear that you've enjoyed the classes so far. Before we proceed, could you tell me a bit about your passion for history and your background in the subject?  Alex: Certainly! I've been passionate about history since high school. I find it captivating to explore how the past has shaped our present. In college, I'm majoring in History, and I've taken various history courses to expand my knowledge. Last semester, I took your \"Ancient Civilizations\" class, and it was one of the highlights of my studies.  Professor Adams: I'm delighted to hear that you're enthusiastic about history, Alex. Having a genuine interest in the subject is crucial when considering a TA position. Being a TA comes with responsibilities like assisting in class activities and supporting students. Do you have any previous experiences or skills that you think would be helpful in this role?  Alex: Yes, I do! In high school, I volunteered as a history tutor, helping my classmates with their assignments and studying for exams. At college, I've also been part of the History Club, where I collaborated on organizing events and discussions related to historical topics. Moreover, I'm well-organized and a good communicator, which I believe would be beneficial as a TA.  Professor Adams: Those experiences are impressive, Alex. Your tutoring background and involvement in the History Club show that you're committed to helping others learn. Being organized and having good communication skills are essential for a TA. Collaboration is also crucial, as you'll be working closely with other TAs and me. How do you handle teamwork and maintaining a positive classroom environment?  Alex: I believe teamwork is vital in any educational setting. I enjoy collaborating with others to achieve common goals. In the classroom, I would encourage active participation from students and ensure everyone feels included and valued. If any issues arise, I would address them respectfully and try to find solutions that benefit everyone.  Professor Adams: That's a commendable approach, Alex. Fostering a positive and inclusive learning environment is essential for students' growth. Your willingness to address conflicts amicably is valuable too. Before we move forward, do you have any particular historical periods or topics that interest you the most, and would you be interested in leading discussions on those topics?  Alex: I'm particularly interested in the Renaissance period and World War II. Those topics have always fascinated me, and I'd love the chance to lead discussions on them. However, I'm open to contributing to any topic you think would be beneficial for the class.  Professor Adams: Your interest in the Renaissance and World War II aligns well with some of the topics we cover in this semester's curriculum. Leading discussions on subjects you're passionate about can be enriching for the class. I believe you have the potential to be a valuable teaching assistant, Alex.

How can I help you today? Sophomore Student (Alex): Good morning, Professor Adams! I hope you're doing well. I wanted to talk to you about the possibility of becoming your teaching assistant for this semester. I've always enjoyed your history classes, and I think being your TA would be a fantastic experience.  Professor Adams: Hello, Alex! I appreciate your interest in becoming my TA. It's great to hear that you've enjoyed the classes so far. Before we proceed, could you tell me a bit about your passion for history and your background in the subject?  Alex: Certainly! I've been passionate about history since high school. I find it captivating to explore how the past has shaped our present. In college, I'm majoring in History, and I've taken various history courses to expand my knowledge. Last semester, I took your \"Ancient Civilizations\" class, and it was one of the highlights of my studies.  Professor Adams: I'm delighted to hear that you're enthusiastic about history, Alex. Having a genuine interest in the subject is crucial when considering a TA position. Being a TA comes with responsibilities like assisting in class activities and supporting students. Do you have any previous experiences or skills that you think would be helpful in this role?  Alex: Yes, I do! In high school, I volunteered as a history tutor, helping my classmates with their assignments and studying for exams. At college, I've also been part of the History Club, where I collaborated on organizing events and discussions related to historical topics. Moreover, I'm well-organized and a good communicator, which I believe would be beneficial as a TA.  Professor Adams: Those experiences are impressive, Alex. Your tutoring background and involvement in the History Club show that you're committed to helping others learn. Being organized and having good communication skills are essential for a TA. Collaboration is also crucial, as you'll be working closely with other TAs and me. How do you handle teamwork and maintaining a positive classroom environment?  Alex: I believe teamwork is vital in any educational setting. I enjoy collaborating with others to achieve common goals. In the classroom, I would encourage active participation from students and ensure everyone feels included and valued. If any issues arise, I would address them respectfully and try to find solutions that benefit everyone.  Professor Adams: That's a commendable approach, Alex. Fostering a positive and inclusive learning environment is essential for students' growth. Your willingness to address conflicts amicably is valuable too. Before we move forward, do you have any particular historical periods or topics that interest you the most, and would you be interested in leading discussions on those topics?  Alex: I'm particularly interested in the Renaissance period and World War II. Those topics have always fascinated me, and I'd love the chance to lead discussions on them. However, I'm open to contributing to any topic you think would be beneficial for the class.  Professor Adams: Your interest in the Renaissance and World War II aligns well with some of the topics we cover in this semester's curriculum. Leading discussions on subjects you're passionate about can be enriching for the class. I believe you have the potential to be a valuable teaching assistant, Alex. Let's move forward with the process. I'll need you to complete a formal application, including a brief statement about your motivation to be a TA. Once that's done, we'll schedule an interview to discuss further details.  Alex: Thank you, Professor Adams! I'm thrilled about this opportunity and will complete the application as soon as possible. I truly appreciate your consideration, and I'm looking forward to the interview.  Professor Adams: You're welcome, Alex. Take your time with the application, and if you have any questions along the way, feel free to reach out. I'm excited about the possibility of working together. Have a wonderful day!  Alex: Thank you, Professor Adams! I'll make sure to reach out if I need any guidance. I'm eager to contribute to the class and support my fellow students' learning. Have a great day too!  Professor Adams: You too, Alex. Take care, and I'll be in touch soon. Goodbye for now!",

How can I help you today? Sophomore Student (Alex): Good morning, Professor Adams! I hope you're doing well. I wanted to talk to you about the possibility of becoming your teaching assistant for this semester. I've always enjoyed your history classes, and I think being your TA would be a fantastic experience.  Professor Adams: Hello, Alex! I appreciate your interest in becoming my TA. It's great to hear that you've enjoyed the classes so far. Before we proceed, could you tell me a bit about your passion for history and your background in the subject?  Alex: Certainly! I've been passionate about history since high school. I find it captivating to explore how the past has shaped our present. In college, I'm majoring in History, and I've taken various history courses to expand my knowledge. Last semester, I took your \"Ancient Civilizations\" class, and it was one of the highlights of my studies.  Professor Adams: I'm delighted to hear that you're enthusiastic about history, Alex. Having a genuine interest in the subject is crucial when considering a TA position. Being a TA comes with responsibilities like assisting in class activities and supporting students. Do you have any previous experiences or skills that you think would be helpful in this role?  Alex: Yes, I do! In high school, I volunteered as a history tutor, helping my classmates with their assignments and studying for exams. At college, I've also been part of the History Club, where I collaborated on organizing events and discussions related to historical topics. Moreover, I'm well-organized and a good communicator, which I believe would be beneficial as a TA.  Professor Adams: Those experiences are impressive, Alex. Your tutoring background and involvement in the History Club show that you're committed to helping others learn. Being organized and having good communication skills are essential for a TA. Collaboration is also crucial, as you'll be working closely with other TAs and me. How do you handle teamwork and maintaining a positive classroom environment?  Alex: I believe teamwork is vital in any educational setting. I enjoy collaborating with others to achieve common goals. In the classroom, I would encourage active participation from students and ensure everyone feels included and valued. If any issues arise, I would address them respectfully and try to find solutions that benefit everyone.  Professor Adams: That's a commendable approach, Alex. Fostering a positive and inclusive learning environment is essential for students' growth. Your willingness to address conflicts amicably is valuable too. Before we move forward, do you have any particular historical periods or topics that interest you the most, and would you be interested in leading discussions on those topics?  Alex: I'm particularly interested in the Renaissance period and World War II. Those topics have always fascinated me, and I'd love the chance to lead discussions on them. However, I'm open to contributing to any topic you think would be beneficial for the class.  Professor Adams: Your interest in the Renaissance and World War II aligns well with some of the topics we cover in this semester's curriculum. Leading discussions on subjects you're passionate about can be enriching for the class. I believe you have the potential to be a valuable teaching assistant, Alex. Let's move forward with the process. I'll need you to complete a formal application, including a brief statement about your motivation to be a TA. Once that's done, we'll schedule an interview to discuss further details.  Alex: Thank you, Professor Adams! I'm thrilled about this opportunity and will complete the application as soon as possible. I truly appreciate your consideration, and I'm looking forward to the interview.  Professor Adams: You're welcome, Alex. Take your time with the application, and if you have any questions along the way, feel free to reach out. I'm excited about the possibility of working together. Have a wonderful day!

Objective: To make dal tadka and use the dhungar method to incorporate a smoky flavour into the dish.  Method:  i. Thoroughly (1) _____ 1 cup of split and husked pigeon pea lentils (toor dal) in water. Add it to a pressure cooker. ii. Add half a cup of chopped onions, one cup of finely chopped tomatoes, 1 or 2 green chilies and 1 teaspoon of finely chopped ginger to the pressure cooker. iii. Pour 2.5 cups of water into the pressure cooker. iv. Add half a teaspoon of turmeric powder and 1 pinch of asafoetida. v. Mix well and pressure cook the lentils for about 7-8 whistles over medium heat. vi. Open the pressure cooker once the pressure has been released. The lentils would have become soft and creamy. vii. (2) _____ the cooked lentils with a wired whisk or a spoon. If the consistency looks too thick, add about half to one cup of water and simmer the dal for 3 to 4 minutes. viii. Once the desired consistency is reached, add half a teaspoon of garam masala powder, two tablespoons of chopped coriander leaves and salt to taste. ix. (3) _____ off the heat. x. Mix well and (4) _____ the salt level before adding the tempering. xi. To smoke the lentils using the dhungar method, burn a small piece of charcoal on a grill till it becomes red hot. xii. Using tongs, (5) _____ the piece of charcoal in a small steel bowl or the hollowed-out half of an onion. xiii. Use only natural charcoal. Avoid anything that has a flame accelerant added. xiv. Pour about a quarter teaspoon of oil or ghee on the charcoal. xv. Fumes emanate from the hot charcoal as soon as oil or ghee is poured on it. xvi. Place the charcoal bowl on the dal. xvii. Cover the pressure cooker with its lid and let the smoke be infused into the dal for a minute or two. xviii. Smoking the dal for longer runs the risk of making the dal bitter. xix. Remove the bowl carefully with the help of tongs and cover the pressure cooker with its lid. xx. Heat 3 tablespoons of oil or ghee (clarified butter) in a small pan over low-medium heat. xxi. Crackle 1 teaspoon of cumin seeds in the oil/ghee. xxii. Add 2 to 3 dry red chilies, a generous pinch of asafoetida, and 5-6 finely chopped medium sized garlic cloves. xxiii. When the garlic has browned lightly and the red chilies have changed colour, add 1 teaspoon of crushed kasuri methi and half a teaspoon of red chilli powder. xxiv. Mix well and turn off the stove. xxv. Pour the tempering, along with the oil/ghee, into the dal. xxvi. Garnish with coriander leaves."

Objective: To make dal tadka and use the dhungar method to incorporate a smoky flavour into the dish.  Method:  i. Thoroughly (1) _____ 1 cup of split and husked pigeon pea lentils (toor dal) in water. Add it to a pressure cooker. ii. Add half a cup of chopped onions, one cup of finely chopped tomatoes, 1 or 2 green chilies and 1 teaspoon of finely chopped ginger to the pressure cooker. iii. Pour 2.5 cups of water into the pressure cooker. iv. Add half a teaspoon of turmeric powder and 1 pinch of asafoetida. v. Mix well and pressure cook the lentils for about 7-8 whistles over medium heat. vi. Open the pressure cooker once the pressure has been released. The lentils would have become soft and creamy. vii. (2) _____ the cooked lentils with a wired whisk or a spoon. If the consistency looks too thick, add about half to one cup of water and simmer the dal for 3 to 4 minutes. viii. Once the desired consistency is reached, add half a teaspoon of garam masala powder, two tablespoons of chopped coriander leaves and salt to taste. ix. (3) _____ off the heat. x. Mix well and (4) _____ the salt level before adding the tempering. xi. To smoke the lentils using the dhungar method, burn a small piece of charcoal on a grill till it becomes red hot. xii. Using tongs, (5) _____ the piece of charcoal in a small steel bowl or the hollowed-out half of an onion. xiii. Use only natural charcoal. Avoid anything that has a flame accelerant added. xiv. Pour about a quarter teaspoon of oil or ghee on the charcoal. xv. Fumes emanate from the hot charcoal as soon as oil or ghee is poured on it. xvi. Place the charcoal bowl on the dal. xvii. Cover the pressure cooker with its lid and let the smoke be infused into the dal for a minute or two. xviii. Smoking the dal for longer runs the risk of making the dal bitter. xix. Remove the bowl carefully with the help of tongs and cover the pressure cooker with its lid. xx. Heat 3 tablespoons of oil or ghee (clarified butter) in a small pan over low-medium heat. xxi. Crackle 1 teaspoon of cumin seeds in the oil/ghee. xxii. Add 2 to 3 dry red chilies, a generous pinch of asafoetida, and 5-6 finely chopped medium sized garlic cloves. xxiii. When the garlic has browned lightly and the red chilies have changed colour, add 1 teaspoon of crushed kasuri methi and half a teaspoon of red chilli powder. xxiv. Mix well and turn off the stove. xxv. Pour the tempering, along with the oil/ghee, into the dal. xxvi. Garnish with coriander leaves.",

Objective: To make dal tadka and use the dhungar method to incorporate a smoky flavour into the dish.  Method:  i. Thoroughly (1) _____ 1 cup of split and husked pigeon pea lentils (toor dal) in water. Add it to a pressure cooker. ii. Add half a cup of chopped onions, one cup of finely chopped tomatoes, 1 or 2 green chilies and 1 teaspoon of finely chopped ginger to the pressure cooker. iii. Pour 2.5 cups of water into the pressure cooker. iv. Add half a teaspoon of turmeric powder and 1 pinch of asafoetida. v. Mix well and pressure cook the lentils for about 7-8 whistles over medium heat. vi. Open the pressure cooker once the pressure has been released. The lentils would have become soft and creamy. vii. (2) _____ the cooked lentils with a wired whisk or a spoon. If the consistency looks too thick, add about half to one cup of water and simmer the dal for 3 to 4 minutes. viii. Once the desired consistency is reached, add half a teaspoon of garam masala powder, two tablespoons of chopped coriander leaves and salt to taste. ix. (3) _____ off the heat. x. Mix well and (4) _____ the salt level before adding the tempering. xi. To smoke the lentils using the dhungar method, burn a small piece of charcoal on a grill till it becomes red hot. xii. Using tongs, (5) _____ the piece of charcoal in a small steel bowl or the hollowed-out half of an onion. xiii. Use only natural charcoal. Avoid anything that has a flame accelerant added. xiv. Pour about a quarter teaspoon of oil or ghee on the charcoal. xv. Fumes emanate from the hot charcoal as soon as oil or ghee is poured on it. xvi. Place the charcoal bowl on the dal. xvii. Cover the pressure cooker with its lid and let the smoke be infused into the dal for a minute or two. xviii. Smoking the dal for longer runs the risk of making the dal bitter. xix. Remove the bowl carefully with the help of tongs and cover the pressure cooker with its lid. xx. Heat 3 tablespoons of oil or ghee (clarified butter) in a small pan over low-medium heat. xxi. Crackle 1 teaspoon of cumin seeds in the oil/ghee. xxii. Add 2 to 3 dry red chilies, a generous pinch of asafoetida, and 5-6 finely chopped medium sized garlic cloves. xxiii. When the garlic has browned lightly and the red chilies have changed colour, add 1 teaspoon of crushed kasuri methi and half a teaspoon of red chilli powder. xxiv. Mix well and turn off the stove. xxv. Pour the tempering, along with the oil/ghee, into the dal. xxvi. Garnish with coriander leaves.",

Objective: To make dal tadka and use the dhungar method to incorporate a smoky flavour into the dish.  Method:  i. Thoroughly (1) _____ 1 cup of split and husked pigeon pea lentils (toor dal) in water. Add it to a pressure cooker. ii. Add half a cup of chopped onions, one cup of finely chopped tomatoes, 1 or 2 green chilies and 1 teaspoon of finely chopped ginger to the pressure cooker. iii. Pour 2.5 cups of water into the pressure cooker. iv. Add half a teaspoon of turmeric powder and 1 pinch of asafoetida. v. Mix well and pressure cook the lentils for about 7-8 whistles over medium heat. vi. Open the pressure cooker once the pressure has been released. The lentils would have become soft and creamy. vii. (2) _____ the cooked lentils with a wired whisk or a spoon. If the consistency looks too thick, add about half to one cup of water and simmer the dal for 3 to 4 minutes. viii. Once the desired consistency is reached, add half a teaspoon of garam masala powder, two tablespoons of chopped coriander leaves and salt to taste. ix. (3) _____ off the heat. x. Mix well and (4) _____ the salt level before adding the tempering. xi. To smoke the lentils using the dhungar method, burn a small piece of charcoal on a grill till it becomes red hot. xii. Using tongs, (5) _____ the piece of charcoal in a small steel bowl or the hollowed-out half of an onion. xiii. Use only natural charcoal. Avoid anything that has a flame accelerant added. xiv. Pour about a quarter teaspoon of oil or ghee on the charcoal. xv. Fumes emanate from the hot charcoal as soon as oil or ghee is poured on it. xvi. Place the charcoal bowl on the dal. xvii. Cover the pressure cooker with its lid and let the smoke be infused into the dal for a minute or two. xviii. Smoking the dal for longer runs the risk of making the dal bitter. xix. Remove the bowl carefully with the help of tongs and cover the pressure cooker with its lid. xx. Heat 3 tablespoons of oil or ghee (clarified butter) in a small pan over low-medium heat. xxi. Crackle 1 teaspoon of cumin seeds in the oil/ghee. xxii. Add 2 to 3 dry red chilies, a generous pinch of asafoetida, and 5-6 finely chopped medium sized garlic cloves. xxiii. When the garlic has browned lightly and the red chilies have changed colour, add 1 teaspoon of crushed kasuri methi and half a teaspoon of red chilli powder. xxiv. Mix well and turn off the stove. xxv. Pour the tempering, along with the oil/ghee, into the dal. xxvi. Garnish with coriander leaves.",

        "summary": "Here\u2019s a structured summary of the core topics, concepts, and principles essential for the **\"English II (Computer-Based Exam)\"** based on the provided question paper. Since this is an English language and comprehension exam, the focus is on **grammar, vocabulary, reading comprehension, writing skills, discourse markers, figures of speech, and communication etiquette**.\n\n---\n\n### **Core Topics & Concepts Summary**\n#### **1. Reading Comprehension**\n   - **Key Skills**:\n     - Identifying the **main idea**, **tone**, and **purpose** of a passage.\n     - Inferring meaning from context (e.g., understanding why the speaker in the passage about Bartleby complains about the \"lack of literature about an interesting man\").\n     - Recognizing **synonyms/antonyms** (e.g., \"ascertainable\" = \"determinable\"; \"tranquility\" \u2260 \"chaotic\").\n     - Analyzing **character traits** and **author\u2019s perspective** (e.g., the speaker describes himself as \"unambitious\" and values \"prudence\" and \"method\").\n   - **Passage Types**:\n     - Literary passages (e.g., excerpt from *Bartleby, the Scrivener* by Herman Melville).\n     - Dialogues (e.g., student-professor conversation about a TA position).\n     - Instructions (e.g., recipe for *dal tadka*).\n\n#### **2. Vocabulary**\n   - **Word Meanings**:\n     - **Avocation** = hobby (not \"job\" or \"altercation\").\n     - **Ere** = before.\n     - **Snug** = comfortable.\n     - **Indispensable** = essential.\n   - **Contextual Usage**:\n     - Words like \"orbicular\" (rounded), \"dhungar\" (smoking method in cooking), and \"tempering\" (adding spices to hot oil).\n   - **Figures of Speech**:\n     - **Simile**: Direct comparison using \"like\" or \"as\" (e.g., \"The water made a sound like kittens lapping\").\n     - **Metaphor**: Implied comparison (not explicitly tested here).\n     - **Paradox**: Seemingly contradictory statement (e.g., \"less is more\").\n\n#### **3. Grammar**\n   - **Tenses**:\n     - **Simple Past**: \"The cat rubbed up against my legs.\"\n     - **Present Perfect**: \"I have been following your research.\"\n     - **Conditional Sentences**:\n       - **Second Conditional**: \"It would have been fun if they were here.\" (hypothetical situation).\n   - **Voice**:\n     - **Active Voice**: \"The engineer constructed this house.\"\n     - **Passive Voice**: \"This house was constructed by the engineer.\"\n   - **Parts of Speech**:\n     - **Adverbs of Degree**: \"rather,\" \"badly\" (e.g., \"rather threadbare,\" \"smelled badly\").\n     - **Modals**: \"must\" (obligation), \"may\" (possibility), \"would\" (hypothetical).\n   - **Articles & Quantifiers**:\n     - Uncountable nouns: \"How much of the **rice** is good?\" (not \"apple\" or \"car\").\n     - Countable nouns: \"There are **too many cars** in the exhibition.\"\n   - **Question Tags**:\n     - \"Let\u2019s go for a hunt, **shall we**?\"\n   - **Reported Speech**:\n     - Direct to indirect: \"I said I **had been following his research** for a long time.\"\n\n#### **4. Writing Skills**\n   - **Formal vs. Informal Communication**:\n     - **Emails**:\n       - **Subject Line**: Clear and specific (e.g., \"Meeting Request for Course Discussion\").\n       - **Salutation**: Formal for professionals (e.g., \"Dear Professor Roberts\").\n       - **Closing**: Polite (e.g., \"Best regards\").\n       - **Tone**: Avoid informal language (e.g., \"Hey\" or \"Catch you later\").\n     - **Politeness in Requests**:\n       - Use \"could,\" \"please,\" and indirect questions (e.g., \"Could you deliver these items to my house, please?\").\n   - **Sentence Structure**:\n     - **Discourse Markers**:\n       - **Addition**: \"In addition,\" \"Moreover.\"\n       - **Contrast**: \"At the same time,\" \"However.\"\n       - **Opinion**: \"To my knowledge,\" \"Apparently.\"\n     - **Complement Clauses**: \"I do not know **whether he kept his account at the bank**...\"\n\n#### **5. Affixes (Prefixes & Suffixes)**\n   - **Prefixes**:\n     - \"Mis-\" in \"misnomers\" (negative connotation).\n     - \"In-\" in \"inability\" (negation).\n   - **Suffixes**:\n     - \"-ly\" in \"understandably\" (adverb).\n     - \"-ment\" in \"development\" (noun from verb).\n     - \"-en\" in \"darken\" (verb from adjective).\n   - **Counting Affixes**:\n     - Example: \"Local **residents** have become **angry** with the Forest Department\u2019s **inability** to capture the **elusive** tiger.\"\n       - Suffixes: **-ents**, **-y**, **-ility**, **-ive** (4 total, but answer is 3 because \"elusive\" is a root word with a suffix).\n\n#### **6. Practical Communication**\n   - **Social Etiquette**:\n     - Polite requests in supermarkets (e.g., \"Could you please help me reach that item?\").\n     - Professional emails (formal tone, clear subject lines).\n   - **Instructions**:\n     - Following step-by-step procedures (e.g., cooking *dal tadka*).\n     - Action verbs: \"rinse,\" \"mash,\" \"turn off,\" \"adjust,\" \"place.\"\n\n#### **7. Literary Devices**\n   - **Simile**: Explicit comparison (\"like kittens lapping\").\n   - **Irony/Paradox**: Not directly tested but useful for comprehension.\n   - **Alliteration**: Repetition of sounds (e.g., \"rounded and orbicular\").\n\n---\n\n### **Key Equations/Rules (Grammar Focus)**\n1. **Tenses**:\n   - Simple Past: **Subject + V2 (past form)**.\n     - Example: She **wrote** a letter.\n   - Present Perfect: **Subject + has/have + V3 (past participle)**.\n     - Example: I **have been following** his research.\n   - Second Conditional: **If + past simple, would + base verb**.\n     - Example: It **would be** fun if they **were** here.\n\n2. **Passive Voice**:\n   - **Object + be (tense) + V3 + by subject**.\n     - Example: The house **was constructed** by the engineer.\n\n3. **Question Tags**:\n   - **Auxiliary + subject (pronoun)**.\n     - Example: Let\u2019s go, **shall we**?\n\n4. **Reported Speech**:\n   - Present \u2192 Past shift:\n     - Direct: \"I **am** happy.\"\n     - Indirect: She said she **was** happy.\n\n5. **Articles**:\n   - **Uncountable nouns**: \"how much **rice**?\"\n   - **Countable nouns**: \"how many **cars**?\"\n\n6. **Modals**:\n   - **Must**: Obligation.\n     - Example: You **must** follow the guidelines.\n   - **May**: Permission/possibility.\n     - Example: It **may** rain tomorrow.\n\n7. **Adverbs of Degree**:\n   - Modify adjectives/adverbs:\n     - Example: \"rather **threadbare**,\" \"smelled **badly**.\"\n\n---\n\n### **Mermaid Knowledge Graphs**\n#### **1.
