I have known very many of them, professionally and privately, and if I pleased, could relate diverse histories, at which good-natured gentlemen might smile, and sentimental souls might weep. But I waive the biographies of all other scriveners for a few passages in the life of Bartleby, who was a scrivener of the strangest I ever saw or heard of. While of other law-copyists I might write the complete life, of Bartleby  nothing of that sort can be done. I believe that no materials exist for a full and satisfactory biography of this man. It is an irreparable loss to literature. Bartleby was one of those beings of whom nothing is ascertainable, except from the original sources, and in his case those are very small. What my own astonished eyes saw of Bartleby, that is all I know of him, except, indeed, one vague report which will appear in the sequel.  Ere introducing the scrivener, as he first appeared to me, it is fit I make some mention of myself, my employ\u00e9es, my business, my chambers, and general surroundings; because some such description is indispensable to an adequate understanding of the chief character about to be presented.  Imprimis: I am a man who, from his youth upwards, has been filled with a profound conviction that the easiest way of life is the best.

All who know me, consider me an eminently safe man. The late John Jacob Astor, a personage little given to poetic enthusiasm, had no hesitation in pronouncing my first grand point to be prudence; my next, method. I do not speak it in vanity, but simply record the fact, that I was not unemployed in my profession by the late John Jacob Astor; a name which, I admit, I love to repeat, for it hath a rounded and orbicular sound to it, and rings like unto bullion. I will freely add, that I was not insensible to the late John Jacob Astor\u2019s good opinion.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Source: Bartleby, the Scrivener - Herman Melville ",

I have known very many of them, professionally and privately, and if I pleased, could relate diverse histories, at which good-natured gentlemen might smile, and sentimental souls might weep. But I waive the biographies of all other scriveners for a few passages in the life of Bartleby, who was a scrivener of the strangest I ever saw or heard of. While of other law-copyists I might write the complete life, of Bartleby  nothing of that sort can be done. I believe that no materials exist for a full and satisfactory biography of this man. It is an irreparable loss to literature. Bartleby was one of those beings of whom nothing is ascertainable, except from the original sources, and in his case those are very small. What my own astonished eyes saw of Bartleby, that is all I know of him, except, indeed, one vague report which will appear in the sequel.  Ere introducing the scrivener, as he first appeared to me, it is fit I make some mention of myself, my employ\u00e9es, my business, my chambers, and general surroundings; because some such description is indispensable to an adequate understanding of the chief character about to be presented.  Imprimis: I am a man who, from his youth upwards, has been filled with a profound conviction that the easiest way of life is the best. Hence, though I belong to a profession proverbially energetic and nervous, even to turbulence, at times, yet nothing of that sort have I ever suffered to invade my peace.

All who know me, consider me an eminently safe man. The late John Jacob Astor, a personage little given to poetic enthusiasm, had no hesitation in pronouncing my first grand point to be prudence; my next, method. I do not speak it in vanity, but simply record the fact, that I was not unemployed in my profession by the late John Jacob Astor; a name which, I admit, I love to repeat, for it hath a rounded and orbicular sound to it, and rings like unto bullion. I will freely add, that I was not insensible to the late John Jacob Astor\u2019s good opinion.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Source: Bartleby, the Scrivener - Herman Melville ",

The nature of my avocations for the last thirty years has brought me into more than ordinary contact with what would seem an interesting and somewhat singular set of men, of whom as yet nothing that I know of has ever been written:\u2014I mean the law-copyists or scriveners. I have known very many of them, professionally and privately, and if I pleased, could relate diverse histories, at which good-natured gentlemen might smile, and sentimental souls might weep. But I waive the biographies of all other scriveners for a few passages in the life of Bartleby, who was a scrivener of the strangest I ever saw or heard of. While of other law-copyists I might write the complete life, of Bartleby  nothing of that sort can be done. I believe that no materials exist for a full and satisfactory biography of this man. It is an irreparable loss to literature. Bartleby was one of those beings of whom nothing is ascertainable, except from the original sources, and in his case those are very small. What my own astonished eyes saw of Bartleby, that is all I know of him, except, indeed, one vague report which will appear in the sequel.  Ere introducing the scrivener, as he first appeared to me, it is fit I make some mention of myself, my employ\u00e9es, my business, my chambers, and general surroundings; because some such description is indispensable to an adequate understanding of the chief character about to be presented.  Imprimis: I am a man who, from his youth upwards, has been filled with a profound conviction that the easiest way of life is the best. Hence, though I belong to a profession proverbially energetic and nervous, even to turbulence, at times, yet nothing of that sort have I ever suffered to invade my peace. I am one of those unambitious lawyers who never addresses a jury, or in any way draws down public applause; but in the cool tranquility of a snug retreat, do a snug business among rich men\u2019s bonds and mortgages and title-deeds. All who know me, consider me an eminently safe man. The late John Jacob Astor, a personage little given to poetic enthusiasm, had no hesitation in pronouncing my first grand point to be prudence; my next, method. I do not speak it in vanity, but simply record the fact, that I was not unemployed in my profession by the late John Jacob Astor; a name which, I admit, I love to repeat, for it hath a rounded and orbicular sound to it, and rings like unto bullion.

I have known very many of them, professionally and privately, and if I pleased, could relate diverse histories, at which good-natured gentlemen might smile, and sentimental souls might weep. But I waive the biographies of all other scriveners for a few passages in the life of Bartleby, who was a scrivener of the strangest I ever saw or heard of. While of other law-copyists I might write the complete life, of Bartleby  nothing of that sort can be done. I believe that no materials exist for a full and satisfactory biography of this man. It is an irreparable loss to literature. Bartleby was one of those beings of whom nothing is ascertainable, except from the original sources, and in his case those are very small. What my own astonished eyes saw of Bartleby, that is all I know of him, except, indeed, one vague report which will appear in the sequel.  Ere introducing the scrivener, as he first appeared to me, it is fit I make some mention of myself, my employ\u00e9es, my business, my chambers, and general surroundings; because some such description is indispensable to an adequate understanding of the chief character about to be presented.  Imprimis: I am a man who, from his youth upwards, has been filled with a profound conviction that the easiest way of life is the best. Hence, though I belong to a profession proverbially energetic and nervous, even to turbulence, at times, yet nothing of that sort have I ever suffered to invade my peace. I am one of those unambitious lawyers who never addresses a jury, or in any way draws down public applause; but in the cool tranquility of a snug retreat, do a snug business among rich men\u2019s bonds and mortgages and title-deeds. All who know me, consider me an eminently safe man. The late John Jacob Astor, a personage little given to poetic enthusiasm, had no hesitation in pronouncing my first grand point to be prudence; my next, method. I do not speak it in vanity, but simply record the fact, that I was not unemployed in my profession by the late John Jacob Astor; a name which, I admit, I love to repeat, for it hath a rounded and orbicular sound to it, and rings like unto bullion. I will freely add, that I was not insensible to the late John Jacob Astor\u2019s good opinion.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Source: Bartleby, the Scrivener - Herman Melville ",

The nature of my avocations for the last thirty years has brought me into more than ordinary contact with what would seem an interesting and somewhat singular set of men, of whom as yet nothing that I know of has ever been written:\u2014I mean the law-copyists or scriveners. I have known very many of them, professionally and privately, and if I pleased, could relate diverse histories, at which good-natured gentlemen might smile, and sentimental souls might weep. But I waive the biographies of all other scriveners for a few passages in the life of Bartleby, who was a scrivener of the strangest I ever saw or heard of. While of other law-copyists I might write the complete life, of Bartleby  nothing of that sort can be done. I believe that no materials exist for a full and satisfactory biography of this man. It is an irreparable loss to literature. Bartleby was one of those beings of whom nothing is ascertainable, except from the original sources, and in his case those are very small. What my own astonished eyes saw of Bartleby, that is all I know of him, except, indeed, one vague report which will appear in the sequel.  Ere introducing the scrivener, as he first appeared to me, it is fit I make some mention of myself, my employ\u00e9es, my business, my chambers, and general surroundings; because some such description is indispensable to an adequate understanding of the chief character about to be presented.  Imprimis: I am a man who, from his youth upwards, has been filled with a profound conviction that the easiest way of life is the best. Hence, though I belong to a profession proverbially energetic and nervous, even to turbulence, at times, yet nothing of that sort have I ever suffered to invade my peace. I am one of those unambitious lawyers who never addresses a jury, or in any way draws down public applause; but in the cool tranquility of a snug retreat, do a snug business among rich men\u2019s bonds and mortgages and title-deeds. All who know me, consider me an eminently safe man. The late John Jacob Astor, a personage little given to poetic enthusiasm, had no hesitation in pronouncing my first grand point to be prudence; my next, method. I do not speak it in vanity, but simply record the fact, that I was not unemployed in my profession by the late John Jacob Astor; a name which, I admit, I love to repeat, for it hath a rounded and orbicular sound to it, and rings like unto bullion. I will freely add, that I was not insensible to the late John Jacob Astor\u2019s good opinion.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Source: Bartleby, the Scrivener - Herman Melville "

I have known very many of them, professionally and privately, and if I pleased, could relate diverse histories, at which good-natured gentlemen might smile, and sentimental souls might weep. But I waive the biographies of all other scriveners for a few passages in the life of Bartleby, who was a scrivener of the strangest I ever saw or heard of. While of other law-copyists I might write the complete life, of Bartleby  nothing of that sort can be done. I believe that no materials exist for a full and satisfactory biography of this man. It is an irreparable loss to literature. Bartleby was one of those beings of whom nothing is ascertainable, except from the original sources, and in his case those are very small. What my own astonished eyes saw of Bartleby, that is all I know of him, except, indeed, one vague report which will appear in the sequel.  Ere introducing the scrivener, as he first appeared to me, it is fit I make some mention of myself, my employ\u00e9es, my business, my chambers, and general surroundings; because some such description is indispensable to an adequate understanding of the chief character about to be presented.  Imprimis: I am a man who, from his youth upwards, has been filled with a profound conviction that the easiest way of life is the best. Hence, though I belong to a profession proverbially energetic and nervous, even to turbulence, at times, yet nothing of that sort have I ever suffered to invade my peace.

All who know me, consider me an eminently safe man. The late John Jacob Astor, a personage little given to poetic enthusiasm, had no hesitation in pronouncing my first grand point to be prudence; my next, method. I do not speak it in vanity, but simply record the fact, that I was not unemployed in my profession by the late John Jacob Astor; a name which, I admit, I love to repeat, for it hath a rounded and orbicular sound to it, and rings like unto bullion. I will freely add, that I was not insensible to the late John Jacob Astor\u2019s good opinion.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Source: Bartleby, the Scrivener - Herman Melville ",

Abeer: Well, I am interested in the internship at the university art museum\u2026 what responsibilities interns have, what qualifications they need to have... Prof. Sriram: Sorry, those positions are all filled for this year...  Abeer: Oh! But I just saw the announcement on the museum website this morning. Prof. Sriram: Unfortunately, the website is out of date.  Abeer: I want to do museum work after I graduate, and the job experience would look great on my r\u00e9sum\u00e9. Plus it's the only paid internship on campus. Prof. Sriram: I understand. However, there are some other ways to get some work experience, even if it's not exactly what you want. For instance, the library is looking for student volunteers.  Abeer: The library? But... Prof. Sriram: Well, they're planning an exhibition of photographs documenting the history of the university. And they're looking for student volunteers to help go through the archives and select images that'll show how the university's changed over the last hundred years.  Abeer: Hmm... Prof. Sriram: Now that's only a four-week project, I think. And, of course, it's unpaid.  Abeer: But it would be something to put on my r\u00e9sum\u00e9... Prof. Sriram: Exactly. Why don't you read the job description\u2014it's posted on the library's website. If you're interested, let me know, and I'll put in a good word for you with Geeta Raj.

Prof. Sriram: Hi, Abeer. How can I help you?  Abeer: I was told that you place students in internships for various university programs. Prof. Sriram: Yes.  Abeer: Well, I am interested in the internship at the university art museum\u2026 what responsibilities interns have, what qualifications they need to have... Prof. Sriram: Sorry, those positions are all filled for this year...  Abeer: Oh! But I just saw the announcement on the museum website this morning. Prof. Sriram: Unfortunately, the website is out of date.  Abeer: I want to do museum work after I graduate, and the job experience would look great on my r\u00e9sum\u00e9. Plus it's the only paid internship on campus. Prof. Sriram: I understand. However, there are some other ways to get some work experience, even if it's not exactly what you want. For instance, the library is looking for student volunteers.  Abeer: The library? But... Prof. Sriram: Well, they're planning an exhibition of photographs documenting the history of the university. And they're looking for student volunteers to help go through the archives and select images that'll show how the university's changed over the last hundred years.  Abeer: Hmm... Prof. Sriram: Now that's only a four-week project, I think. And, of course, it's unpaid.  Abeer: But it would be something to put on my r\u00e9sum\u00e9... Prof. Sriram: Exactly. Why don't you read the job description\u2014it's posted on the library's website. If you're interested, let me know, and I'll put in a good word for you with Geeta Raj. She's the library's exhibitions director and will be interviewing applicants.  Abeer: OK, I'll do that right away. ",

Abeer: Well, I am interested in the internship at the university art museum\u2026 what responsibilities interns have, what qualifications they need to have... Prof. Sriram: Sorry, those positions are all filled for this year...  Abeer: Oh! But I just saw the announcement on the museum website this morning. Prof. Sriram: Unfortunately, the website is out of date.  Abeer: I want to do museum work after I graduate, and the job experience would look great on my r\u00e9sum\u00e9. Plus it's the only paid internship on campus. Prof. Sriram: I understand. However, there are some other ways to get some work experience, even if it's not exactly what you want. For instance, the library is looking for student volunteers.  Abeer: The library? But... Prof. Sriram: Well, they're planning an exhibition of photographs documenting the history of the university. And they're looking for student volunteers to help go through the archives and select images that'll show how the university's changed over the last hundred years.  Abeer: Hmm... Prof. Sriram: Now that's only a four-week project, I think. And, of course, it's unpaid.  Abeer: But it would be something to put on my r\u00e9sum\u00e9... Prof. Sriram: Exactly. Why don't you read the job description\u2014it's posted on the library's website. If you're interested, let me know, and I'll put in a good word for you with Geeta Raj.

        "summary": "Here\u2019s a structured **summary of core topics, concepts, and principles** for the **\"English 2\" (Semester 2, Foundation Level)** exam, based on the provided question paper.\nThe exam tests **comprehension, grammar, vocabulary, syntax, semantics, and communication skills** in English.\nNo equations are involved (as this is a language-focused subject), but rules, definitions, and linguistic structures are critical.\n\n---\n\n## **Core Topics & Concepts**\n### **1. Reading Comprehension**\n   - **Key Skills**:\n     - Identifying the **main idea**, **tone**, and **purpose** of a passage.\n     - Inferring **implicit meanings** (e.g., why the speaker avoids writing about other scriveners in *Bartleby, the Scrivener*).\n     - Recognizing **literary devices** (e.g., irony, metaphor, understatement).\n     - Answering **fact-based** and **inference-based** questions.\n   - **Example Passage**: *Bartleby, the Scrivener* by Herman Melville (focus on **character analysis**, **narrator\u2019s perspective**, and **themes of isolation**).\n   - **Vocabulary in Context**:\n     - Synonyms/antonyms (e.g., *avocation* = hobby, *tranquility* \u2260 chaotic).\n     - Word stress and syllables (e.g., *destiny* \u2192 **DES-ti-ny** [stress on 1st syllable]).\n\n---\n\n### **2. Grammar & Syntax**\n#### **A. Sentence Structure**\n   - **Simple/Compound/Complex Sentences**:\n     - *Rohan resigned and joined a new company.* \u2192 **Compound sentence** (two independent clauses).\n   - **Clauses**:\n     - **Relative/Adjectival Clauses** (modify nouns):\n       - *Reena, **who developed the algorithm**, was honored.* \u2192 *\"who developed the algorithm\"* is the adjectival clause.\n     - **Complement Clauses** (complete the meaning of a verb):\n       - *He is sure **that Hari will walk in soon**.* \u2192 *\"that Hari will walk in soon\"* is a complement clause.\n     - **Adverbial Clauses** (modify verbs/adjectives/adverbs):\n       - *Anuradha is leaving **after she has had her dinner**.* \u2192 *\"after she has had her dinner\"* is an adverbial clause (adjunct).\n\n#### **B.
