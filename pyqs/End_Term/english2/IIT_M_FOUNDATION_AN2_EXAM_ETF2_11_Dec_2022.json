In consequence I'm inclined to reserve all judgments, a habit that has opened up many curious natures to me and also made me the victim of not a few veteran bores. The abnormal mind is quick to detect and attach itself to this quality when it appears in a normal person, and so it came about that in college I was unjustly accused of being a politician, because I was privy to the secret griefs of wild, unknown men.

I volunteer to tutor some primary school students in maths on Mondays. Professor: Ahhh\u2026 I see. Student: Yeah. Is that OK? If I only come on Thursdays? Professor: Is it possible to change your tutoring day? Student: Not really. The tutoring counts toward the community service requirement for graduation.

This year, we will also try to attend the annual maths education conference that is going to be held in our city. Student: That sounds very exciting! I would love to be at the conference. Professor: So\u2026 you probably know that we meet every Monday and Thursday. Student: Yeah\u2026 There's one thing. I volunteer to tutor some primary school students in maths on Mondays. Professor: Ahhh\u2026 I see. Student: Yeah. Is that OK? If I only come on Thursdays? Professor: Is it possible to change your tutoring day? Student: Not really. The tutoring counts toward the community service requirement for graduation. And the way the school set up the program, Mondays are for maths, so I have to be there. Professor: Well, it should be OK.
