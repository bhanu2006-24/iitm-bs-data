In 1923, the year after James Joyce\u2019s novel Ulysses was first published in its complete form, T. S. Eliot wrote: \u201cI hold this book to be the most important expression which the present age has found; it is a book to which we are all indebted, and from which none of us can escape.\u201d Although Ulysses was not yet widely available at the time\u2014its initial print runs were minuscule and it would be banned repeatedly by censorship boards\u2014Eliot was writing in defense of a novel already broadly disparaged as immoral, obscene, formless, and chaotic. His friend Virginia Woolf had described it in her diary as \u201can illiterate, underbred book \u2026 the book of a self-taught working man, & we all know how distressing they are.\u201d In comparison, Eliot\u2019s praise is triumphal. \u201cA book to which we are all indebted, and from which none of us can escape.\u201d And yet this proposed relationship between Ulysses and its readers may not seem altogether inviting either. Do we really want to read a novel in order to experience the sensation of inescapable debt? In the century since its publication, Ulysses has of course become a monument not only of modernist literature but of the novel itself. But it\u2019s also a notoriously \u201cdifficult\u201d book. Among all English-language novels, there may be no greater gulf between how much a work is celebrated and discussed, and how seldom it is actually read.  I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a ___________ that very soon after the publication of Ulysses, critics started to speculate that the novel as a form might be dying. In 1925, the Spanish philosopher Jose Ortega y Gasset wrote of the \u201cdecline of the novel,\u201d comparing the genre to a \u201cvast but finite quarry.\u201d \u201cWhen the quarry is worked out,\u201d he warned, \u201ctalent, however great, can achieve nothing.\u201d A few years later, in 1930, Walter Benjamin wrote of the \u201ccrisis of the novel.\u201d These two very different works, Ortega\u2019s book and Benjamin\u2019s short essay, both make reference, albeit in passing, to James Joyce. In fact, in T. S. Eliot\u2019s piece in praise of Ulysses, he remarks, \u201cIf it is not a novel, that is simply because the novel is a form which will no longer serve,\u201d and later adds that \u201cthe novel ended with Flaubert and with James.\u201d In the present day, the \u201cdeath of the novel\u201d is declared so regularly and with so little provocation that this might not seem to be of any great significance: but I don\u2019t know that the novel was ever declared dead even once before Ulysses was published.  Joyce was, as we know, writing at a time of enormous artistic and cultural upheaval. The seemingly stable conventions of classical music were being shattered by composers like Arnold Sch\u00f6nberg; the refined traditions of Western realist painting were revolutionized by the Cubism of Picasso and Braque. And writers like Marcel Proust were already beginning to destabilize the familiarities of the nineteenth-century novel form. It\u2019s easy to understand in this context how a book as innovative and iconoclastic as Ulysses could be seen as striking the final blow against an already ailing literary tradition. In fact, it might be less easy to understand why, one hundred years later, the novel is still lumbering on, not yet superseded by any more popular or critically significant form of textual storytelling. Classical music, after all, effectively gave way to popular music in the twentieth century; figurative painting never again reasserted itself as a dominant cultural form. But novels as we know them are still being written and widely read. And as one of the people writing and reading them, I can\u2019t help but be interested in the question. What exactly did Ulysses do to the novel? And if we can\u2019t escape it, how can we go on?",

In 1923, the year after James Joyce\u2019s novel Ulysses was first published in its complete form, T. S.

His friend Virginia Woolf had described it in her diary as \u201can illiterate, underbred book \u2026 the book of a self-taught working man, & we all know how distressing they are.\u201d In comparison, Eliot\u2019s praise is triumphal. \u201cA book to which we are all indebted, and from which none of us can escape.\u201d And yet this proposed relationship between Ulysses and its readers may not seem altogether inviting either. Do we really want to read a novel in order to experience the sensation of inescapable debt? In the century since its publication, Ulysses has of course become a monument not only of modernist literature but of the novel itself. But it\u2019s also a notoriously \u201cdifficult\u201d book. Among all English-language novels, there may be no greater gulf between how much a work is celebrated and discussed, and how seldom it is actually read.  I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a ___________ that very soon after the publication of Ulysses, critics started to speculate that the novel as a form might be dying. In 1925, the Spanish philosopher Jose Ortega y Gasset wrote of the \u201cdecline of the novel,\u201d comparing the genre to a \u201cvast but finite quarry.\u201d \u201cWhen the quarry is worked out,\u201d he warned, \u201ctalent, however great, can achieve nothing.\u201d A few years later, in 1930, Walter Benjamin wrote of the \u201ccrisis of the novel.\u201d These two very different works, Ortega\u2019s book and Benjamin\u2019s short essay, both make reference, albeit in passing, to James Joyce. In fact, in T. S. Eliot\u2019s piece in praise of Ulysses, he remarks, \u201cIf it is not a novel, that is simply because the novel is a form which will no longer serve,\u201d and later adds that \u201cthe novel ended with Flaubert and with James.\u201d In the present day, the \u201cdeath of the novel\u201d is declared so regularly and with so little provocation that this might not seem to be of any great significance: but I don\u2019t know that the novel was ever declared dead even once before Ulysses was published.  Joyce was, as we know, writing at a time of enormous artistic and cultural upheaval. The seemingly stable conventions of classical music were being shattered by composers like Arnold Sch\u00f6nberg; the refined traditions of Western realist painting were revolutionized by the Cubism of Picasso and Braque. And writers like Marcel Proust were already beginning to destabilize the familiarities of the nineteenth-century novel form. It\u2019s easy to understand in this context how a book as innovative and iconoclastic as Ulysses could be seen as striking the final blow against an already ailing literary tradition. In fact, it might be less easy to understand why, one hundred years later, the novel is still lumbering on, not yet superseded by any more popular or critically significant form of textual storytelling. Classical music, after all, effectively gave way to popular music in the twentieth century; figurative painting never again reasserted itself as a dominant cultural form. But novels as we know them are still being written and widely read. And as one of the people writing and reading them, I can\u2019t help but be interested in the question.

In 1923, the year after James Joyce\u2019s novel Ulysses was first published in its complete form, T. S. Eliot wrote: \u201cI hold this book to be the most important expression which the present age has found; it is a book to which we are all indebted, and from which none of us can escape.\u201d Although Ulysses was not yet widely available at the time\u2014its initial print runs were minuscule and it would be banned repeatedly by censorship boards\u2014Eliot was writing in defense of a novel already broadly disparaged as immoral, obscene, formless, and chaotic. His friend Virginia Woolf had described it in her diary as \u201can illiterate, underbred book \u2026 the book of a self-taught working man, & we all know how distressing they are.\u201d In comparison, Eliot\u2019s praise is triumphal. \u201cA book to which we are all indebted, and from which none of us can escape.\u201d And yet this proposed relationship between Ulysses and its readers may not seem altogether inviting either. Do we really want to read a novel in order to experience the sensation of inescapable debt? In the century since its publication, Ulysses has of course become a monument not only of modernist literature but of the novel itself. But it\u2019s also a notoriously \u201cdifficult\u201d book. Among all English-language novels, there may be no greater gulf between how much a work is celebrated and discussed, and how seldom it is actually read.  I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a ___________ that very soon after the publication of Ulysses, critics started to speculate that the novel as a form might be dying. In 1925, the Spanish philosopher Jose Ortega y Gasset wrote of the \u201cdecline of the novel,\u201d comparing the genre to a \u201cvast but finite quarry.\u201d \u201cWhen the quarry is worked out,\u201d he warned, \u201ctalent, however great, can achieve nothing.\u201d A few years later, in 1930, Walter Benjamin wrote of the \u201ccrisis of the novel.\u201d These two very different works, Ortega\u2019s book and Benjamin\u2019s short essay, both make reference, albeit in passing, to James Joyce. In fact, in T. S. Eliot\u2019s piece in praise of Ulysses, he remarks, \u201cIf it is not a novel, that is simply because the novel is a form which will no longer serve,\u201d and later adds that \u201cthe novel ended with Flaubert and with James.\u201d In the present day, the \u201cdeath of the novel\u201d is declared so regularly and with so little provocation that this might not seem to be of any great significance: but I don\u2019t know that the novel was ever declared dead even once before Ulysses was published.  Joyce was, as we know, writing at a time of enormous artistic and cultural upheaval. The seemingly stable conventions of classical music were being shattered by composers like Arnold Sch\u00f6nberg; the refined traditions of Western realist painting were revolutionized by the Cubism of Picasso and Braque. And writers like Marcel Proust were already beginning to destabilize the familiarities of the nineteenth-century novel form. It\u2019s easy to understand in this context how a book as innovative and iconoclastic as Ulysses could be seen as striking the final blow against an already ailing literary tradition. In fact, it might be less easy to understand why, one hundred years later, the novel is still lumbering on, not yet superseded by any more popular or critically significant form of textual storytelling. Classical music, after all, effectively gave way to popular music in the twentieth century; figurative painting never again reasserted itself as a dominant cultural form. But novels as we know them are still being written and widely read. And as one of the people writing and reading them, I can\u2019t help but be interested in the question. What exactly did Ulysses do to the novel? And if we can\u2019t escape it, how can we go on?",

In 1923, the year after James Joyce\u2019s novel Ulysses was first published in its complete form, T. S. Eliot wrote: \u201cI hold this book to be the most important expression which the present age has found; it is a book to which we are all indebted, and from which none of us can escape.\u201d Although Ulysses was not yet widely available at the time\u2014its initial print runs were minuscule and it would be banned repeatedly by censorship boards\u2014Eliot was writing in defense of a novel already broadly disparaged as immoral, obscene, formless, and chaotic. His friend Virginia Woolf had described it in her diary as \u201can illiterate, underbred book \u2026 the book of a self-taught working man, & we all know how distressing they are.\u201d In comparison, Eliot\u2019s praise is triumphal. \u201cA book to which we are all indebted, and from which none of us can escape.\u201d And yet this proposed relationship between Ulysses and its readers may not seem altogether inviting either. Do we really want to read a novel in order to experience the sensation of inescapable debt? In the century since its publication, Ulysses has of course become a monument not only of modernist literature but of the novel itself. But it\u2019s also a notoriously \u201cdifficult\u201d book. Among all English-language novels, there may be no greater gulf between how much a work is celebrated and discussed, and how seldom it is actually read.  I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a ___________ that very soon after the publication of Ulysses, critics started to speculate that the novel as a form might be dying. In 1925, the Spanish philosopher Jose Ortega y Gasset wrote of the \u201cdecline of the novel,\u201d comparing the genre to a \u201cvast but finite quarry.\u201d \u201cWhen the quarry is worked out,\u201d he warned, \u201ctalent, however great, can achieve nothing.\u201d A few years later, in 1930, Walter Benjamin wrote of the \u201ccrisis of the novel.\u201d These two very different works, Ortega\u2019s book and Benjamin\u2019s short essay, both make reference, albeit in passing, to James Joyce. In fact, in T. S. Eliot\u2019s piece in praise of Ulysses, he remarks, \u201cIf it is not a novel, that is simply because the novel is a form which will no longer serve,\u201d and later adds that \u201cthe novel ended with Flaubert and with James.\u201d In the present day, the \u201cdeath of the novel\u201d is declared so regularly and with so little provocation that this might not seem to be of any great significance: but I don\u2019t know that the novel was ever declared dead even once before Ulysses was published.  Joyce was, as we know, writing at a time of enormous artistic and cultural upheaval. The seemingly stable conventions of classical music were being shattered by composers like Arnold Sch\u00f6nberg; the refined traditions of Western realist painting were revolutionized by the Cubism of Picasso and Braque. And writers like Marcel Proust were already beginning to destabilize the familiarities of the nineteenth-century novel form. It\u2019s easy to understand in this context how a book as innovative and iconoclastic as Ulysses could be seen as striking the final blow against an already ailing literary tradition. In fact, it might be less easy to understand why, one hundred years later, the novel is still lumbering on, not yet superseded by any more popular or critically significant form of textual storytelling. Classical music, after all, effectively gave way to popular music in the twentieth century; figurative painting never again reasserted itself as a dominant cultural form. But novels as we know them are still being written and widely read. And as one of the people writing and reading them, I can\u2019t help but be interested in the question.

                            "Read the following passage and answer the given subquestions.  In 1923, the year after James Joyce\u2019s novel Ulysses was first published in its complete form, T. S. Eliot wrote: \u201cI hold this book to be the most important expression which the present age has found; it is a book to which we are all indebted, and from which none of us can escape.\u201d Although Ulysses was not yet widely available at the time\u2014its initial print runs were minuscule and it would be banned repeatedly by censorship boards\u2014Eliot was writing in defense of a novel already broadly disparaged as immoral, obscene, formless, and chaotic. His friend Virginia Woolf had described it in her diary as \u201can illiterate, underbred book \u2026 the book of a self-taught working man, & we all know how distressing they are.\u201d In comparison, Eliot\u2019s praise is triumphal. \u201cA book to which we are all indebted, and from which none of us can escape.\u201d And yet this proposed relationship between Ulysses and its readers may not seem altogether inviting either. Do we really want to read a novel in order to experience the sensation of inescapable debt? In the century since its publication, Ulysses has of course become a monument not only of modernist literature but of the novel itself. But it\u2019s also a notoriously \u201cdifficult\u201d book. Among all English-language novels, there may be no greater gulf between how much a work is celebrated and discussed, and how seldom it is actually read.  I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a ___________ that very soon after the publication of Ulysses, critics started to speculate that the novel as a form might be dying. In 1925, the Spanish philosopher Jose Ortega y Gasset wrote of the \u201cdecline of the novel,\u201d comparing the genre to a \u201cvast but finite quarry.\u201d \u201cWhen the quarry is worked out,\u201d he warned, \u201ctalent, however great, can achieve nothing.\u201d A few years later, in 1930, Walter Benjamin wrote of the \u201ccrisis of the novel.\u201d These two very different works, Ortega\u2019s book and Benjamin\u2019s short essay, both make reference, albeit in passing, to James Joyce. In fact, in T. S. Eliot\u2019s piece in praise of Ulysses, he remarks, \u201cIf it is not a novel, that is simply because the novel is a form which will no longer serve,\u201d and later adds that \u201cthe novel ended with Flaubert and with James.\u201d In the present day, the \u201cdeath of the novel\u201d is declared so regularly and with so little provocation that this might not seem to be of any great significance: but I don\u2019t know that the novel was ever declared dead even once before Ulysses was published.  Joyce was, as we know, writing at a time of enormous artistic and cultural upheaval. The seemingly stable conventions of classical music were being shattered by composers like Arnold Sch\u00f6nberg; the refined traditions of Western realist painting were revolutionized by the Cubism of Picasso and Braque. And writers like Marcel Proust were already beginning to destabilize the familiarities of the nineteenth-century novel form. It\u2019s easy to understand in this context how a book as innovative and iconoclastic as Ulysses could be seen as striking the final blow against an already ailing literary tradition. In fact, it might be less easy to understand why, one hundred years later, the novel is still lumbering on, not yet superseded by any more popular or critically significant form of textual storytelling. Classical music, after all, effectively gave way to popular music in the twentieth century; figurative painting never again reasserted itself as a dominant cultural form. But novels as we know them are still being written and widely read. And as one of the people writing and reading them, I can\u2019t help but be interested in the question. What exactly did Ulysses do to the novel? And if we can\u2019t escape it, how can we go on?"

Eliot\u2019s piece in praise of Ulysses, he remarks, \u201cIf it is not a novel, that is simply because the novel is a form which will no longer serve,\u201d and later adds that \u201cthe novel ended with Flaubert and with James.\u201d In the present day, the \u201cdeath of the novel\u201d is declared so regularly and with so little provocation that this might not seem to be of any great significance: but I don\u2019t know that the novel was ever declared dead even once before Ulysses was published.  Joyce was, as we know, writing at a time of enormous artistic and cultural upheaval. The seemingly stable conventions of classical music were being shattered by composers like Arnold Sch\u00f6nberg; the refined traditions of Western realist painting were revolutionized by the Cubism of Picasso and Braque. And writers like Marcel Proust were already beginning to destabilize the familiarities of the nineteenth-century novel form. It\u2019s easy to understand in this context how a book as innovative and iconoclastic as Ulysses could be seen as striking the final blow against an already ailing literary tradition. In fact, it might be less easy to understand why, one hundred years later, the novel is still lumbering on, not yet superseded by any more popular or critically significant form of textual storytelling. Classical music, after all, effectively gave way to popular music in the twentieth century; figurative painting never again reasserted itself as a dominant cultural form. But novels as we know them are still being written and widely read. And as one of the people writing and reading them, I can\u2019t help but be interested in the question. What exactly did Ulysses do to the novel? And if we can\u2019t escape it, how can we go on?"

In 1923, the year after James Joyce\u2019s novel Ulysses was first published in its complete form, T. S.

His friend Virginia Woolf had described it in her diary as \u201can illiterate, underbred book \u2026 the book of a self-taught working man, & we all know how distressing they are.\u201d In comparison, Eliot\u2019s praise is triumphal. \u201cA book to which we are all indebted, and from which none of us can escape.\u201d And yet this proposed relationship between Ulysses and its readers may not seem altogether inviting either. Do we really want to read a novel in order to experience the sensation of inescapable debt? In the century since its publication, Ulysses has of course become a monument not only of modernist literature but of the novel itself. But it\u2019s also a notoriously \u201cdifficult\u201d book. Among all English-language novels, there may be no greater gulf between how much a work is celebrated and discussed, and how seldom it is actually read.  I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a ___________ that very soon after the publication of Ulysses, critics started to speculate that the novel as a form might be dying. In 1925, the Spanish philosopher Jose Ortega y Gasset wrote of the \u201cdecline of the novel,\u201d comparing the genre to a \u201cvast but finite quarry.\u201d \u201cWhen the quarry is worked out,\u201d he warned, \u201ctalent, however great, can achieve nothing.\u201d A few years later, in 1930, Walter Benjamin wrote of the \u201ccrisis of the novel.\u201d These two very different works, Ortega\u2019s book and Benjamin\u2019s short essay, both make reference, albeit in passing, to James Joyce. In fact, in T. S. Eliot\u2019s piece in praise of Ulysses, he remarks, \u201cIf it is not a novel, that is simply because the novel is a form which will no longer serve,\u201d and later adds that \u201cthe novel ended with Flaubert and with James.\u201d In the present day, the \u201cdeath of the novel\u201d is declared so regularly and with so little provocation that this might not seem to be of any great significance: but I don\u2019t know that the novel was ever declared dead even once before Ulysses was published.  Joyce was, as we know, writing at a time of enormous artistic and cultural upheaval. The seemingly stable conventions of classical music were being shattered by composers like Arnold Sch\u00f6nberg; the refined traditions of Western realist painting were revolutionized by the Cubism of Picasso and Braque. And writers like Marcel Proust were already beginning to destabilize the familiarities of the nineteenth-century novel form. It\u2019s easy to understand in this context how a book as innovative and iconoclastic as Ulysses could be seen as striking the final blow against an already ailing literary tradition. In fact, it might be less easy to understand why, one hundred years later, the novel is still lumbering on, not yet superseded by any more popular or critically significant form of textual storytelling. Classical music, after all, effectively gave way to popular music in the twentieth century; figurative painting never again reasserted itself as a dominant cultural form. But novels as we know them are still being written and widely read. And as one of the people writing and reading them, I can\u2019t help but be interested in the question.

In 1923, the year after James Joyce\u2019s novel Ulysses was first published in its complete form, T. S. Eliot wrote: \u201cI hold this book to be the most important expression which the present age has found; it is a book to which we are all indebted, and from which none of us can escape.\u201d Although Ulysses was not yet widely available at the time\u2014its initial print runs were minuscule and it would be banned repeatedly by censorship boards\u2014Eliot was writing in defense of a novel already broadly disparaged as immoral, obscene, formless, and chaotic. His friend Virginia Woolf had described it in her diary as \u201can illiterate, underbred book \u2026 the book of a self-taught working man, & we all know how distressing they are.\u201d In comparison, Eliot\u2019s praise is triumphal. \u201cA book to which we are all indebted, and from which none of us can escape.\u201d And yet this proposed relationship between Ulysses and its readers may not seem altogether inviting either. Do we really want to read a novel in order to experience the sensation of inescapable debt? In the century since its publication, Ulysses has of course become a monument not only of modernist literature but of the novel itself. But it\u2019s also a notoriously \u201cdifficult\u201d book. Among all English-language novels, there may be no greater gulf between how much a work is celebrated and discussed, and how seldom it is actually read.  I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a ___________ that very soon after the publication of Ulysses, critics started to speculate that the novel as a form might be dying. In 1925, the Spanish philosopher Jose Ortega y Gasset wrote of the \u201cdecline of the novel,\u201d comparing the genre to a \u201cvast but finite quarry.\u201d \u201cWhen the quarry is worked out,\u201d he warned, \u201ctalent, however great, can achieve nothing.\u201d A few years later, in 1930, Walter Benjamin wrote of the \u201ccrisis of the novel.\u201d These two very different works, Ortega\u2019s book and Benjamin\u2019s short essay, both make reference, albeit in passing, to James Joyce. In fact, in T. S. Eliot\u2019s piece in praise of Ulysses, he remarks, \u201cIf it is not a novel, that is simply because the novel is a form which will no longer serve,\u201d and later adds that \u201cthe novel ended with Flaubert and with James.\u201d In the present day, the \u201cdeath of the novel\u201d is declared so regularly and with so little provocation that this might not seem to be of any great significance: but I don\u2019t know that the novel was ever declared dead even once before Ulysses was published.  Joyce was, as we know, writing at a time of enormous artistic and cultural upheaval. The seemingly stable conventions of classical music were being shattered by composers like Arnold Sch\u00f6nberg; the refined traditions of Western realist painting were revolutionized by the Cubism of Picasso and Braque. And writers like Marcel Proust were already beginning to destabilize the familiarities of the nineteenth-century novel form. It\u2019s easy to understand in this context how a book as innovative and iconoclastic as Ulysses could be seen as striking the final blow against an already ailing literary tradition. In fact, it might be less easy to understand why, one hundred years later, the novel is still lumbering on, not yet superseded by any more popular or critically significant form of textual storytelling. Classical music, after all, effectively gave way to popular music in the twentieth century; figurative painting never again reasserted itself as a dominant cultural form. But novels as we know them are still being written and widely read. And as one of the people writing and reading them, I can\u2019t help but be interested in the question. What exactly did Ulysses do to the novel? And if we can\u2019t escape it, how can we go on?",

In 1923, the year after James Joyce\u2019s novel Ulysses was first published in its complete form, T. S.

His friend Virginia Woolf had described it in her diary as \u201can illiterate, underbred book \u2026 the book of a self-taught working man, & we all know how distressing they are.\u201d In comparison, Eliot\u2019s praise is triumphal. \u201cA book to which we are all indebted, and from which none of us can escape.\u201d And yet this proposed relationship between Ulysses and its readers may not seem altogether inviting either. Do we really want to read a novel in order to experience the sensation of inescapable debt? In the century since its publication, Ulysses has of course become a monument not only of modernist literature but of the novel itself. But it\u2019s also a notoriously \u201cdifficult\u201d book. Among all English-language novels, there may be no greater gulf between how much a work is celebrated and discussed, and how seldom it is actually read.  I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a ___________ that very soon after the publication of Ulysses, critics started to speculate that the novel as a form might be dying. In 1925, the Spanish philosopher Jose Ortega y Gasset wrote of the \u201cdecline of the novel,\u201d comparing the genre to a \u201cvast but finite quarry.\u201d \u201cWhen the quarry is worked out,\u201d he warned, \u201ctalent, however great, can achieve nothing.\u201d A few years later, in 1930, Walter Benjamin wrote of the \u201ccrisis of the novel.\u201d These two very different works, Ortega\u2019s book and Benjamin\u2019s short essay, both make reference, albeit in passing, to James Joyce. In fact, in T. S. Eliot\u2019s piece in praise of Ulysses, he remarks, \u201cIf it is not a novel, that is simply because the novel is a form which will no longer serve,\u201d and later adds that \u201cthe novel ended with Flaubert and with James.\u201d In the present day, the \u201cdeath of the novel\u201d is declared so regularly and with so little provocation that this might not seem to be of any great significance: but I don\u2019t know that the novel was ever declared dead even once before Ulysses was published.  Joyce was, as we know, writing at a time of enormous artistic and cultural upheaval. The seemingly stable conventions of classical music were being shattered by composers like Arnold Sch\u00f6nberg; the refined traditions of Western realist painting were revolutionized by the Cubism of Picasso and Braque. And writers like Marcel Proust were already beginning to destabilize the familiarities of the nineteenth-century novel form. It\u2019s easy to understand in this context how a book as innovative and iconoclastic as Ulysses could be seen as striking the final blow against an already ailing literary tradition. In fact, it might be less easy to understand why, one hundred years later, the novel is still lumbering on, not yet superseded by any more popular or critically significant form of textual storytelling. Classical music, after all, effectively gave way to popular music in the twentieth century; figurative painting never again reasserted itself as a dominant cultural form. But novels as we know them are still being written and widely read. And as one of the people writing and reading them, I can\u2019t help but be interested in the question.

        "summary": "Here\u2019s a structured **summary of core topics, concepts, and principles** for the **\"English 2 (Computer-Based Exam)\"** based on the provided question paper.\nThe exam focuses on **reading comprehension, vocabulary, grammar, discourse markers, literary analysis, and communication skills**. Below is a breakdown of the key areas:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Reading Comprehension & Literary Analysis**\n#### **Core Topics:**\n- **Understanding Passages:**\n  - Analyzing tone, intent, and context (e.g., T.S. Eliot\u2019s defense of *Ulysses*, critiques of modernist literature).\n  - Identifying **main ideas**, **supporting details**, and **inferences**.\n  - Recognizing **author\u2019s perspective** (e.g., Eliot\u2019s praise vs. Virginia Woolf\u2019s criticism).\n- **Literary Movements & Themes:**\n  - **Modernism** (e.g., *Ulysses* as a disruptive, innovative work).\n  - **Decline of traditional forms** (e.g., novel, classical music, painting) and the rise of new artistic expressions (e.g., Cubism, atonal music).\n  - **Cultural upheaval** in the early 20th century (e.g., Joyce, Proust, Picasso, Sch\u00f6nberg).\n- **Vocabulary in Context:**\n  - **Antonyms/Synonyms**: Words like *indebted* (antonym: *unappreciated*), *triumphal* (synonym: *jubilant*), *upheaval* (synonym: *disruption*), *innovative* (antonym: *unimaginative*).\n  - **Idioms/Expressions**: \"Play the fool,\" \"screwed-up,\" \"boob tube,\" \"cool as a cucumber\" (simile).\n  - **Discourse Markers**: *As a matter of fact, even though, consequently, additionally, basically*.\n\n#### **Key Takeaways:**\n- *Ulysses* is a **monumental but difficult** modernist novel, celebrated yet seldom read.\n- Modernism **challenged traditional forms** (e.g., novels, music, art).\n- **Critics\u2019 roles**: Defending or disparaging works (e.g., Eliot vs. Woolf).\n- **Cultural shifts**: Artistic movements (Cubism, atonal music) reflected broader societal changes.\n\n---\n\n### **2.
