        "summary": "Here\u2019s a structured **summary of core topics, concepts, principles, and equations** essential for the **Game Theory** exam, followed by **Mermaid knowledge graphs** to visualize relationships.\n\n---\n\n## **1. Core Topics & Concepts**\n### **A. Probability & Bayesian Games**\n- **Bayes' Theorem**:\n  Used to update probabilities based on new information (e.g., spam detection in Q2-Q3).\n  Key equation:\n  \\[\n  P(A|B) = \\frac{P(B|A) \\cdot P(A)}{P(B)}\n  \\]\n  Where:\n  - \\(P(A|B)\\): Posterior probability (e.g., probability email is spam given the phrase \"check this out\").\n  - \\(P(B|A)\\): Likelihood (e.g., probability of phrase given it's spam).\n  - \\(P(A)\\): Prior probability (e.g., 40% spam rate).\n  - \\(P(B)\\): Total probability of the phrase (from **Law of Total Probability**).\n\n- **Total Probability Rule** (Q2):\n  \\[\n  P(B) = P(B|A) \\cdot P(A) + P(B|\\neg A) \\cdot P(\\neg A)\n  \\]\n  Example (Q2):\n  \\[\n  P(\\text{\"check this out\"}) = 0.01 \\times 0.4 + 0.004 \\times 0.6 = 0.0064\n  \\]\n\n---\n\n### **B. Cooperative Game Theory**\n#### **1. Shapley Value** (Q4-Q6, Q18-Q21, Q28-Q29)\n- **Definition**: Fair distribution of payoffs in a coalition game.\n- **Formula**:\n  \\[\n  \\phi_i(v) = \\sum_{S \\subseteq N \\setminus \\{i\\}} \\frac{|S|! (n-|S|-1)!}{n!} [v(S \\cup \\{i\\}) - v(S)]\n  \\]\n  Where:\n  - \\(v(S)\\): Value of coalition \\(S\\).\n  - \\(n\\): Total players.\n- **Key Properties**:\n  - Efficiency: \\(\\sum \\phi_i = v(N)\\).\n  - Symmetry: Equal contributions \u2192 equal payoffs.\n  - Additivity: \\(\\phi_i(v_1 + v_2) = \\phi_i(v_1) + \\phi_i(v_2)\\).\n\n- **Example (Q4-Q6)**:\n  - **Cost allocation** for a cable network (tree graph).\n  - Shapley values for Players 1, 2, 3: **15, 15, 20** (sum = 50, total cost).\n\n- **Weighted Majority Games (Q18-Q21)**:\n  - Shapley value for \\([61, 61, 19, 20, 20]\\):\n    - \\(S_1 = 1\\), \\(S_2 = 0\\), \\(S_3 = 0\\), \\(S_4 = 0\\) (Players 1 and 2 are symmetric but only Player 1 is pivotal).\n\n#### **2. Coalition Function \\(v(S)\\)** (Q10-Q17, Q28-Q29)\n- **Definition**: Value a coalition \\(S\\) can achieve.\n- **Examples**:\n  - **Market Game (Q10-Q17)**:\n    - \\(v(1) = 2000\\) (seller\u2019s watch value).\n    - \\(v(2) = v(3) = 0\\) (buyers have no value alone).\n    - \\(v(1,2) = 2800\\), \\(v(1,3) = 3000\\), \\(v(1,2,3) = 3000\\).\n  - **Partnership Dissolution (Q28-Q29)**:\n    - \\(v(1,2,3) = 60\\) (total enterprise value).\n    - Shapley-like dissolution: Players get **16.67, 36.67, 6.67**.\n\n---\n\n### **C. Non-Cooperative Game Theory**\n#### **1. Nash Equilibrium (NE) & Subgame Perfect NE (SPNE)** (Q7-Q9, Q32-Q35)\n- **Nash Equilibrium**:\n  - Strategy profile where no player can unilaterally improve payoff.\n  - **Pure Strategy NE**: All players choose deterministic actions.\n  - **Mixed Strategy NE**: Players randomize over actions.\n\n- **Subgame Perfect NE (SPNE)**:\n  - NE that is also a NE in every subgame (refines NE using backward induction).\n\n- **Examples**:\n  - **Sequential Game (Q7-Q9)**:\n    - For \\(X > 1\\): **1 pure NE** (U).\n    - For \\(X < 1\\): **2 pure NEs** (U, L) and (D, R).\n    - **SPNE for \\(X < 1\\)**: (D, L).\n  - **Market Entry Game (Q34-Q36)**:\n    - Payoff: \\(\\frac{150}{n} - 62\\) (where \\(n\\) = number of entrants).\n    - **Pure NEs**: (0 entrants), (1 entrant), (2 entrants).\n    - **Mixed Strategy NE**: Each enters with probability \\(p = \\frac{4}{5}\\).\n\n#### **2. Dominance & Elimination** (Q32-Q33)\n- **Weak Dominance**:\n  - Strategy \\(s_i\\) weakly dominates \\(s_i'\\) if:\n    \\[\n    u_i(s_i, s_{-i}) \\geq u_i(s_i', s_{-i}) \\quad \\forall s_{-i}\n    \\]\n  - **Example (Q32)**:\n    - In the game:\n      |       | L   | R   |\n      |-------|-----|-----|\n      | **U** | 1,1 | 0,0 |\n      | **D** | 0,0 | 0,0 |\n    - **D is weakly dominated by U** (since \\(U\\) gives \\(\\geq\\) payoff for all opponent strategies).\n\n#### **3. Auctions** (Q30-Q31)\n- **First-Price Sealed Bid Auction**:\n  - Bidders submit bids simultaneously; highest bid wins and pays their bid.\n  - **Symmetric Equilibrium Bidding Strategy**:\n    \\[\n    b(v) = \\frac{n-1}{n} v\n    \\]\n    Where \\(n\\) = number of bidders, \\(v\\) = valuation.\n  - **Example (Q30)**:\n    - For \\(n=5\\), \\(v=0.75\\):\n      \\[\n      b(0.75) = \\frac{4}{5} \\times 0.75 = 0.6\n      \\]\n  - **Expected Revenue**:\n    \\[\n    \\text{Revenue} = \\frac{n-1}{n+1} \\quad \\text{(for uniform } [0,1] \\text{ valuations)}\n    \\]\n    For \\(n=5\\): \\(\\frac{4}{6} = \\frac{2}{3}\\).\n\n---\n\n### **D. Matching Markets (Gale-Shapley Algorithm)** (Q22-Q25)\n- **Stable Matching**:\n  - No pair \\((m,w)\\) prefers each other over their assigned partners.\n- **Gale-Shapley Algorithm**:\n  1. Unmatched men propose to their top-choice woman.\n  2. Women tentatively accept their best offer and reject others.\n  3. Repeat until all are matched.\n- **Example (Q22-Q25)**:\n  - **Women-proposing**: Results in:\n    - Mr. a: None\n    - Mr. b: C\n    - Mr. c: B\n    - Mr. d: A\n\n---\n\n### **E. Repeated Games & Folk Theorems** (Q40-Q42)\n- **Infinite Horizon Repeated Games**:\n  - Payoff for player \\(i\\):\n    \\[\n    (1 - \\delta) \\sum_{t=0}^{\\infty} \\delta^t u_i(a_t)\n    \\]\n    Where \\(\\delta\\) = discount factor.\n  - **Folk Theorem**:\n    - Any feasible, individually rational payoff can be a SPE for some \\(\\delta\\).\n  - **Example (Q41)**:\n    - Deviating from \\((0,0)\\) to get \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) requires solving:\n      \\[\n      -1 + \\delta \\times 0 \\geq \\frac{1}{4} + \\delta \\times (-1) \\implies \\delta \\leq \\frac{1}{2}\n      \\]\n    - For \\(\\delta > \\frac{1}{2}\\), cooperation is sustainable.\n\n---\n\n## **2.
