Core Topics & Concepts**\n### **A. Financial Accounting & Reporting**\n#### **Key Concepts:**\n1. **Contingent Liabilities**\n   - **Disclosure Rules**:\n     - If a liability is **possible but not probable**, disclose in **footnotes** (not on the balance sheet).\n     - If **probable and estimable**, record as a liability.\n   - *Example*: Lawsuit settlement (Q2).\n\n2. **Accrual Accounting**\n   - **Salary Accrual**:\n     - At the **beginning of the month**, hiring employees does **not** affect the balance sheet or income statement (Q9).\n     - At the **end of the month**, record:\n       - **Expense (Income Statement)**: +\u20b975,000\n       - **Liability (Balance Sheet)**: +\u20b975,000 (Accrued Salaries)\n\n3. **Liabilities Classification**\n   - **Current vs. Long-Term Liabilities**:\n     - **Current Liabilities**: Due within 1 year (e.g., current maturities of bank loans).\n     - **Long-Term Liabilities**: Due after 1 year (e.g., bonds payable, mortgage payable, lease liabilities) (Q10).\n\n4. **Cash Flow Statement (Financing Activities)**\n   - **Net Cash Flow Calculation**:\n     - **Inflows**: Proceeds from issuing shares/debt.\n     - **Outflows**: Loan repayments, dividends, share buybacks.\n     - *Formula*:\n       ```\n       Net Cash Flow = (Proceeds from Shares + Proceeds from Debt) - (Loan Repayments + Dividends + Share Buybacks)\n       ```\n     - *Example* (Q11):\n       ```\n       = (\u20b98,00,000 + \u20b93,00,000) - (\u20b94,50,000 + \u20b91,25,000 + \u20b92,50,000) = \u20b92,75,000\n       ```\n\n---\n\n### **B.
