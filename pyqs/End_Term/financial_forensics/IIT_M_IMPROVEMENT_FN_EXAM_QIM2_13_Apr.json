Core Topics & Concepts**\n### **A. Financial Mathematics & Valuation**\n#### **Key Concepts:**\n1. **Net Present Value (NPV)**\n   - Formula:\n     \\[\n     NPV = \\sum_{t=0}^{n} \\frac{CF_t}{(1 + r)^t} - \\text{Initial Investment}\n     \\]\n   - Used to evaluate project viability (Q2).\n   - **Rule:** Accept if NPV > 0.\n\n2. **Time Value of Money (TVM)**\n   - **Future Value (FV) of Annuity Due** (Q21):\n     \\[\n     FV = PMT \\times \\left( \\frac{(1 + r)^n - 1}{r} \\right) \\times (1 + r)\n     \\]\n   - **Present Value (PV) of Perpetuity Growing Annuity** (Q22):\n     \\[\n     PV = \\frac{CF_1}{r - g}\n     \\]\n     (where \\( g \\) = growth rate, \\( r \\) = discount rate).\n\n3. **Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)** (Q4, Q24)\n   - Formula:\n     \\[\n     E(R_i) = R_f + \\beta_i (E(R_m) - R_f)\n     \\]\n   - **Beta (\\(\\beta\\))**:\n     - \\(\\beta > 1\\): Stock is riskier than the market.\n     - \\(\\beta = 0\\): No correlation with the market (e.g., risk-free asset).\n     - \\(\\beta < 0\\): Inverse relationship with the market.\n   - **Key Insights from Q4:**\n     - If \\(\\text{Cov}(R_i, R_m) = 0\\), then \\(\\beta = 0\\).\n     - Risk-free rate (\\(R_f\\)) impacts expected return.\n\n4. **Levered vs. Unlevered Beta** (Q25)\n   - **Unlevering Beta**:\n     \\[\n     \\beta_U = \\frac{\\beta_L}{1 + (1 - T) \\frac{D}{E}}\n     \\]\n     (where \\( T \\) = tax rate, \\( D/E \\) = debt-to-equity ratio).\n\n5. **Return on Equity (ROE)** (Q23)\n   - **DuPont Formula**:\n     \\[\n     ROE = \\text{Profit Margin} \\times \\text{Asset Turnover} \\times \\text{Financial Leverage}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     \\text{Financial Leverage} = \\frac{\\text{Assets}}{\\text{Equity}}\n     \\]\n\n---\n\n#### **B. Financial Statements & Credit Analysis**\n1. **Creditor Safety Analysis** (Q3)\n   - **Key Metric:** **Days Payable Outstanding (DPO)**\n     \\[\n     DPO = \\frac{\\text{Creditors}}{\\text{Cost of Raw Materials Consumed}} \\times 365\n     \\]\n   - **Interpretation:**\n     - High DPO (e.g., 180 days in Q3) \u2192 **Risky** (delayed payments).\n     - Low DPO \u2192 **Safer** for creditors.\n\n2. **Credit Lifecycle** (Q14\u2013Q16)\n   - **Stages:**\n     1. **Propensity** (First step, Q16) \u2192 Identify potential customers.\n     2. **Underwriting** \u2192 Assess creditworthiness.\n     3. **Fraud Check** \u2192 Detect fraudulent applications.\n     4. **Reject Inferencing** \u2192 Analyze rejected applicants (not for approved apps, Q14).\n     5. **Collections** (Last step, Q15) \u2192 Recover dues.\n   - **Tools:**\n     - **Roll Rate Analysis** (Q26\u2013Q27): Measures transition between delinquency buckets.\n       \\[\n       \\text{Roll Forward Rate} = \\frac{\\text{Accounts rolling to worse state}}{\\text{Total accounts in bucket}}\n       \\]\n     - **Vintage Analysis**: Tracks performance of loans originated in the same period.\n\n3. **Default Definition** (Q13)\n   - **60\u201389 DPD (Days Past Due)** is typically considered a default.\n   - **Data Exclusion Rule:** Recent data (e.g., last 2 months) should be excluded to avoid look-ahead bias.\n\n---\n\n#### **C.
