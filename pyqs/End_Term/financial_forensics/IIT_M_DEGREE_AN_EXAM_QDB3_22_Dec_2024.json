Core Topics & Concepts**\n### **A. Financial Accounting & Reporting**\n#### **Key Concepts:**\n1. **Contingent Liabilities**\n   - **Disclosure Rules**:\n     - **Probable + Estimable** \u2192 Record as liability.\n     - **Possible but Not Probable** \u2192 Disclose in footnotes (not on balance sheet).\n     - **Remote** \u2192 No disclosure needed.\n   - *Example*: Lawsuit settlement (Q2) \u2192 **Footnote disclosure** (Option D).\n\n2. **Liabilities Classification**\n   - **Current Liabilities**: Due within 1 year (e.g., accounts payable, short-term debt).\n   - **Long-Term Liabilities**: Due >1 year (e.g., bonds, mortgages, leases).\n   - *Exception*: **Current maturities of long-term debt** (due within 1 year) are **current liabilities** (Q10).\n\n3. **Accrual Accounting**\n   - **Salary Accrual**: Expense recognized when incurred (not when paid).\n     - *Example*: \u20b975,000 salary at month-start \u2192 **No immediate cash impact** (liability increases) (Q9).\n\n4. **Cash Flow Statement**\n   - **Financing Activities**: Proceeds from debt/equity, dividends, buybacks.\n     - *Formula*:\n       ```\n       Net Cash Flow = (Proceeds from shares + New debt) - (Loan repayment + Dividends + Buybacks)\n       ```\n     - *Example* (Q11):\n       ```\n       = (\u20b9800K + \u20b9300K) - (\u20b9450K + \u20b9125K + \u20b9250K) = \u20b9275K\n       ```\n\n---\n\n### **B. Corporate Finance & Valuation**\n#### **Key Concepts:**\n1. **Time Value of Money (TVM)**\n   - **Present Value (PV)** of future cash flows:\n     ```\n     PV = \u03a3 [CF_t / (1 + r)^t]\n     ```\n   - *Example* (Q3): Salary + bonus discounted at 6.5%:\n     ```\n     PV = \u20b92,500 + \u20b948K/(1.065) + \u20b951K/(1.065)^2 + \u20b955K/(1.065)^3 \u2248 \u20b9147,610\n     ```\n\n2. **Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC)**\n   - *Formula*:\n     ```\n     WACC = (E/V * Re) + (D/V * Rd * (1 - Tax))\n     ```\n     where:\n     - `E` = Equity, `D` = Debt, `V` = E + D\n     - `Re` = Cost of Equity, `Rd` = Cost of Debt\n   - **Debt-Equity Ratio (D/E)**:\n     ```\n     D/E = (WACC - Re) / (Rd * (1 - Tax) - WACC) * (E/V)\n     ```\n   - *Example* (Q4): Target WACC = 9.5%, `Re` = 12.75%, `Rd` = 6.5% \u2192 **D/E = 1.08**.\n\n3. **DuPont Analysis**\n   - *Formula*:\n     ```\n     ROE = (Net Income / Sales) * (Sales / Assets) * (Assets / Equity)\n         = Profit Margin * Asset Turnover * Equity Multiplier\n     ```\n   - *Example* (Q5):\n     ```\n     ROE = 25% = 8% * 2.4 * (Assets/\u20b94,100)\n     \u2192 Net Income = ROE * Equity = 25% * \u20b94,100 = \u20b91,025\n     ```\n\n4. **Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)**\n   - *Formula*:\n     ```\n     Expected Return = Rf + \u03b2*(Rm - Rf)\n     ```\n   - **Beta (\u03b2)**: Measures systematic risk.\n     - **Linear relationship** between expected return and \u03b2 (Q6).\n\n5. **Internal Rate of Return (IRR)**\n   - **Decision Rule**:\n     - **IRR > Cost of Capital** \u2192 Accept project (Q7).\n\n---\n\n### **C. Credit Risk & Lending**\n#### **Key Concepts:**\n1. **Debt-Equity Ratio & Interest Coverage**\n   - **Times Interest Earned (TIE)** = EBIT / Interest Expense\n   - **Lower D/E + Higher TIE** \u2192 Lower default risk (Q8: **Company B**).\n\n2. **Credit Lifecycle**\n   - **Stages**:\n     1. **Propensity** (Marketing)\n     2. **Fraud Check**\n     3. **Underwriting**\n     4. **Reject Inferencing**\n     5. **Collections** (Final step) (Q21, Q22).\n\n3. **Default Definition & Model Training**\n   - **Roll Rate Analysis**: Tracks delinquency transitions (e.g., 30\u219260 DPD).\n   - **Reject Inferencing**: Adjusts for bias from rejected applicants.\n   - *Example* (Q20): **Both** used for target variable definition.\n   - **Data Exclusion**: Recent data (e.g., last 2 months) may be unstable (Q19: Exclude **Sep\u2013Nov 2024**).\n\n4. **Model Performance Metrics**\n   - **Recall (Sensitivity)** = TP / (TP + FN)\n   - **Precision** = TP / (TP + FP)\n   - *Example* (Q15): Predict all positive in 1:99 imbalance \u2192 **Recall = 100%, Precision = 1%**.\n   - **Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) Statistic**: Measures model discrimination.\n     - *Example* (Q16): Max KS = **57.72%**.\n   - **Capture Rate**: % of bads captured at a threshold.\n     - *Example* (Q17): Top 10% capture rate = **63.77%**.\n\n---\n\n### **D.

Time Series Forecasting**\n#### **Key Concepts:**\n1. **Trend + Seasonality**\n   - *Example* (Q13):\n     ```\n     Trend: +5 units/quarter \u2192 5*20 = +100 (5 years = 20 quarters)\n     Seasonality: Q4 \u2192 +20\n     Q1 Year 1 = 200 \u2192 Q4 Year 5 = 200 + 100 + 20 = 320 (but adjusted for seasonal pattern \u2192 **315**)\n     ```\n\n2. **Autocorrelation (ACF)**\n   - Measures correlation between `Y_t` and `Y_{t-k}` (Q14).\n\n---\n\n### **F. Vector Similarity (Cosine Similarity)**\n#### **Key Concepts:**\n1. **Cosine Similarity**:\n   ```\n   cos(\u03b8) = (A\u00b7B) / (||A|| * ||B||)\n   ```\n   - *Example* (Q27\u2013Q30):\n     - **Highest similarity**: A & B (**0.986**).\n     - **Least similarity**: C & D.\n     - **Best triplet**: A, B, D.\n\n---\n\n## **2.
