        "summary": "Here\u2019s a structured **summary of core topics, concepts, principles, and equations** essential for the exam, followed by **Mermaid knowledge graphs** to visualize relationships.\n\n---\n\n## **Core Topics & Key Concepts**\n### **1. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**\n- **Goal**: Dimensionality reduction by projecting data onto orthogonal axes (principal components) that maximize variance.\n- **Steps**:\n  1. Center the data (subtract mean).\n  2. Compute covariance matrix \\( \\Sigma = \\frac{1}{n} X^T X \\).\n  3. Eigenvalue decomposition: \\( \\Sigma = U \\Lambda U^T \\), where \\( U \\) contains eigenvectors (principal components) and \\( \\Lambda \\) contains eigenvalues (variances).\n  4. Project data onto top-\\( k \\) eigenvectors: \\( X_{\\text{proj}} = X U_k \\).\n- **Variance along PC1**: Largest eigenvalue of \\( \\Sigma \\).\n- **Reconstruction Error**: Sum of variances of discarded components.\n  - If top-\\( k \\) PCs retain all variance, error = 0 (Q3).\n- **Key Equations**:\n  - Covariance matrix: \\( \\Sigma = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\mu)(x_i - \\mu)^T \\).\n  - Variance along PC1: \\( \\lambda_1 \\) (largest eigenvalue).\n\n---\n\n### **2. Probability & Bayesian Estimation**\n- **Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) Estimate**:\n  - \\( \\hat{\\theta}_{\\text{MAP}} = \\arg \\max_\\theta p(\\theta | X) \\propto p(X | \\theta) p(\\theta) \\).\n  - For Uniform prior \\( \\theta \\sim \\text{Uniform}[0, 60] \\) and likelihood \\( X \\sim \\text{Uniform}[0, \\theta] \\), MAP = max observed value (Q4: \\( \\hat{\\theta} = 52 \\)).\n\n---\n\n### **3. Logistic Regression & Classification Metrics**\n- **Threshold Adjustment**:\n  - Low threshold \u2192 High recall (fewer false negatives, e.g., spam detection; Q5: **1**).\n  - High threshold \u2192 High precision (fewer false positives).\n- **Na\u00efve Bayes**:\n  - Assumes feature independence given class: \\( p(x|y) = \\prod_i p(x_i|y) \\).\n  - Parameters \\( \\hat{p}_i^y \\): Empirical frequencies (Q10\u2013Q12).\n    - Example: \\( b = p(x_1=1|y=1) = \\frac{\\text{Count}(x_1=1, y=1)}{\\text{Count}(y=1)} \\).\n\n---\n\n### **4. Clustering (k-Means)**\n- **Properties**:\n  - Sensitive to outliers (Q6: **B**).\n  - Initialization affects convergence speed (Q6: **D**).\n  - Not guaranteed to converge to global optimum.\n- **Algorithm**:\n  1. Initialize centroids.\n  2. Assign points to nearest centroid.\n  3. Recompute centroids.\n  4. Repeat until convergence.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Model Training & Validation**\n- **Training vs. Validation Loss**:\n  - Training loss (Curve A) decreases monotonically.\n  - Validation loss (Curve D) may increase if overfitting (Q7: **A, D**).\n- **Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV)**:\n  - Error: \\( \\text{error}_L = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \\hat{f}^{-i}(x_i))^2 \\).\n  - For \\( \\hat{f} = \\beta x \\), solve \\( \\beta \\) using least squares on \\( n-1 \\) points (Q13).\n\n---\n\n### **6. Optimization & Gradient Descent**\n- **Gradient Descent Update**:\n  - \\( w_{t+1} = w_t - \\eta \\nabla f(w_t) \\).\n  - For linear regression: \\( \\nabla f(w) = 2 X^T (X w - y) \\) (Q8).\n- **Lagrangian & Constrained Optimization**:\n  - \\( L(x, \\lambda) = f(x) + \\lambda g(x) \\).\n  - For \\( \\min x_1^2 + 2x_2 \\) s.t. \\( x_1 - x_2 \\leq 3 \\), evaluate \\( L(x', \\lambda) \\) at \\( x' = [1, 4] \\) (Q14: **A**).\n\n---\n\n### **7. Support Vector Machines (SVM)**\n- **Soft-Margin SVM**:\n  - Slack variables \\( \\xi_i \\): Measure violation of margin constraints.\n  - \\( \\xi_i = 0 \\) if point is on correct side of margin (Q19\u2013Q22).\n  - \\( \\xi_i = \\) distance to margin if misclassified or within margin.\n- **Support Vectors**:\n  - Points on margin boundaries (\\( w^T x = \\pm 1 \\)).\n  - Removing non-support vectors does not change the model (Q16: **B**).\n\n---\n\n### **8. Ensemble Methods**\n- **AdaBoost**:\n  - Weights of correctly classified points are **decreased** (Q17: **B**).\n  - Weak learners: Slightly better than random (Q15: **C**).\n- **Bagging**:\n  - Estimators can be trained in parallel (Q15: **D**).\n\n---\n\n### **9. Bias-Variance Tradeoff**\n- **Underfitting**: High bias, low variance (Q15: **A is incorrect**).\n- **Overfitting**: High variance, low bias (e.g., deep decision trees; Q15: **B**).\n\n---\n\n## **Mermaid Knowledge Graphs**\n### **Graph 1: Dimensionality Reduction & PCA**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[High-Dimensional Data] --> B[Center Data]\n    B --> C[Compute Covariance Matrix]\n    C --> D[Eigenvalue Decomposition]\n    D --> E[Principal Components]\n    E --> F[Project Data]\n    F --> G[Variance Maximization]\n    G --> H[Reconstruction Error]\n    H -->|If top-k PCs retain all variance| I[Error = 0]\n```\n\n### **Graph 2: Classification & Probabilistic Models**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Classification Task] --> B[Logistic Regression]\n    A --> C[Na\u00efve Bayes]\n    B --> D[Threshold Tuning]\n    D -->|Low Threshold| E[High Recall]\n    D -->|High Threshold| F[High Precision]\n    C --> G[Feature Independence]\n    G --> H[Empirical Frequencies]\n    H --> I[Predict Class]\n```\n\n### **Graph 3: Model Evaluation & Optimization**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Model Training] --> B[Loss Curves]\n    B --> C[Training Loss]\n    B --> D[Validation Loss]\n    C -->|Decreases Monotonically| E[Underfitting/Overfitting]\n    D -->|U-Shaped| E\n    A --> F[Gradient Descent]\n    F --> G[Update Weights]\n    G --> H[Learning Rate]\n    A --> I[Cross-Validation]\n    I --> J[LOOCV Error]\n```\n\n### **Graph 4: SVM & Ensemble Methods**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[SVM] --> B[Soft Margin]\n    B --> C[Slack Variables]\n    C --> D[\u03bei = 0 if Correctly Classified]\n    C --> E[\u03bei > 0 if Misclassified]\n    A --> F[Support Vectors]\n    F --> G[Margin Boundaries]\n    A --> H[Kernel Trick]\n    I[Ensemble Methods] --> J[AdaBoost]\n    J --> K[Weight Updates]\n    K -->|Correctly Classified| L[Decrease Weight]\n    I --> M[Bagging]\n    M --> N[Parallel Training]\n```\n\n### **Graph 5: Clustering & Probability**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[k-Means] --> B[Initialization]\n    B --> C[Centroids]\n    C --> D[Assign Points]\n    D --> E[Recompute Centroids]\n    E -->|Convergence| F[Final Clusters]\n    A --> G[Sensitive to Outliers]\n    H[Bayesian Estimation] --> I[MAP Estimate]\n    I --> J[Prior + Likelihood]\n    J --> K[Posterior Mode]\n```",
