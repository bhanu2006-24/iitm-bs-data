        "summary": "Here\u2019s a structured **summary of core topics, concepts, principles, and equations** essential for the exam, followed by **Mermaid knowledge graphs** to visualize relationships.\n\n---\n\n## **Core Topics & Concepts**\n### **1. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**\n- **Goal**: Dimensionality reduction by projecting data onto orthogonal axes (principal components) that maximize variance.\n- **Steps**:\n  1. Center the data (subtract mean).\n  2. Compute covariance matrix: \\( \\Sigma = \\frac{1}{n} X^T X \\).\n  3. Eigenvalue decomposition: \\( \\Sigma = U \\Lambda U^T \\).\n  4. Sort eigenvalues \\( \\lambda_1 \\geq \\lambda_2 \\geq \\dots \\geq \\lambda_d \\).\n  5. Project data onto top \\( k \\) eigenvectors (principal components).\n- **Variance along PC1**: For a dataset \\( \\{ \\pm \\mathbf{u}, \\pm 2\\mathbf{u} \\} \\), the variance along the first PC is the largest eigenvalue of the covariance matrix.\n  - **Equation**:\n    \\[\n    \\text{Variance} = \\lambda_1 = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\bar{x})^2 \\cdot \\mathbf{u}_1^T \\mathbf{u}_1\n    \\]\n  - For Q2, the variance is **2.5** (scaled by the eigenvalues of the structured dataset).\n\n- **Reconstruction Error**: If data lies in a subspace spanned by \\( k \\) PCs, retaining \\( k \\) components gives **zero reconstruction error** (Q3).\n\n---\n\n### **2. Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) Estimation**\n- **Goal**: Estimate parameter \\( \\theta \\) by maximizing the posterior distribution \\( P(\\theta | \\text{data}) \\).\n- **Prior**: \\( \\theta \\sim \\text{Uniform}[0, 60] \\).\n- **Likelihood**: For \\( X_i \\sim \\text{Uniform}[0, \\theta] \\), the likelihood is:\n  \\[\n  L(\\theta) = \\prod_{i=1}^n \\frac{1}{\\theta} \\cdot \\mathbb{I}(0 \\leq X_i \\leq \\theta)\n  \\]\n- **Posterior**: \\( P(\\theta | \\text{data}) \\propto L(\\theta) \\cdot \\text{Prior}(\\theta) \\).\n- **MAP Estimate**: \\( \\hat{\\theta}_{MAP} = \\max(X_i) \\) (for uniform prior and likelihood).\n  - For Q4, \\( \\hat{\\theta}_{MAP} = 52 \\).\n\n---\n\n### **3. Logistic Regression & Class Imbalance**\n- **Threshold Adjustment**:\n  - **Low threshold**: Increases **recall** (catches more positives, e.g., phishing emails) but may increase **false positives**.\n  - **High threshold**: Increases **precision** (fewer false positives) but may miss positives.\n- **Trade-off**: For safety-critical applications (e.g., spam detection), prioritize **recall** (low threshold).\n  - Q5 answer: **1** (low threshold).\n\n---\n\n### **4. k-Means Clustering**\n- **Sensitivity to Initialization**:\n  - Different initializations can lead to different local optima.\n  - **Outliers** can distort cluster centers.\n- **Convergence**: Guaranteed to converge (but may not be globally optimal).\n- **Key Points**:\n  - **B. k-means is sensitive to outliers**.\n  - **D. Initialization affects convergence speed**.\n  - Q6 correct options: **B, D**.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Training vs. Validation Loss Curves**\n- **Training Loss**: Decreases monotonically as the model fits the training data.\n- **Validation Loss**:\n  - Decreases initially, then may increase if **overfitting** occurs.\n- **Identification**:\n  - **Curve A (lower)**: Training loss.\n  - **Curve B (higher)**: Validation loss.\n  - Q7 correct options: **A, D**.\n\n---\n\n### **6. Gradient Descent for Linear Regression**\n- **Objective**: Minimize \\( f(w) = ||X^T w - y||^2 \\).\n- **Update Rule**:\n  \\[\n  w_{t+1} = w_t - \\eta \\nabla f(w_t)\n  \\]\n  where \\( \\nabla f(w) = 2 X (X^T w - y) \\).\n- **Q8 Calculation**:\n  - Given \\( X, y, w_0, \\eta \\), compute gradient and update \\( w \\).\n  - Correct answer: \\( w_1 = [0.76, -0.02]^T \\).\n\n---\n\n### **7. Perceptron Algorithm**\n- **Update Rule**: For misclassified point \\( (\\mathbf{x}_i, y_i) \\):\n  \\[\n  \\mathbf{w}^{t+1} = \\mathbf{w}^t + \\eta \\cdot y_i \\mathbf{x}_i\n  \\]\n  (where \\( \\eta \\) is the learning rate, often set to 1).\n- **Q9 Steps**:\n  1.

For \\( (\\mathbf{x}_2, y_2) \\), no update (already correctly classified).\n  - Correct answer: **A**.\n\n---\n\n### **8. Na\u00efve Bayes Classifier**\n- **Assumption**: Features are conditionally independent given the class.\n- **Parameters**: \\( \\hat{p}_i^y = P(x_i = 1 | y) \\).\n- **Estimation**:\n  - For binary features, \\( \\hat{p}_i^y = \\frac{\\text{Count}(x_i = 1, y)}{\\text{Count}(y)} \\).\n- **Q10-Q12**:\n  - \\( a + b = 1 \\) (complementary probabilities for feature 1).\n  - \\( b + d + f = 2 \\) (sum of probabilities for \\( y = 1 \\)).\n  - Predicted label for \\( [1, 0, 1]^T \\): **1** (higher posterior for \\( y = 1 \\)).\n\n---\n\n### **9. Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV)**\n- **Error Calculation**:\n  \\[\n  \\text{error}_L = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \\hat{f}^{-i}(x_i))^2\n  \\]\n- **Q13**:\n  - Fit \\( \\hat{f} = \\beta x \\) to \\( D = \\{(1,2), (2,3), (3,4)\\} \\).\n  - LOOCV errors: \\( (2-1.5)^2, (3-2.5)^2, (4-3)^2 \\).\n  - Average error: **0.33** (rounded to 2 decimal places).\n\n---\n\n### **10. Lagrangian & Constrained Optimization**\n- **Lagrangian**: \\( L(x, \\lambda) = f(x) + \\lambda g(x) \\).\n- **Dual Problem**: \\( \\max_{\\lambda \\geq 0} L(x', \\lambda) \\).\n- **Q14**:\n  - For \\( x' = [1, 4]^T \\), constraint \\( 1 - 4 \\leq 3 \\) is satisfied (\\( \\lambda = 0 \\)).\n  - \\( \\max L = f(x') = 1^2 + 2 \\cdot 4 = 9 \\).\n  - Correct answer: **A** (\\( x_1^2 + 2x_2 \\)).\n\n---\n\n### **11. Model Complexity & Bias-Variance Trade-off**\n- **Underfitting**: High bias, low variance.\n- **Overfitting**: Low bias, high variance.\n- **Q15 Incorrect Statement**:\n  - **A. Underfitted models have less bias** (false; they have high bias).\n\n---\n\n### **12. Support Vector Machines (SVM)**\n- **Support Vectors**: Points lying on the margin boundaries (\\( \\mathbf{w}^T \\mathbf{x} = \\pm 1 \\)).\n- **Slack Variables (\\( \\xi_i \\))**: Measure violation of margin constraints.\n  - \\( \\xi_i = 0 \\) if point is correctly classified and outside the margin.\n  - \\( \\xi_i > 0 \\) if point violates the margin.\n- **Q16**: Removing non-support vectors **does not change the model**.\n- **Q19-Q22**:\n  - \\( \\xi_1 = 0 \\) (on the margin).\n  - \\( \\xi_4 = 1 \\) (violates margin by 1 unit).\n  - \\( \\xi_6 = 2 \\) (violates margin by 2 units).\n\n---\n\n### **13. AdaBoost**\n- **Weight Update**: Increase weights for **misclassified** points, decrease for **correctly classified** points.\n- **Q17 Correct Option**:\n  - **B. Weight decreases if classified correctly**.\n\n---\n\n### **14. Model Complexity & Test Error**\n- **Not Always True**: Increasing complexity **does not always** increase test error (may decrease if model was underfitting).\n- **Q18 Answer**: **False**.\n\n---\n\n## **Mermaid Knowledge Graphs**\n### **Graph 1: PCA & Dimensionality Reduction**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[PCA] --> B[Center Data]\n    A --> C[Compute Covariance Matrix]\n    C --> D[Eigenvalue Decomposition]\n    D --> E[Sort Eigenvalues]\n    E --> F[Project onto Top k PCs]\n    F --> G[Variance Maximization]\n    G --> H[Reconstruction Error]\n    H --> I[Zero if Data Lies in Subspace]\n```\n\n### **Graph 2: MAP Estimation & Bayesian Learning**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[MAP Estimation] --> B[Prior Distribution]\n    A --> C[Likelihood]\n    B --> D[Uniform Prior]\n    C --> E[Uniform Likelihood]\n    D & E --> F[Posterior]\n    F --> G[Maximize Posterior]\n    G --> H[MAP = max(X_i)]\n```\n\n### **Graph 3: Logistic Regression & Class Imbalance**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Logistic Regression] --> B[Threshold]\n    B --> C[Low Threshold]\n    B --> D[High Threshold]\n    C --> E[High Recall]\n    C --> F[More False Positives]\n    D --> G[High Precision]\n    D --> H[More False Negatives]\n    E & F --> I[Safety-Critical: Prioritize Recall]\n```\n\n### **Graph 4: k-Means & Clustering**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[k-Means] --> B[Initialize Centers]\n    A --> C[Assign Points to Clusters]\n    A --> D[Update Centers]\n    B --> E[Sensitive to Initialization]\n    C --> F[Outliers Distort Centers]\n    D --> G[Convergence Guaranteed]\n    E & F --> H[Local Optima]\n```\n\n### **Graph 5: SVM & Slack Variables**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[SVM] --> B[Maximize Margin]\n    A --> C[Slack Variables]\n    B --> D[Support Vectors]\n    C --> E[Measure Margin Violation]\n    D --> F[Points on w^T x = \u00b11]\n    E --> G[\u03be_i = 0 if Correctly Classified]\n    E --> H[\u03be_i > 0 if Misclassified]\n```\n\n### **Graph 6: Model Evaluation & Bias-Variance**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Model Evaluation] --> B[Training Loss]\n    A --> C[Validation Loss]\n    B --> D[Decreases Monotonically]\n    C --> E[U-Shaped Curve]\n    E --> F[Overfitting if Validation Loss Rises]\n    A --> G[LOOCV]\n    G --> H[Average Squared Error]\n```",
