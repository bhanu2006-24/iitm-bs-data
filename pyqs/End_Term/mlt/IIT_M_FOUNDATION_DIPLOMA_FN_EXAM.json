Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**\n- **Purpose**: Dimensionality reduction by projecting data onto orthogonal axes (principal components) that maximize variance.\n- **Steps**:\n  1. Center the data (subtract mean).\n  2. Compute covariance matrix: \\( \\Sigma = \\frac{1}{n} X^T X \\).\n  3. Eigenvalue decomposition: \\( \\Sigma = U \\Lambda U^T \\), where \\( \\Lambda \\) contains eigenvalues, \\( U \\) contains eigenvectors.\n  4. Sort eigenvectors by descending eigenvalues; top \\( k \\) eigenvectors form the projection matrix.\n  5. Project data: \\( X_{\\text{new}} = X U_k \\).\n- **Variance along PC1**: For a dataset aligned along a single direction (e.g., scalar multiples of a vector), the variance along the first PC is the largest eigenvalue of the covariance matrix.\n  - **Equation**: If data points are \\( \\{ \\alpha_i \\mathbf{u} \\} \\), the covariance matrix is \\( \\sigma^2 \\mathbf{u} \\mathbf{u}^T \\), and the top eigenvalue is \\( \\sigma^2 \\sum \\alpha_i^2 \\).\n  - **Example (Q2)**: For \\( \\{ -2\\mathbf{u}, -\\mathbf{u}, \\mathbf{u}, 2\\mathbf{u} \\} \\), variance along PC1 = **2.5**.\n\n- **Reconstruction Error**: If you retain only the top \\( k \\) PCs, the error is the sum of the discarded eigenvalues.\n  - **Equation**: \\( \\text{Error} = \\sum_{i=k+1}^d \\lambda_i \\).\n  - **Example (Q3)**: If the data lies in a 2D subspace, retaining 2 PCs gives **0 error**.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) Estimation**\n- **Purpose**: Estimate parameters by maximizing the posterior distribution.\n- **Equation**: \\( \\hat{\\theta}_{\\text{MAP}} = \\arg \\max_\\theta \\, p(\\theta | \\mathbf{X}) = \\arg \\max_\\theta \\, p(\\mathbf{X} | \\theta) p(\\theta) \\).\n- **Uniform Prior**: For \\( X_i \\sim \\text{Uniform}[0, \\theta] \\) and prior \\( \\theta \\sim \\text{Uniform}[0, 60] \\), the posterior is:\n  \\[\n  p(\\theta | \\mathbf{X}) \\propto \\begin{cases}\n  \\theta^{-n} & \\text{if } \\theta \\geq \\max(X_i), \\\\\n  0 & \\text{otherwise}.\n  \\end{cases}\n  \\]\n  - **MAP Estimate**: \\( \\hat{\\theta}_{\\text{MAP}} = \\max(X_i) \\).\n  - **Example (Q4)**: For data \\( \\{10, 55, \\ldots\\} \\), MAP estimate = **55**.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Logistic Regression & Class Imbalance**\n- **Threshold Adjustment**: Lowering the decision threshold (e.g., from 0.5 to 0.3) increases **recall** (reduces false negatives) but may increase false positives.\n  - **Example (Q5)**: For spam detection, prioritize recall (detect all phishing emails) \u2192 **threshold = 1 (low)**.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV)**\n- **Purpose**: Estimate model generalization error by leaving out one data point at a time.\n- **Error Formula**:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Error}_{\\text{LOOCV}} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \\hat{f}^{-i}(x_i))^2,\n  \\]\n  where \\( \\hat{f}^{-i} \\) is the model trained without the \\( i \\)-th point.\n- **Example (Q6)**: For \\( D = \\{(1,2), (2,2), (0,1)\\} \\) and model \\( \\hat{f} = \\beta x \\), LOOCV error = **2**.\n\n---\n\n### **5. K-Means Clustering**\n- **Algorithm Steps**:\n  1. **Initialize**: Randomly assign cluster centers.\n  2. **Assign**: Assign each point to the nearest center.\n  3. **Update**: Recompute centers as the mean of assigned points.\n  4. **Repeat**: Steps 2\u20133 until convergence.\n- **Correct Sequence (Q7)**: 3 (initialize) \u2192 1 (assign) \u2192 4 (update) \u2192 2 (reassign).\n\n---\n\n### **6. Lagrangian & Constrained Optimization**\n- **Lagrangian Function**: For a problem \\( \\min f(x) \\) s.t. \\( g(x) \\geq 0 \\), the Lagrangian is:\n  \\[\n  L(x, \\lambda) = f(x) - \\lambda g(x).\n  \\]\n- **Dual Problem**: \\( \\max_{\\lambda \\geq 0} L(x', \\lambda) \\).\n  - If \\( x' \\) violates constraints, the dual tends to \\( +\\infty \\).\n  - **Example (Q8)**: For \\( x' = [1, 4] \\) and constraint \\( x_1 - x_2 \\geq 3 \\), \\( \\max L = +\\infty \\). But the correct answer is **89** (likely a miscalculation in the problem).\n\n---\n\n### **7. Gradient Descent for Linear Regression**\n- **Objective**: Minimize \\( f(w) = \\|X^T w - y\\|^2 \\).\n- **Update Rule**:\n  \\[\n  w_{t+1} = w_t - \\eta \\nabla f(w_t),\n  \\]\n  where \\( \\nabla f(w) = 2 X (X^T w - y) \\).\n- **Example (Q9)**:\n  - Given \\( X = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & -2 & 0 \\\\ 2 & 5 & 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\), \\( y = [1, 6, 1]^T \\), \\( w_0 = [1, 0.5]^T \\), \\( \\eta = 0.05 \\).\n  - After one iteration: \\( w_1 = [-0.2, 3.1]^T \\).\n\n---\n\n### **8. Perceptron Algorithm**\n- **Update Rule**: For misclassified point \\( (\\mathbf{x}_i, y_i) \\):\n  \\[\n  \\mathbf{w}^{t+1} = \\mathbf{w}^t + \\eta y_i \\mathbf{x}_i.\n  \\]\n- **Example (Q10)**:\n  - \\( \\mathbf{w}^t = [0, 1, 2]^T \\), \\( (\\mathbf{x}_1, y_1) = ([1, -1, 0]^T, 1) \\).\n  - \\( \\mathbf{w}^{t+1} = [1, 0, 2]^T \\).\n  - Next point \\( (\\mathbf{x}_2, y_2) = ([-1, 1, 1]^T, -1) \\).\n  - \\( \\mathbf{w}^{t+2} = [2, -1, 1]^T \\).\n\n---\n\n### **9. Support Vector Machines (SVM)**\n- **Key Concepts**:\n  - **Support Vectors**: Points lying on the margin boundaries (\\( w^T x = \\pm 1 \\)).\n  - **Slack Variables (\\( \\xi_i \\))**: Measure violation of margin constraints.\n  - **Soft-Margin SVM**: Minimize \\( \\|w\\|^2 + C \\sum \\xi_i \\).\n- **Impact of Removing Non-Support Vectors (Q11)**: **No change** to the model (only support vectors define the decision boundary).\n- **Slack Variables (Q19\u2013Q23)**:\n  - \\( \\xi_i = 0 \\) if point is correctly classified and outside the margin.\n  - \\( \\xi_i = \\) distance from the margin if misclassified or inside the margin.\n  - Examples:\n    - \\( \\xi_1 = 0 \\) (Q20), \\( \\xi_2 = 0 \\) (Q21), \\( \\xi_6 = 2 \\) (Q22).\n\n---\n\n### **10. AdaBoost**\n- **Weight Update**: Increase weights for misclassified points, decrease for correctly classified.\n  - **Example (Q12)**: Weights decrease if classified **correctly** in round \\( t \\).\n\n---\n\n### **11. Bias-Variance Tradeoff & Model Complexity**\n- **Underfitting**: High bias, low variance.\n- **Overfitting**: Low bias, high variance.\n- **Key Points (Q13, Q15)**:\n  - Increasing model complexity **does not always** increase test error (it may decrease initially).\n  - **Decision Trees**: Maximum depth can lead to **overfitting (B)**.\n  - **Weak Learners**: Slightly better than random (C).\n  - **Bagging**: Estimators can be trained in parallel (D).\n\n---\n\n### **12. Naive Bayes**\n- **Assumption**: Features are conditionally independent given the class.\n- **Parameter Estimation**: For binary features \\( x_i \\in \\{0,1\\} \\), estimate \\( P(x_i = 1 | y) \\).\n  - **Example (Q16\u2013Q18)**:\n    - Dataset: 4 points with \\( y=1 \\), 4 with \\( y=0 \\).\n    - \\( a + b = 1 \\) (Q16), \\( b + d + f = 2 \\) (Q17).\n    - Predicted label for \\( [0, ?, ?]^T \\): **1** (Q18, likely due to higher \\( P(y=1) \\)).\n\n---\n\n### **13. Loss Curves (Training vs. Validation)**\n- **Training Loss**: Decreases monotonically.\n- **Validation Loss**: May increase if overfitting.\n- **Example (Q14)**: Curve A (steep decrease) = **training loss**; Curve B (levels off) = **validation loss**.\n\n---\n\n## **Mermaid Knowledge Graphs**\n### **1.
