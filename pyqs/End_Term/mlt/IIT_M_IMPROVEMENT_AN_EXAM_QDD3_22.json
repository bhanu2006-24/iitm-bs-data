        "summary": "Here\u2019s a structured **summary of core topics, concepts, principles, and equations** for the exam, followed by **Mermaid knowledge graphs** to visualize relationships.\n\n---\n\n## **Core Topics & Key Concepts**\n### **1. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**\n- **Purpose**: Dimensionality reduction while preserving variance.\n- **Steps**:\n  1. Standardize data (mean=0, variance=1).\n  2. Compute covariance matrix: \\( \\Sigma = \\frac{1}{n} X^T X \\).\n  3. Eigen-decomposition: \\( \\Sigma = U \\Lambda U^T \\), where \\( \\Lambda \\) contains eigenvalues \\( \\lambda_1 \\geq \\lambda_2 \\geq ... \\geq \\lambda_d \\).\n  4. Project data onto top \\( k \\) eigenvectors (principal components).\n- **Variance along PC1**: For a dataset \\( \\{ \\alpha_1 \\mathbf{u}, \\alpha_2 \\mathbf{u}, ..., \\alpha_n \\mathbf{u} \\} \\), the variance along the first PC is the largest eigenvalue of \\( \\Sigma \\).\n  - If data is scaled multiples of \\( \\mathbf{u} \\), variance = \\( \\text{Var}(\\alpha) \\cdot \\|\\mathbf{u}\\|^2 \\).\n  - **Equation**:\n    \\[\n    \\text{Variance along PC1} = \\lambda_1 = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n (\\alpha_i - \\bar{\\alpha})^2 \\cdot \\|\\mathbf{u}\\|^2\n    \\]\n- **Reconstruction Error**: If you retain \\( k \\) PCs, the error is the sum of discarded eigenvalues:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Error} = \\sum_{i=k+1}^d \\lambda_i\n  \\]\n  - If data lies in a \\( k \\)-dimensional subspace, error = 0.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) Estimation**\n- **Prior + Likelihood \u2192 Posterior**:\n  \\[\n  f(\\theta | X) \\propto P(X | \\theta) \\cdot P(\\theta)\n  \\]\n- **Uniform Prior**: For \\( \\theta \\sim \\text{Uniform}[0, b] \\), the posterior is:\n  \\[\n  f(\\theta | X) \\propto \\mathbb{I}_{[0, b]}(\\theta) \\cdot \\prod_{i=1}^n \\mathbb{I}_{[0, \\theta]}(x_i)\n  \\]\n  - **MAP Estimate**: Mode of the posterior. For Uniform[0,60] prior and data \\( X = \\{x_1, ..., x_n\\} \\), MAP is \\( \\max(x_i) \\) if \\( \\max(x_i) \\leq 60 \\), else 60.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Logistic Regression & Class Imbalance**\n- **Decision Boundary**: \\( \\sigma(\\mathbf{w}^T \\mathbf{x}) \\geq t \\), where \\( t \\) is the threshold.\n  - **Low Threshold (t \u2192 0)**: High recall (few false negatives), high false positives.\n  - **High Threshold (t \u2192 1)**: High precision (few false positives), high false negatives.\n- **Trade-off**: For spam detection (prioritize recall), set **low threshold (answer = 1)**.\n\n---\n\n### **4. k-Means Clustering**\n- **Sensitive to**:\n  - Initialization (different centroids \u2192 different results).\n  - Outliers (pulls centroids away).\n- **Convergence**: Guaranteed to converge (but may be local minima).\n- **Key Points**:\n  - Initialization affects iterations to converge (Option D).\n  - Outliers can distort clusters (Option B).\n\n---\n\n### **5. Training vs. Validation Loss Curves**\n- **Training Loss**: Decreases monotonically (model fits training data).\n- **Validation Loss**:\n  - Decreases initially, then may increase (overfitting).\n  - **Curve A**: Training loss (lower, smoother).\n  - **Curve B**: Validation loss (higher, may rise later).\n\n---\n\n### **6.
