Clustering (K-Means)**\n- **Goal**: Partition data into *k* clusters by minimizing **Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS)**.\n- **Key Idea**:\n  - For **perfect negative correlation (r = -1)**, data lies on a straight line.\n  - Optimal cluster centers for *k=3* will also lie **on the same line** (minimizes WCSS).\n- **Equation**:\n  \\[\n  \\text{WCSS} = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\sum_{\\mathbf{x} \\in C_i} \\|\\mathbf{x} - \\mu_i\\|^2\n  \\]\n  where \\( \\mu_i \\) = centroid of cluster \\( C_i \\).\n\n---\n\n### **2. Bias-Variance Tradeoff**\n- **Bias**: Error due to overly simplistic assumptions (underfitting).\n  - **High bias**: Linear models (e.g., \\( \\hat{y} = w_0 + w_1 x \\)).\n- **Variance**: Error due to excessive complexity (overfitting).\n  - **High variance**: Polynomial/nonlinear models (e.g., \\( \\hat{y} = w_1 x^2 + w_2 x + w_3 \\)).\n- **Tradeoff**:\n  - **Model 1 (Linear)** \u2192 Higher bias, lower variance.\n  - **Model 2 (Quadratic)** \u2192 Lower bias, higher variance.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Logistic Regression & Decision Boundaries**\n- **Sigmoid Function**:\n  \\[\n  \\sigma(z) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}, \\quad z = \\mathbf{w}^T \\mathbf{x} + b\n  \\]\n- **Decision Boundary**: Points where \\( \\sigma(z) = 0.5 \\) (i.e., \\( \\mathbf{w}^T \\mathbf{x} + b = 0 \\)).\n- **Angle \\( \\theta \\) of Weight Vector**:\n  - For points \\( \\mathbf{x}_1, \\mathbf{x}_2 \\) to be **class-1**, the weight vector \\( \\mathbf{w} \\) must satisfy:\n    \\[\n    \\mathbf{w}^T \\mathbf{x}_1 > 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\mathbf{w}^T \\mathbf{x}_2 > 0\n    \\]\n  - **Range for \\( \\theta \\)**: \\( 30^\\circ < \\theta < 150^\\circ \\) (derived from geometry of given points).\n\n---\n\n### **4.
