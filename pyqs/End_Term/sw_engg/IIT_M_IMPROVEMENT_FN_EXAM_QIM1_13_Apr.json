Core Topics & Concepts Summary**\n### **A. Software Development Methodologies**\n1. **Agile & Scrum**\n   - **Sprint Cycle**: Planning \u2192 Daily Scrum (Standup) \u2192 Review \u2192 Retrospective.\n   - **Three Key Questions in Daily Scrum**:\n     - What did I do yesterday?\n     - What will I do today?\n     - Are there any impediments?\n   - **Scrum Roles**: Product Owner, Scrum Master, Development Team.\n\n2. **Big Bang Approach**\n   - **Characteristic**: All modules integrated in **one single step** (no incremental integration).\n   - **Drawbacks**: Hard to localize errors, high risk.\n\n3. **Risk Management**\n   - **Project Risk**: Delays due to poor scheduling/mismanagement (mitigated via milestones & reviews).\n   - **Technical Risk**: System failures, performance issues.\n   - **Business Risk**: Market demand, competition.\n\n---\n\n### **B. Software Design Principles**\n1. **SOLID Principles**\n   - **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**:\n     - Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without altering correctness.\n     - **Example**: `Notification` (base) \u2192 `EmailNotification`, `SMSNotification` (subclasses).\n\n2. **Design Patterns**\n   - **Facade Pattern**:\n     - Provides a **unified interface** to a complex subsystem (e.g., e-commerce order processing).\n   - **Observer Pattern**: Notifies dependent objects of state changes (e.g., event handling).\n   - **Strategy Pattern**: Encapsulates interchangeable algorithms (e.g., payment methods).\n\n3. **Cohesion & Coupling**\n   - **Functional Cohesion** (Highest):\n     - All functions in a module contribute to **one single task** (e.g., `add_item()`, `delete_item()`, `view_inventory()`).\n   - **Common Coupling** (Problematic):\n     - Modules share a **global variable** (e.g., shared `stock_count`).\n\n---\n\n### **C. Software Testing**\n1. **Testing Types**\n   - **Stress Testing**: Pushes system **beyond expected capacity** to check failure handling.\n   - **Smoke Testing**: Basic checks to ensure the system **launches without crashing**.\n   - **Branch Coverage**: Tests all **possible branches** in code (e.g., `if-else` paths).\n     - **Test Cases for `age` validation**:\n       ```python\n       if age < 18 or age > 60: print(\"Not eligible\")\n       else: ...\n       ```\n       - **Valid Sets**: `{10, 25, 45}`, `{10, 25, 45, 65}`, `{10, 25, 60, 45, 18}`.\n   - **Multiple Condition Coverage**: Tests all **combinations of conditions** (e.g., `age < 18 OR age > 60`).\n\n2. **Debugging Strategies**\n   - **Backwards Debugging**: Start from the **error output** and trace backward to find the root cause.\n\n---\n\n### **D. Software Project Management**\n1. **Estimation Techniques**\n   - **Heuristic Estimation**: Uses **mathematical models/formulas** (e.g., COCOMO) instead of expert judgment.\n   - **Delphi Technique**: Anonymous expert consensus.\n   - **Empirical Estimation**: Based on historical data.\n\n2. **Project Management Tools**\n   - **JIRA/Pivotal Tracker**: Track **high-level progress + individual tasks**.\n   - **Slack**: Communication (not for task tracking).\n\n3. **Deployment Strategies**\n   - **Canary Deployment**: Roll out updates to a **small user subset** before full release.\n   - **Blue/Green Deployment**: Switch between two identical production environments.\n\n---\n\n### **E. Software Architecture & Design**\n1. **Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Architecture**\n   - **Characteristics**:\n     - No centralized server.\n     - Nodes share **resources (CPU, storage)**.\n     - Used in **distributed apps** (e.g., BitTorrent).\n\n2. **Class Relationships (UML)**\n   - **Inheritance**: `Electronics`, `Clothing`, `Books` \u2192 subclasses of `Product`.\n   - **Composition**: `ShoppingCart` **contains** `Product` (lifetime dependency).\n   - **Interface Implementation**: `Product` **implements** `Purchasable`.\n\n3. **Usability Heuristics (Nielsen\u2019s 10)**\n   - **Consistency**: UI elements should **behave predictably** (e.g., \"Add to Cart\" button placement).\n   - **Memorability**: Users should **remember how to use** the system after time away.\n\n---\n\n### **F. Development Environments & Tools**\n1. **IDE Features**\n   - **Python IDEs**: PyCharm, VSCode, Thonny (support **syntax checking, debugging**).\n   - **Not an IDE**: Notepad (no debugging/syntax help).\n\n2. **Cloud Models**\n   - **PaaS (Platform-as-a-Service)**:\n     - **Pros**: No infrastructure management, quick deployment.\n     - **Cons**: **Limited customization**, less control than IaaS.\n\n---\n\n### **G. Requirements Engineering**\n1. **SMART User Stories**\n   - **Specific**: Clear criteria (e.g., \"search by **name, category, price**\").\n   - **Measurable**: Quantifiable success (e.g., \"find products **quickly**\").\n\n2. **Requirements Gathering Techniques**\n   - **Documentation Review**: Analyzing official guidelines (e.g., banking regulations).\n   - **Interviews/Focus Groups**: Direct user feedback.\n\n---\n\n### **H. Performance Optimization**\n1. **Web Performance**\n   - **Minify/Compress Static Content**: Reduces **page load time** \u2192 higher sales.\n   - **Avoid**:\n     - Unnecessary JavaScript **before rendering**.\n     - Frequent **cache refreshes**.\n\n---\n\n## **2. Key Equations (Mathematics/Testing)**\n### **A. Equivalence Partitioning**\nFor `determineSign(int num)`:\n- **Positive**: \\( x > 0 \\)\n- **Negative**: \\( x < 0 \\)\n- **Zero**: \\( x = 0 \\)\n**Valid Partitions**: \\((-\\infty, -1), \\{0\\}, (1, \\infty)\\)\n\n### **B. Branch Coverage Test Cases**\nFor:\n```python\nif (A or B):\n    ...\nelse:\n    if (C and D):\n        ...\n```\n- **Minimum Test Cases**:\n  - `A=True, B=False` (covers `A`)\n  - `A=False, B=True` (covers `B`)\n  - `C=True, D=True` (covers `C and D`)\n  - `C=False` or `D=False` (covers `else`)\n\n---\n\n## **3.
