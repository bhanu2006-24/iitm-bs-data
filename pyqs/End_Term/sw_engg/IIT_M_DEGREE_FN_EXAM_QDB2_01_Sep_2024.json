        "summary": "Here\u2019s a structured summary of the **core topics, concepts, principles, and equations** essential for the **Software Engineering** exam, along with **Mermaid knowledge graphs** to visualize relationships.\n\n---\n\n## **1. Core Topics & Concepts**\n### **A. Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)**\n- **Phases**:\n  - Requirements Gathering\n  - **Design** (Modularity, Coupling, Cohesion)\n  - Development\n  - Testing (Unit, Integration, System)\n  - Deployment (Strategies: Blue/Green, Canary, Versioned)\n  - Maintenance\n- **Key Principle**:\n  - **High Cohesion, Low Coupling** (Good design principle).\n  - **Modularity** (Breaking software into independent modules).\n\n### **B. Agile & Project Management**\n- **Velocity**: Number of **story points completed per sprint** (Agile estimation).\n- **User Stories (SMART)**:\n  - **Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Timeboxed**.\n  - If a story is too large, **subdivide it** (Achievable).\n- **Project Management Tools**:\n  - Provide **big-picture & detailed progress tracking**.\n  - Help in **knowledge archiving** (but not primary purpose).\n\n### **C. Software Metrics**\n1. **Lines of Code (LOC) Metrics**:\n   - **Raw Metrics**: Counts **all lines (code, comments, whitespace)**.\n   - **Cyclomatic Complexity (V)**:\n     - Measures **control flow complexity**.\n     - Formula:\n       \\[\n       V = E - N + 2P\n       \\]\n       - \\(E\\) = Edges in control flow graph\n       - \\(N\\) = Nodes\n       - \\(P\\) = Connected components (usually 1)\n     - **For loops/if-statements**, \\(V = \\text{Number of decisions} + 1\\).\n     - Example: Nested loops + if \u2192 \\(V = 3\\) (Q18).\n\n2. **COCOMO Model (Cost Estimation)**:\n   - **Effort (Person-Months)**:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Effort} = a \\times (\\text{KLOC})^b\n     \\]\n     - \\(a, b\\) = Constants (varies by project type: Organic, Semi-Detached, Embedded).\n     - **Embedded Project**: \\(a = 3.6, b = 1.20\\).\n   - **Cost Calculation**:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Cost} = \\text{Effort} \\times \\text{Salary per Staff}\n     \\]\n     - Example (Q11): **300 KLOC \u2192 Effort \u2248 3696.56 PM \u2192 Cost \u2248 \u20b9184M**.\n\n### **D. Software Design & Architecture**\n1. **Design Patterns**:\n   - **Strategy Pattern**:\n     - **Runtime algorithm selection** (e.g., payment methods in e-commerce).\n     - Components:\n       - **Context** (e.g., `PaymentManager`).\n       - **Strategy Interface** (e.g., `Payable`).\n       - **Concrete Strategies** (e.g., `PayByCash`, `PayByCard`).\n   - **Pipe & Filter Architecture**:\n     - **Data processing through sequential filters** (e.g., image enhancement app).\n\n2. **UML Diagrams**:\n   - **Interaction View (Sequence Diagram)**: Models **message exchanges** between system parts.\n   - **Class Diagram Relationships**:\n     - **Association** (e.g., `B \u2192 A`).\n     - **Inheritance** (e.g., `D, E` inherit from `A`).\n     - **Composition** (Strong ownership, e.g., `A` composed of `D`).\n\n3. **Coupling & Cohesion**:\n   - **High Coupling**: Modules **heavily depend** on each other (bad).\n   - **Low Cohesion**: Module functions **do unrelated tasks** (bad).\n   - Example (Q17): **Large shared data between modules \u2192 High Coupling**.\n\n### **E. Testing Techniques**\n1. **Equivalence Partitioning**:\n   - Divide input into **valid/invalid classes**.\n   - Example (Q23): `findInterest(months)`:\n     - Invalid: `months \u2264 0`.\n     - Valid: `0 < months < 12`, `12 \u2264 months < 36`, `months \u2265 36`.\n\n2. **Branch Coverage**:\n   - Test **all branches** (if/else, loops).\n   - Example (Q25): `fact(n)` needs tests for:\n     - `n < 0`, `n = 0`, `n = 1`, `n > 1`.\n\n3. **Multiple Condition Coverage**:\n   - Test **all combinations of conditions** in decisions.\n   - Example (Q26): `n < 0`, `n == 0 || n == 1`.\n\n### **F. Prototyping & UI Design**\n- **Prototyping Techniques**:\n  - **Paper Prototype**: Hand-drawn UIs (low-fidelity).\n  - **Storyboards**: Sequence of UI screens (user flow).\n- **UI Heuristics**:\n  - **Recognition over Recall**: Minimize user memory load (e.g., **avoid ambiguous icons** like animal pictures for payroll buttons).\n\n### **G. Deployment & Cloud Services**\n1. **Deployment Strategies**:\n   - **Canary Deployment**: **Incremental rollout** to a small user subset.\n   - **Blue/Green**: Switch between identical production environments.\n2. **Cloud Models**:\n   - **PaaS (Platform-as-a-Service)**: Heroku, Google App Engine.\n   - **IaaS**: AWS EC2 (not in options).\n   - **SaaS**: Gmail, Slack.\n\n### **H. Risk Assessment**\n- **Assessed Risk = Probability \u00d7 Impact**.\n- Example (Q20): **Budget slippage (0.9)** is the highest probability risk.\n\n### **I. Debugging Strategies**\n- **Blackbox Debugging**: **No code access**, rely on **documentation/API specs** (e.g., payment gateway integration).\n\n### **J. Monitoring & Performance**\n- **Monitoring Tools Objectives**:\n  - **Analyze page resources** (performance score, SEO, accessibility).\n  - **Understand customer behavior** (not caching/compression).\n\n---\n\n## **2. Key Equations**\n| **Concept**               | **Equation**                                                                 |\n|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Cyclomatic Complexity** | \\( V = E - N + 2P \\)                                                        |\n| **COCOMO Effort**         | \\( \\text{Effort} = a \\times (\\text{KLOC})^b \\)                              |\n| **Project Cost**          | \\( \\text{Cost} = \\text{Effort} \\times \\text{Salary per Staff} \\)           |\n| **Velocity (Agile)**      | \\( \\text{Velocity} = \\frac{\\text{Story Points Completed}}{\\text{Sprint}} \\) |\n\n---\n\n## **3.

Exam Tips**\n1. **Focus on Equations**:\n   - **Cyclomatic Complexity**, **COCOMO**, **Effort/Cost Calculation**.\n2. **Diagrams**:\n   - **UML (Class/Sequence)**, **Deployment Strategies**.\n3. **Key Concepts**:\n   - **Coupling/Cohesion**, **Design Patterns (Strategy, Pipe-Filter)**, **Testing (Branch/Multiple Condition Coverage)**.\n4. **Avoid Confusion**:\n   - **Raw Metrics \u2260 Cyclomatic Complexity** (Raw counts all lines; Cyclomatic measures control flow).\n   - **Canary Deployment \u2260 Blue/Green** (Canary is incremental; Blue/Green is full switch).",
