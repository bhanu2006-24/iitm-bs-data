        "summary": "Here\u2019s a structured **summary of core topics, concepts, principles, and equations** for the **Software Engineering** exam, followed by **Mermaid knowledge graphs** to visualize relationships.\n\n---\n\n## **1. Core Topics & Concepts**\n### **A. Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)**\n- **Phases**:\n  - **Requirements Gathering** (Techniques: Questionnaires, Interviews, Focus Groups, **Naturalistic Observations**).\n  - **Design** (Mock-ups: **Software like Photoshop/PowerPoint**).\n  - **Development** (Coding).\n  - **Testing** (Ensuring code meets requirements; **Alpha Testing** = Internal team testing).\n  - **Deployment** (Strategies: **Versioned Deployment** = Multiple versions for user choice).\n  - **Maintenance**.\n- **Coupling Types** (Tightest \u2192 Loosest):\n  - **Content Coupling** (Module-X modifies internals of Module-Y).\n  - Control, Common, Data Coupling.\n\n### **B. UI/UX Heuristics**\n- **Freedom (Undo/Redo)**: Allows users to backtrack (e.g., \"Undo Send\" in emails).\n- **Recognition over Recall**: Minimize user memory load (e.g., dropdown menus).\n- **Familiar Language**: Use intuitive terms (e.g., \"Shopping Cart\" instead of \"Item Holder\").\n\n### **C. Testing**\n- **Black-Box Testing**:\n  - **Equivalence Partitioning**: Divide input data into valid/invalid classes.\n    - Example for `getDiscount(price)`:\n      - Valid: `price = 1800` (10% discount), `price = 3800` (20% discount).\n      - Invalid: `price = -10`, `price = 0`.\n  - **Branch Coverage**: Test all logical branches (e.g., leap year function).\n    - Test cases: `{2000, 2200, 1755}` (covers all `if/else` paths).\n- **Integration Testing**:\n  - **Top-Down**: Requires **stubs** (dummy modules).\n  - **Bottom-Up**: Requires **drivers** (test harnesses).\n  - **Big Bang**: All modules integrated at once.\n- **Alpha vs. Beta Testing**:\n  - **Alpha**: Internal team tests integrated system.\n  - **Beta**: External users test in real environments.\n\n### **D. Design Patterns**\n- **Builder Pattern**:\n  - Separates object construction from representation (e.g., `PackageMaker` builds `Package` step-by-step).\n- **SOLID Principles**:\n  - **Single Responsibility (SRP)**: A class should have one reason to change.\n    - Violation: Adding statistical methods to a `Calculator` class (should split into `Calculator` + `Statistics`).\n  - **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**: Open for extension, closed for modification.\n    - Correct Answer for Q20 is **B (Open-Closed Principle)** (not SRP, as the question describes adding new features without modifying existing code).\n\n### **E. Project Management**\n- **Risk Management**:\n  - **Project Risk**: Lack of domain knowledge (mitigation: **hire experts** or **outsource**).\n- **Scrum Roles**:\n  - **Product Owner**: Bridges clients and dev team (prioritizes backlog).\n  - **Scrum Master**: Ensures sprint activities run smoothly.\n- **COCOMO Model** (Effort Estimation):\n  - Formula: **Effort = a \u00d7 (Total LOC)^b**\n    - **Total LOC** = Sum of LOC for all modules (e.g., 120,000 LOC).\n    - Constants:\n      - **Organic (simple)**: a=2.4, b=1.05.\n      - **Semi-Detached (moderate)**: a=3.0, b=1.12 \u2192 **639.45 person-months** (correct answer).\n      - **Embedded (complex)**: a=3.6, b=1.20.\n\n### **F. Version Control (Git)**\n- **Workflow to Push Changes**:\n  1. `git add` (stage changes).\n  2. `git commit` (save locally).\n  3. `git push` (upload to remote).\n- **Git Commands**:\n  - `git clone`: Copy remote repo locally.\n  - `git pull`: Fetch + merge remote changes.\n\n### **G. Deployment & Hosting**\n- **Bare Metal Servers**: Physical hardware owned by the company (vs. cloud-based IaaS/PaaS).\n- **Minification**: Compresses code (e.g., JS/CSS) to **reduce load time** (not related to memory/database).\n\n### **H. Usability Goals**\n- **Safe to Use**: Features like \"trash recovery\" prevent data loss.\n- **Efficiency/Effectiveness/Learnability/Memorability**: Other goals (e.g., shortcuts for efficiency).\n\n### **I. Class Diagrams & Relationships**\n- **Association**: Weak relationship (e.g., `Playlist` **has** `Song`).\n- **Composition**: Strong ownership (e.g., `Song` **contains** `Classical/NonClassical`).\n- **Inheritance**: `Classical` **is-a** `Song`.\n\n### **J. Debugging Strategies**\n- **Blackbox Debugging**: Treat API as a \"black box\" (use docs/examples to infer behavior).\n\n---\n\n## **2. Key Equations**\n| **Concept**               | **Equation**                          | **Variables**                                                                 |\n|---------------------------|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **COCOMO Effort**         | Effort = a \u00d7 (Total LOC)^b            | a, b = constants; LOC = Lines of Code                                       |\n| **Discount Calculation**  | discount = price \u00d7 rate              | rate = 0.1 (price < 2000), 0.2 (price \u2265 2000)                             |\n| **Leap Year Logic**       | (year % 400 == 0) OR (year % 100 != 0 AND year % 4 == 0) | Boolean condition for leap year |\n\n---\n\n## **3.

Exam Tips**\n1. **Focus on Equations**:\n   - COCOMO effort calculation (Q13).\n   - Leap year logic (Q25).\n   - Discount function (Q15).\n2. **Diagrams**:\n   - Class relationships (Q18: Composition + Inheritance).\n   - Builder Pattern (Q14).\n3. **Testing**:\n   - Equivalence partitioning (Q15: `{0, 1800, 3800}`).\n   - Branch coverage (Q25: Test all `if/else` paths).\n4. **SDLC Phases**:\n   - Testing = Ensuring code meets requirements (Q2).\n   - Naturalistic observations = Watching real-world scenarios (Q3).\n5. **SOLID**:\n   - **Open/Closed Principle** (Q20) is about extending without modifying (not SRP).\n6. **Git**:\n   - Sequence: `add` \u2192 `commit` \u2192 `push` (Q16).\n7. **Risk Mitigation**:\n   - Lack of domain knowledge \u2192 Hire experts or outsource (Q24).",
