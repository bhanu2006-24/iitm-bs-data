        "summary": "Here\u2019s a structured **summary of core topics, concepts, principles, and equations** for the **Software Engineering (Computer-Based Exam)**, along with **Mermaid knowledge graphs** to visualize relationships.\n\n---\n\n## **Core Topics & Concepts Summary**\n### **1. Software Development Methodologies**\n- **Agile & Scrum**:\n  - **Sprint Cycle**: Planning \u2192 Daily Scrum (Standup) \u2192 Review \u2192 Retrospective.\n  - **Scrum Meeting (Daily Standup)**: Answers 3 questions:\n    1. What did I do yesterday?\n    2. What will I do today?\n    3. Any blockers?\n  - **Sprint Retrospective**: Reflect on improvements.\n- **Big Bang Approach**:\n  - All modules integrated in **one step** (no incremental integration).\n  - **Disadvantages**: Hard to localize errors, high risk.\n\n### **2. Project Management & Tools**\n- **Project Management Tools**:\n  - **JIRA, Pivotal Tracker**: Track tasks, sprints, and progress.\n- **Risk Management**:\n  - **Project Risk**: Delays due to poor scheduling (mitigated via milestones & reviews).\n  - **Technical Risk**: System failures, performance issues.\n  - **Business Risk**: Market demand, competition.\n\n### **3. Software Testing**\n- **Stress Testing**: Push system beyond expected capacity to check robustness.\n- **Smoke Testing**: Basic functionality check after a build.\n- **Branch Coverage**:\n  - Test all possible branches in code (e.g., `if-else` paths).\n  - Example (Python):\n    ```python\n    if age < 18 or age > 60:  # Branch 1\n        print(\"Not eligible\")\n    else:                      # Branch 2\n        if age >= 18 and age <= 30:  # Branch 2a\n            print(\"Young Adult\")\n        else:                   # Branch 2b\n            print(\"Adult\")\n    ```\n  - **Valid Test Cases**: Must cover all branches (e.g., `{10, 25, 45, 65}`).\n- **Multiple Condition Coverage**:\n  - Test all combinations of conditions (e.g., `age < 18 OR age > 60`).\n  - Requires **4 test cases** (TT, TF, FT, FF).\n\n### **4. Software Design Principles**\n- **SOLID Principles**:\n  - **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**:\n    - Subclasses must be substitutable for their base class.\n    - Example: `Notification` (base) \u2192 `EmailNotification`, `SMSNotification` (subclasses).\n- **Design Patterns**:\n  - **Facade Pattern**: Simplifies complex subsystems (e.g., e-commerce order processing).\n  - **Adapter Pattern**: Converts incompatible interfaces.\n  - **Observer Pattern**: Event-driven updates (e.g., notifications).\n- **Cohesion & Coupling**:\n  - **Functional Cohesion**: All functions in a module contribute to a single task (e.g., `add_item()`, `delete_item()` in `Inventory`).\n  - **Common Coupling**: Modules share a global variable (high risk, avoid).\n\n### **5. Debugging Strategies**\n- **Backwards Debugging**: Start from the error and trace backward to find the root cause.\n- **Forwards Debugging**: Step through code execution to find where it fails.\n\n### **6. Deployment Strategies**\n- **Canary Deployment**: Roll out updates to a small user group before full release.\n- **Blue/Green Deployment**: Switch between two identical production environments.\n\n### **7. Usability & UX Design**\n- **Heuristics (Nielsen\u2019s 10 Usability Heuristics)**:\n  - **Consistency**: UI elements should follow uniform patterns (e.g., \"Add to Cart\" button placement).\n  - **Memorability**: Users should easily recall how to use the system.\n  - **Learnability**: New users should quickly understand the interface.\n- **User Stories (SMART Criteria)**:\n  - **Specific**: Clearly define \"what\" and \"why\" (e.g., \"search by name, category, price\").\n\n### **8. System Architecture**\n- **Peer-to-Peer (P2P)**:\n  - No centralized control.\n  - Nodes share resources (e.g., file-sharing networks).\n- **Client-Server vs. P2P**:\n  - **Client-Server**: Centralized control (e.g., web apps).\n  - **P2P**: Decentralized (e.g., BitTorrent).\n\n### **9. Cloud Computing Models**\n- **PaaS (Platform-as-a-Service)**:\n  - **Pros**: No infrastructure management, quick deployment.\n  - **Cons**: Limited customization, less control over infrastructure.\n- **IaaS (Infrastructure-as-a-Service)**: More control but requires manual management.\n\n### **10. Equivalence Partitioning (Testing)**\n- Divide input data into **equivalence classes** to reduce test cases.\n- Example for `determineSign(int num)`:\n  - **Positive**: `num > 0`\n  - **Negative**: `num < 0`\n  - **Zero**: `num = 0`\n- **Valid Partitions**: `(\u2212\u221e to \u22121), {0}, (1 to \u221e)`.\n\n### **11. Development Environment**\n- **Characteristics**:\n  - Includes **IDE** (e.g., VSCode, PyCharm), debuggers, compilers.\n  - **Not** for live user interactions (unlike production).\n\n### **12. Class Relationships (OOP)**\n- **Inheritance**: `Electronics`, `Clothing`, `Books` \u2192 subclasses of `Product`.\n- **Composition**: `ShoppingCart` **has-a** `Product` (not inheritance).\n- **Interface Implementation**: `Product` **implements** `Purchasable`.\n\n### **13. Performance Optimization**\n- **Web Performance**:\n  - **Minify & compress** static content (CSS/JS) to reduce load time.\n  - Avoid **unnecessary JS blocking rendering**.\n  - Use **caching** to reduce server load.\n\n### **14. Requirements Gathering Techniques**\n- **Documentation Review**: Study existing guidelines (e.g., banking regulations).\n- **Interviews/Focus Groups**: Direct user feedback.\n- **Questionnaires**: Structured data collection.\n\n---\n\n## **Mermaid Knowledge Graphs**\n### **1.
