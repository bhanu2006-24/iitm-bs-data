Core Topics & Concepts**\n### **A. Software Requirements**\n- **Functional vs. Non-Functional Requirements**\n  - *Functional*: What the system should do (e.g., \"gather product info from websites\").\n  - *Non-Functional*: How the system should behave (e.g., \"complete within 10 sec\").\n  - **Example (Q2)**:\n    - Requirement 1 (gather info) \u2192 **Functional**.\n    - Requirement 2 (10-sec limit) \u2192 **Non-Functional**.\n\n- **User Experience (UX) Goals (Q14)**\n  - Motivating, satisfying, entertaining (not technical goals like \"durable\" or \"safe\").\n\n---\n\n### **B. Software Design Principles**\n#### **1. SOLID Principles (Q4)**\n| Principle               | Description                                                                 | Violation Example (Q4)                     |\n|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|\n| **Single Responsibility** | A class should have only one reason to change.                             | N/A                                        |\n| **Open/Closed (OCP)**     | **Open for extension, closed for modification.**                          | Modifying `Payment` class to add UPI.     |\n| **Liskov Substitution**   | Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.                       | N/A                                        |\n| **Interface Segregation** | Clients shouldn\u2019t depend on interfaces they don\u2019t use.                    | N/A                                        |\n| **Dependency Inversion**  | High-level modules shouldn\u2019t depend on low-level modules.                 | N/A                                        |\n\n#### **2. Cohesion & Coupling (Q3, Q16)**\n- **High Cohesion**: Functions in a module work together for a **single task**.\n- **Low Coupling**: Modules interact **minimally** (better maintainability).\n- **Example (Q3)**:\n  - Correct: *\"Functions perform a single operation with low interaction between modules.\"*\n\n#### **3. Design Patterns (Q7)**\n| Pattern          | Use Case                                                                   | Example (Q7)                              |\n|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| **Adapter**      | Converts incompatible interfaces.                                          | Data format converter for 3rd-party module. |\n| **Facade**       | Simplifies complex subsystem interactions.                                | N/A                                       |\n| **Builder**      | Constructs complex objects step-by-step.                                  | N/A                                       |\n| **Strategy**     | Encapsulates interchangeable algorithms.                                  | N/A                                       |\n\n---\n\n### **C. Debugging Techniques (Q5, Q6)**\n| Technique            | Description                                                                 | Example (Q5/Q6)                          |\n|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| **Print Debugging**   | Insert `print` statements to trace execution.                             | Q5: Print statements in 50 functions.   |\n| **Forward Debugging** | Follow data/control flow **forward** from trigger to error.                | Q6: Track incorrect state from event.   |\n| **Backward Debugging**| Work **backward** from error to find root cause.                           | N/A                                      |\n| **Breakpoint**       | Pause execution at specific lines.                                         | N/A                                      |\n\n---\n\n### **D. Testing Techniques**\n#### **1. Black-Box Testing (Q8, Q27, Q28)**\n- **Equivalence Partitioning (Q8)**:\n  - Divide input into classes where behavior is similar.\n  - Example (Q8): Test `price` in ranges:\n    - `\u2264 0` (invalid), `1\u20131999` (10% discount), `\u2265 2000` (20% discount).\n  - **Valid Test Cases**: `{0, 1800, 3800}` (Option C).\n\n- **Branch Coverage (Q27)**:\n  - Test all branches (e.g., `if`, `else`).\n  - Example (Q27): For `dayStatus(day)`:\n    - Test `day \u2264 0`, `day > 7` (invalid).\n    - Test `day < 6` (weekday), `day \u2265 6` (weekend).\n  - **Valid Sets**: `{0, 5, 7}` (Option C) or `{5, 6, 9}` (Option D).\n\n- **Multiple Condition Coverage (Q28)**:\n  - Test all combinations of conditions (e.g., `day \u2264 0 OR day > 7`).\n  - **Valid Set**: `{0, 8, 5, 7}` (Option A).\n\n#### **2. Integration Testing (Q23)**\n- **Approaches**:\n  - **Top-Down**: Requires **stubs** (mock lower modules).\n  - **Bottom-Up**: Requires **drivers** (mock higher modules).\n  - **Big Bang**: Integrate all components at once (no stubs/drivers).\n  - **Mixed**: May need **both stubs and drivers**.\n  - **Example (Q23)**: Bottom-up and mixed approaches need **drivers**.\n\n#### **3.
