Core Topics & Concepts**\n#### **A. Software Development Methodologies**\n1. **Agile & Scrum**\n   - **Sprint Cycle**: Planning \u2192 Daily Scrum (Standup) \u2192 Review \u2192 Retrospective.\n   - **Three Questions in Daily Scrum**:\n     - What did I do yesterday?\n     - What will I do today?\n     - Are there any impediments?\n   - **Scrum Roles**: Product Owner, Scrum Master, Development Team.\n\n2. **Big Bang Approach**\n   - **Characteristic**: All modules integrated in **one single step** (no incremental integration).\n   - **Drawbacks**: Hard to localize errors, high risk.\n\n3. **Estimation Techniques**\n   - **Heuristic Estimation**: Uses mathematical models/formulas (e.g., COCOMO) instead of human judgment.\n   - **Delphi Technique**: Expert consensus via iterative anonymous feedback.\n   - **Empirical Estimation**: Based on historical data.\n\n---\n\n#### **B. Software Testing**\n1. **Testing Types**\n   - **Stress Testing**: Push system beyond expected capacity to observe behavior under extreme load.\n   - **Smoke Testing**: Basic checks to ensure the system launches.\n   - **Branch Coverage**: Test cases must cover all possible branches (e.g., `if-else` paths).\n     - **Example**: For `if (age < 18 || age > 60)`, test `age=10`, `age=25`, `age=65`.\n   - **Multiple Condition Coverage**: All combinations of conditions in a decision must be tested.\n     - **Example**: For `if (age < 18 || age > 60)`, test:\n       - `age < 18` (True), `age > 60` (False)\n       - `age < 18` (False), `age > 60` (True)\n       - Both False.\n\n2. **Equivalence Partitioning**\n   - Divide input data into classes where all members are expected to behave similarly.\n   - **Example**: For `determineSign(int num)`, classes are:\n     - Negative: `(\u2212\u221e to \u22121)`\n     - Zero: `{0}`\n     - Positive: `(1 to \u221e)`\n\n---\n\n#### **C. Software Design Principles**\n1. **Design Patterns**\n   - **Facade Pattern**: Provides a unified interface to a complex subsystem (e.g., simplifying order processing in e-commerce).\n   - **Adapter Pattern**: Converts one interface to another.\n   - **Observer Pattern**: Notifies dependent objects of state changes.\n\n2. **SOLID Principles**\n   - **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**:\n     - Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without altering program correctness.\n     - **Example**: `EmailNotification` and `SMSNotification` should inherit from a `Notification` base class.\n\n3. **Cohesion & Coupling**\n   - **Functional Cohesion**: Module elements contribute to a **single task** (e.g., `add_item()`, `delete_item()` in an inventory system).\n   - **Common Coupling**: Modules share a **global variable** (e.g., `total_stock_count`).\n   - **Types of Coupling (High to Low)**:\n     - Content \u2192 Common \u2192 Control \u2192 Data (best).\n\n---\n\n#### **D. Deployment Strategies**\n1. **Canary Deployment**: Roll out updates to a **small subset of users** (e.g., by location/demographics) before full release.\n2. **Blue/Green Deployment**: Switch traffic between two identical environments (zero downtime).\n3. **Versioned Deployment**: Multiple versions run simultaneously (e.g., A/B testing).\n\n---\n\n#### **E. Project Management**\n1. **Tools**: JIRA, Pivotal Tracker (for tracking progress at macro/micro levels).\n2. **Risk Types**:\n   - **Project Risk**: Delays due to poor scheduling/mismanagement.\n   - **Technical Risk**: Technology failures.\n   - **Business Risk**: Market demand changes.\n\n---\n\n#### **F. Usability & UX Design**\n1. **Heuristics (Nielsen\u2019s 10 Usability Heuristics)**\n   - **Consistency**: UI elements should follow uniform patterns (e.g., \"Add to Cart\" button placement).\n   - **Memorability**: Users should remember how to use the system after time away.\n   - **Learnability**: Easy for new users to accomplish tasks.\n2. **Usability Factors**:\n   - **Effectiveness**: Can users complete tasks?\n   - **Safety**: Prevents catastrophic errors.\n\n---\n\n#### **G. System Architecture**\n1. **Peer-to-Peer (P2P)**\n   - **Characteristics**:\n     - No centralized control.\n     - Nodes share resources (storage, processing).\n     - Used in distributed apps (e.g., BitTorrent).\n2. **Cloud Models**\n   - **PaaS (Platform-as-a-Service)**:\n     - **Pros**: No infrastructure management.\n     - **Cons**: Limited customization, less control over infrastructure.\n\n---\n\n#### **H. Debugging Strategies**\n1. **Backwards Debugging**: Start from the incorrect output and trace backward to find the root cause.\n2. **Forwards Debugging**: Step through code from the start to observe state changes.\n\n---\n\n#### **I. Requirements Engineering**\n1. **SMART User Stories**:\n   - **Specific**: Clear and detailed (e.g., \"search by name, category, price range\").\n   - **Measurable**, **Achievable**, **Relevant**, **Timeboxed**.\n2. **Techniques for Gathering Requirements**:\n   - **Documentation Review**: Analyzing official guidelines (e.g., banking regulations).\n   - **Interviews/Focus Groups/Questionnaires**.\n\n---\n\n#### **J. Development Environments**\n1. **Characteristics**:\n   - Includes **IDEs** (VSCode, PyCharm), debuggers, and compilers.\n   - **Not** for live user interactions (unlike production).\n2. **Python IDEs**: VSCode, PyCharm, Thonny.\n\n---\n\n#### **K. Performance Optimization**\n1. **Web Performance**:\n   - **Minify/Compress** static content (CSS/JS) to reduce load time.\n   - Avoid **unnecessary JS blocking rendering**.\n   - Use **caching** to reduce server load.\n\n---\n\n---\n\n### **2. Key Equations (Mathematics/Testing)**\n#### **A. Equivalence Partitioning**\nFor a function `determineSign(int num)`, the equivalence classes are:\n- Negative: \\( x \\mid x < 0 \\)\n- Zero: \\( x \\mid x = 0 \\)\n- Positive: \\( x \\mid x > 0 \\)\n\n#### **B. Branch Coverage**\nFor the code:\n```python\nif age < 18 or age > 60:\n    print(\"Not eligible\")\nelse:\n    if age >= 18 and age <= 30:\n        print(\"Young Adult\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Adult\")\n```\n**Test Cases** must cover:\n1. `age < 18` (e.g., 10)\n2. `age >= 18 and age <= 30` (e.g., 25)\n3. `age > 30 and age <= 60` (e.g., 45)\n4. `age > 60` (e.g., 65)\n\n#### **C. Multiple Condition Coverage**\nFor `if (A || B)`, test:\n1. A=True, B=False\n2. A=False, B=True\n3. A=False, B=False\n*(A=True, B=True is often redundant.)*\n\n---\n\n---\n\n### **3.
