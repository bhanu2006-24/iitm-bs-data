Exam Tips**\n1. **Focus Areas**:\n   - **Scrum roles** (Q3), **prototype types** (Q12), **cohesion** (Q4).\n   - **Testing**: Equivalence partitioning (Q23), branch coverage (Q25).\n   - **COCOMO calculations** (Q11: check units!).\n   - **Class diagrams** (Q24: composition vs. association).\n   - **Deployment strategies** (Q10, Q22).\n\n2. **Common Pitfalls**:\n   - Misapplying **cyclomatic complexity** (count decision points + 1).\n   - Confusing **LLOC/SLOC/LOC** (Q6: match definitions carefully).\n   - **COCOMO staffing**: Verify calculations (Q11 answer should be **~79,670**, not 796,696).\n\n3. **Mermaid Syntax Notes**:\n   - Avoid LaTeX in graphs; use text labels.\n   - Keep graphs simple (max 5\u20137 nodes per graph).",
