Core Topics & Concepts**\n### **A. Software Design & Architecture**\n#### **1. Interface Definition**\n- **Purpose**: Describes **what a function/module does** (not *how*).\n- **Key Points**:\n  - Specifies **allowed requests** and **output format** (e.g., API contracts).\n  - **Implementation should not change** if the interface remains the same.\n  - **Does not expose implementation details** (e.g., internal logic).\n- **Example**: REST API specifications, function signatures in code.\n\n#### **2. Class Diagrams (UML)**\n- **Relationships**:\n  - **Association**: Two classes are related (e.g., `User` \u2192 `TaskList`).\n  - **Inheritance (Generalization)**: Subclass inherits from a superclass (e.g., `TimeBoundTask` \u2190 `Task`).\n  - **Composition**: Strong \"has-a\" relationship (e.g., `TaskList` **contains** `Task` objects; lifetime bound).\n  - **Aggregation**: Weak \"has-a\" relationship (lifetime not bound).\n- **Key Classes in Questions**:\n  - `User`, `TaskList`, `Task`, `TimeBoundTask`, `Payment`, `Order`, `Item`, `UPIPayment`, `CardPayment`.\n\n#### **3. Design Patterns**\n| **Pattern**       | **Purpose**                                                                 | **Example from Questions**                                                                 |\n|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Builder**       | Construct complex objects step-by-step.                                    | `CustomerCreator` builds `Customer` (Q20).                                                 |\n| **Adapter**       | Make incompatible interfaces work together.                               | `CustomConverter` adapts `HeightConverter`/`WeightConverter` for `BMI` (Q24).            |\n| **Factory**       | Create objects without specifying the exact class.                         | Not directly tested, but contrast with Builder.                                            |\n| **Facade**        | Provide a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.                     | Not explicitly tested, but contrast with Adapter.                                         |\n\n#### **4.

Both should depend on abstractions. | Not tested.                                                                                 |\n\n---\n\n### **B. Software Development Processes**\n#### **1. Agile vs. Waterfall**\n| **Aspect**       | **Agile**                                                                 | **Waterfall**                          |\n|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| **Flexibility**  | Iterative, adaptive.                                                     | Rigid, linear phases.                 |\n| **Feedback**     | Continuous (e.g., Scrum sprints).                                       | Late (after full development).         |\n| **Use Case**     | Dynamic requirements (e.g., startups).                                  | Stable requirements (e.g., banking).  |\n\n#### **2. Scrum Framework**\n- **Roles**: Product Owner, Scrum Master, Development Team.\n- **Events**: Sprint Planning, Daily Standup, Sprint Review, Retrospective.\n- **Artifacts**: Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog, Increment.\n\n#### **3. DevOps**\n- **Goal**: Improve collaboration between **development (Dev)** and **operations (Ops)**.\n- **Key Practices**:\n  - **Continuous Integration (CI)**: Frequent code integration + automated testing (e.g., Jenkins, Travis CI).\n  - **Continuous Deployment (CD)**: Automated release to production.\n  - **Staging Environment**: Mirrors production for final testing (Q22, Q26).\n\n---\n\n### **C. Testing Strategies**\n#### **1.
