        "summary": "Here\u2019s a structured summary of the **core topics, concepts, principles, and equations** essential for the **Software Engineering** exam, along with **Mermaid knowledge graphs** to visualize relationships.\n\n---\n\n---\n\n### **1. Core Topics & Concepts**\n#### **A. Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) & Agile**\n- **Phases of SDLC**:\n  - Requirement Gathering \u2192 Design \u2192 Development \u2192 Testing \u2192 **Maintenance** (Q24).\n  - **Maintenance Phase**: Post-deployment updates (e.g., adding new features).\n- **Agile Practices**:\n  - **Sprint Retrospective** (Q21): Evaluates team dynamics, processes, and tools from the last sprint.\n  - **User Stories**: Must be **Relevant** (Q23) to ensure business value.\n- **Prototyping**:\n  - **Paper Prototype** (Q22): Hand-drawn UIs (low-fidelity).\n  - Other types: Storyboards, digital mock-ups, interactive prototypes.\n\n#### **B. Software Design Principles**\n- **SOLID Principles**:\n  - **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)** (Q12): Classes should be **open for extension but closed for modification**.\n    - *Violation Example*: Modifying `Payment` class instead of extending it for online payments.\n  - Other SOLID principles (SRP, LSP, ISP, DIP) were not directly tested but are foundational.\n- **Design Patterns**:\n  - **Facade Pattern** (Q13): Simplifies complex subsystem interactions (e.g., `OrderProcessor` encapsulating `OrderValidator`, `TaxCalculator`, etc.).\n  - Other patterns (Factory, Builder, Adapter) were options but not correct answers.\n- **Coupling Types** (Q17):\n  - **Control Coupling**: Passing a flag (e.g., `Order` \u2192 `Delivery` for fragile items).\n  - Others: Data coupling (preferred), common coupling, content coupling (avoid).\n- **Cohesion & Good Design Characteristics** (Q16):\n  - **Correctness**: Implements all functionalities accurately.\n  - **Efficiency**: Manages resources (time, space, cost).\n  - **Maintainability**: Easy to change.\n  - **Understandability**: Easy to comprehend.\n\n#### **C. Testing & Code Quality**\n- **Testing Types**:\n  - **Performance Testing**: Includes **stress testing** (Q5).\n  - **Branch Coverage** (Q10): Test cases must cover all branches (e.g., `marks < 0`, `marks >= 40`).\n    - Valid test sets: `{-10, 65, 30}`, `{-10, 65, 30, 105}`, etc.\n  - **Multiple Condition Coverage** (Q11): Tests all combinations of conditions (e.g., `marks < 0 OR marks > 100`).\n    - Requires `{-10, 65, 30, 105}` to cover all paths.\n- **Code Metrics**:\n  - **Cyclomatic Complexity** (Q9, Q20): Measures decision paths in code.\n    - Formula: `V(G) = E - N + 2P` (edges - nodes + 2*components).\n    - For the `sort` function: `V(G) = 4` (2 loops + 1 if statement + 1).\n  - **Halstead\u2019s Metrics**: Not tested here but related to code complexity.\n- **Debugging Techniques** (Q15):\n  - **Logging**: Using `print` statements to trace execution.\n  - Others: Dump and diff, stepping in debugger, profiling.\n\n#### **D. Deployment & DevOps**\n- **Deployment Strategies**:\n  - **Canary Deployment** (Q3):\n    - Incrementally rolls out changes to a **small subset of users**.\n    - Drawback: Maintaining **multiple versions** temporarily.\n  - Others: Blue-green, A/B testing, feature flags.\n- **Hosting Models** (Q7):\n  - **IaaS (Infrastructure-as-a-Service)**: VMs with raw compute resources (e.g., 1-core, 4GB RAM).\n  - Others: PaaS (includes software layers), Bare Metal (physical servers), SaaS.\n- **Performance Optimization**:\n  - **Task Queue** (Q8): Offloads non-critical tasks (e.g., sending emails) to avoid blocking HTTP requests.\n  - Others: Caching, CDN, database indexing.\n\n#### **E. Tools & Environments**\n- **Issue Trackers** (Q2): JIRA, Pivotal Tracker.\n- **IDEs vs. Text Editors** (Q14):\n  - **Text Editors**: Notepad, Vim.\n  - **IDEs**: VSCode, PyCharm.\n  - **Version Control**: Git.\n  - **Web Frameworks**: Flask.\n- **Environments** (Q6):\n  - **Production/Live Environment**: Where users interact with the deployed system.\n  - Others: Development (local), Staging (testing), QA.\n\n#### **F. UI/UX & Usability**\n- **Usability Goals** (Q19):\n  - **Learnability**: How easily users can learn to use the system (violated if demo videos are required).\n  - Others: Effectiveness, efficiency, memorability, safety.\n- **UI Heuristics** (Q18):\n  - **Support Error Recovery**: Helps users correct mistakes (e.g., re-enter account number).\n  - Others: Prevent errors, show status, provide help.\n\n#### **G. Project Management & Risk**\n- **Risk Prioritization** (Q27):\n  - **Risk Exposure = Probability \u00d7 Impact**.\n  - Highest priority: **Schedule Slippage** (0.3 \u00d7 4 = 1.2).\n- **Effort Estimation (COCOMO)** (Q26):\n  - Formula: `Effort = a \u00d7 (KLOC)^b \u00d7 EAF`.\n    - `KLOC`: Kilos of Lines of Code (100 KLOC = 100,000 LOC).\n    - `EAF`: Effort Adjustment Factor (1.58).\n    - For **Embedded Project** (a=3.6, b=1.20):\n      `Effort = 3.6 \u00d7 (100)^1.20 \u00d7 1.58 \u2248 1,429 person-month`.\n\n#### **H. Team Roles**\n- **Marketing Team** (Q4): Conducts market research to identify customers.\n- Others: Sales (converts leads), Support (post-sales help), Engineers (build product).\n\n---\n\n### **2.
