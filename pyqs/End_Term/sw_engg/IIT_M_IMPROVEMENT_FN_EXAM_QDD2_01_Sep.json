        "summary": "Here\u2019s a structured **summary of core topics, concepts, principles, and equations** for the **Software Engineering** exam, followed by **Mermaid knowledge graphs** to visualize relationships.\n\n---\n\n## **1. Core Topics & Concepts**\n### **A. Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)**\n- **Phases**:\n  - Requirements Gathering (e.g., focus groups, interviews, questionnaires).\n  - **Design** (modularity, cohesion, coupling, architectural patterns).\n  - Development (coding, debugging strategies).\n  - Testing (test case design: equivalence partitioning, branch coverage, multiple condition coverage).\n  - Deployment (strategies: Blue/Green, Canary, Versioned).\n  - Maintenance.\n- **Key Principle**:\n  - **Cohesion** (high cohesion = functions in a module work toward a single objective).\n  - **Coupling** (low coupling = minimal dependencies between modules).\n\n### **B. Project Management & Agile**\n- **Agile Metrics**:\n  - **Velocity**: Number of story points completed per sprint (not user stories or time).\n  - **User Stories (SMART)**:\n    - **Achievable**: If a story is too large, break it into smaller sub-stories.\n- **Project Management Tools**:\n  - Provide a **big-picture + detailed view** of progress (e.g., Jira, Trello).\n- **Prototyping Techniques**:\n  - **Paper Prototype**: Hand-drawn UIs (low-fidelity).\n  - **Storyboards**: Sequence of sketches to visualize workflows.\n  - **Digital Mockups/Interactive Prototypes**: Higher fidelity.\n\n### **C. Software Metrics**\n- **Raw Metrics**: Lines of code (including comments, whitespace).\n- **Cyclomatic Complexity** (`V`):\n  - Measures code complexity via independent paths.\n  - Formula: `V = E - N + 2P` (edges - nodes + 2*components).\n  - **Rules of Thumb**:\n    - `V \u2264 10`: Manageable.\n    - `V > 20`: High risk (needs refactoring).\n  - **Example**: Nested `if`/loops increase `V`.\n- **COCOMO Model** (Cost Estimation):\n  - **Effort (Person-Months)** = `a \u00d7 (LOC)^b`.\n  - **Project Types**:\n    - Organic (`a=2.4`, `b=1.05`).\n    - Semi-Detached (`a=3.0`, `b=1.12`).\n    - Embedded (`a=3.6`, `b=1.20`).\n  - **Cost** = Effort \u00d7 Salary per Staff.\n\n### **D. Debugging Strategies**\n- **Blackbox Debugging**: Using documentation/API specs to verify correct usage (e.g., payment gateway APIs).\n- **Input Manipulation**: Testing with varied inputs to isolate bugs.\n- **Forward/Backward Debugging**: Tracing execution forward/backward.\n\n### **E. Deployment & Cloud Models**\n- **Environments**:\n  - **Production (Live)**: End-users interact here.\n  - **Staging**: Mirrors production for final testing.\n  - **Development**: Local IDEs/tools.\n- **Deployment Strategies**:\n  - **Canary**: Incremental rollout to a small user subset.\n  - **Blue/Green**: Zero-downtime switch between identical environments.\n- **Cloud Service Models**:\n  - **IaaS**: Infrastructure (e.g., AWS EC2).\n  - **PaaS**: Platform (e.g., Heroku, Google App Engine).\n  - **SaaS**: Software (e.g., Gmail, Slack).\n\n### **F. Software Design & Architecture**\n- **Architectural Patterns**:\n  - **Pipe-and-Filter**: Data processed sequentially through filters (e.g., image processing).\n  - **Client-Server**: Request-response model.\n  - **MVC**: Separates Model, View, Controller.\n  - **Peer-to-Peer**: Decentralized nodes.\n- **Design Patterns**:\n  - **Strategy Pattern**: Runtime algorithm selection (e.g., payment methods in e-commerce).\n  - **Adapter/Facade/Iterator**: Other behavioral/structural patterns.\n- **UML Diagrams**:\n  - **Interaction View**: Sequence of message exchanges (e.g., sequence diagrams).\n  - **Class Diagrams**: Show associations, inheritance, composition.\n\n### **G. Testing & Quality Assurance**\n- **Test Case Design**:\n  - **Equivalence Partitioning**: Divide input into valid/invalid classes.\n    - Example: For `findInterest(months)`, test `-4` (invalid), `4` (valid <12), `25` (valid 12\u201336), `48` (valid >36).\n  - **Branch Coverage**: Ensure all branches (e.g., `if`, `else`) are tested.\n    - Example: `fact(n)` needs tests for `n < 0`, `n == 0/1`, and `n > 1`.\n  - **Multiple Condition Coverage**: Test all combinations of conditions in compound statements.\n- **Cyclomatic Complexity in Testing**:\n  - **Independent Paths** = `V`. For `fact(n)`, `V=4` (paths: `n<0`, `n=0/1`, `n>1`, loop iterations).\n\n### **H. Risk Assessment**\n- **Risk Probability**: `Assessed Risk` = Likelihood \u00d7 Impact.\n  - Example: \"Personnel shortfall\" (Impact=1, Assessed Risk=0.6) is less critical than \"Budget slippage\" (Impact=3, Assessed Risk=0.9).\n\n### **I. UI/UX Heuristics**\n- **Nielsen\u2019s Heuristics**:\n  - **Recognition over Recall**: Minimize user memory load (e.g., avoid obscure icons like animals for payroll buttons).\n  - **Flexibility/Efficiency**: Accelerators for expert users.\n  - **Clean Design**: Avoid clutter.\n\n### **J. Version Control & Collaboration**\n- **Tools**: Git, SVN (not directly tested but implied in team workflows).\n\n---\n\n## **2.

Exam Tips**\n1. **Focus on Equations**:\n   - COCOMO, Cyclomatic Complexity, and Risk Assessment are **high-yield** for calculations.\n2. **Diagrams**:\n   - Know **UML diagrams** (class, sequence, interaction) and **architectural patterns**.\n3. **Agile/Scrum**:\n   - Velocity = story points/sprint (not time or user stories).\n4. **Testing**:\n   - **Equivalence Partitioning**: Cover all input classes (valid/invalid).\n   - **Branch Coverage**: Test every `if`/`else` path.\n5. **Design Principles**:\n   - High cohesion + low coupling = better maintainability.\n6. **Cloud**:\n   - PaaS (Heroku) vs. IaaS (AWS EC2) vs. SaaS (Gmail).",
