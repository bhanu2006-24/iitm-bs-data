        "summary": "Here\u2019s a structured summary of the **core topics, concepts, principles, and equations** essential for the **Software Engineering (Computer-Based Exam)**, along with **Mermaid knowledge graphs** to visualize relationships.\n\n---\n\n## **1. Core Topics & Concepts**\n### **A. Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)**\n- **Phases**:\n  - Requirements Gathering (e.g., Focus Groups, Questionnaires, Interviews)\n  - Design (Modularization, Coupling/Cohesion)\n  - Development (Coding, Debugging)\n  - Testing (Unit, Integration, System)\n  - Deployment (Strategies: Blue/Green, Canary, Versioned)\n  - Maintenance\n- **Key Concepts**:\n  - **Coupling & Cohesion**:\n    - **High Coupling**: Modules are highly dependent (e.g., sharing large data chunks).\n    - **Low Cohesion**: Functions in a module serve unrelated purposes.\n  - **Prototyping Techniques**:\n    - **Storyboards** (Hand-drawn UI flows)\n    - **Paper Prototype** (Low-fidelity mockups)\n    - **Digital Mockups** (High-fidelity designs)\n    - **Interactive Prototype** (Clickable prototypes)\n\n### **B. Agile & Project Management**\n- **Velocity**:\n  - **Definition**: Number of story points completed per sprint.\n  - **Formula**:\n    ```\n    Velocity = \u03a3 (Story Points Completed in a Sprint)\n    ```\n- **User Stories (SMART Criteria)**:\n  - **Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Timeboxed**\n  - **Achievable**: If a story is too large, break it into smaller sub-stories.\n- **Project Management Tools**:\n  - Benefits:\n    - Big-picture & detailed progress tracking.\n    - Knowledge archiving for future projects.\n\n### **C. Software Metrics**\n- **Cyclomatic Complexity (McCabe\u2019s Metric)**:\n  - **Definition**: Measures code complexity based on independent paths.\n  - **Formula**:\n    ```\n    V(G) = E - N + 2P\n    ```\n    - `E` = Edges (control flow paths)\n    - `N` = Nodes (statements)\n    - `P` = Connected components (usually 1)\n  - **Rules of Thumb**:\n    - `V \u2264 10` \u2192 Simple\n    - `10 < V \u2264 20` \u2192 Moderate\n    - `V > 20` \u2192 Complex (refactor needed)\n- **Raw Metrics**:\n  - **Lines of Code (LOC)**: Includes code, comments, and whitespace.\n- **Halstead\u2019s Metrics**:\n  - Measures program vocabulary (operators/operands).\n\n### **D. Debugging Strategies**\n- **Blackbox Debugging**:\n  - Debugging without internal code knowledge (e.g., checking API docs).\n- **Input Manipulation**:\n  - Testing with different inputs to isolate bugs.\n- **Forward/Backward Debugging**:\n  - **Forward**: Start from input, trace execution.\n  - **Backward**: Start from error, trace backward.\n\n### **E. Deployment Strategies**\n| Strategy          | Description                                                                 |\n|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Blue/Green**    | Two identical environments; switch traffic between them.                  |\n| **Canary**        | Roll out changes to a small user subset first.                             |\n| **Versioned**     | Multiple versions run simultaneously (e.g., API versioning).              |\n\n### **F. Software Architectures**\n- **Pipe & Filter**:\n  - Data processed sequentially through filters (e.g., image processing).\n- **Client-Server**:\n  - Central server handles requests from clients.\n- **Model-View-Controller (MVC)**:\n  - Separates data (Model), UI (View), and logic (Controller).\n- **Peer-to-Peer (P2P)**:\n  - Decentralized; nodes communicate directly.\n\n### **G. Design Patterns**\n- **Strategy Pattern**:\n  - **Purpose**: Encapsulate interchangeable algorithms (e.g., payment methods).\n  - **Components**:\n    - **Context** (uses strategy)\n    - **Strategy Interface** (common contract)\n    - **Concrete Strategies** (implementations)\n  - **Benefits**:\n    - Flexibility (add new strategies without modifying context).\n    - Open/Closed Principle compliance.\n\n### **H. Testing Techniques**\n- **Equivalence Class Partitioning**:\n  - Divide input into valid/invalid classes (e.g., `months \u2264 0`, `0 < months < 12`).\n- **Branch Coverage**:\n  - Test all possible branches (e.g., `if`, `else`, loops).\n- **Multiple Condition Coverage**:\n  - Test all combinations of conditions (e.g., `n < 0`, `n == 0 || n == 1`).\n\n### **I. Risk Assessment**\n- **Risk Probability**:\n  - `Assessed Risk = Probability \u00d7 Impact`\n  - **Example**:\n    | Risk                          | Impact | Probability | Assessed Risk |\n    |-------------------------------|--------|-------------|---------------|\n    | Personnel Shortfall           | 1      | 0.6         | **0.6**       |\n    | Budget Slippage               | 3      | 0.9         | 2.7           |\n\n### **J. Cloud Computing Models**\n| Model               | Description                                                                 | Examples                     |\n|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|\n| **IaaS**           | Infrastructure (VMs, storage) as a service.                              | AWS EC2, Azure VMs           |\n| **PaaS**           | Platform (runtime, OS) as a service.                                      | Heroku, Google App Engine    |\n| **SaaS**           | Software (applications) as a service.                                     | Gmail, Slack                 |\n| **Bare Metal**     | Physical servers without virtualization.                                  | IBM Cloud Bare Metal         |\n\n### **K. UX/UI Heuristics**\n- **Nielsen\u2019s 10 Heuristics**:\n  - **Recognition over Recall**: Minimize memory load (e.g., intuitive icons).\n  - **Flexibility & Efficiency**: Accelerators for expert users.\n  - **Aesthetic & Minimalist Design**: Avoid clutter.\n\n---\n\n## **2. Key Equations**\n### **A. COCOMO Model (Cost Estimation)**\n- **Formula**:\n  ```\n  Effort (E) = a \u00d7 (KLOC)^b  [Person-Months]\n  Cost = E \u00d7 Salary per staff\n  ```\n- **Constants**:\n  | Project Type   | a    | b    |\n  |----------------|------|------|\n  | Organic        | 2.4  | 1.05 |\n  | Semi-Detached  | 3.0  | 1.12 |\n  | Embedded       | 3.6  | 1.20 |\n\n- **Example (Embedded, 300 KLOC, Salary = \u20b950,000)**:\n  ```\n  E = 3.6 \u00d7 (300)^1.20 \u2248 3.6 \u00d7 400 \u2248 1440 Person-Months\n  Cost = 1440 \u00d7 \u20b950,000 \u2248 \u20b916,90,00,000\n  ```\n\n### **B. Cyclomatic Complexity**\n- **Example (Selection Sort)**:\n  ```python\n  def ssort(items, n):\n      for it in range(n):          # +1 (loop)\n          min_i = it\n          for i in range(it+1, n): # +1 (nested loop)\n              if items[i] < items[min_i]: # +1 (condition)\n                  min_i = i\n          (items[it], items[min_i]) = (items[min_i], items[it])\n  ```\n  - **Complexity**: `2 (loops) + 1 (if) + 1 = 4`\n\n---\n\n## **3.
