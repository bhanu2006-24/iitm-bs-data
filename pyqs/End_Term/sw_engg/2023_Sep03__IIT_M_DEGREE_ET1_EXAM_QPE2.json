The organization wants to estimate the time and effort it will take to complete the project. To achieve an accurate estimation, they assembled a group of experienced project managers and developers. Each individual is given a detailed project plan and a form to record their time estimates. These estimates are then collected, compiled, and averaged by a designated coordinator. The process is repeated multiple times to refine the time estimation.  What estimation technique is being utilized in this scenario?"

Core Topics & Concepts**\n### **A. Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)**\n- **Waterfall Model**: Sequential phases (requirements \u2192 design \u2192 implementation \u2192 testing \u2192 deployment).\n- **Agile/Iterative Models**: Incremental development, flexibility for changes.\n- **V-Shaped Model**: Emphasizes testing at each phase.\n\n### **B. Software Architecture & Design**\n- **Architectural Patterns**:\n  - **Pipe & Filter**: Modules connected via data streams (e.g., audio processing).\n  - **Client-Server**: Separation of client (UI) and server (backend).\n  - **MVC (Model-View-Controller)**: Separation of concerns.\n  - **Peer-to-Peer**: Decentralized communication.\n- **Design Principles**:\n  - **SOLID Principles**:\n    - **Single Responsibility (SRP)**: One class \u2192 one responsibility.\n    - **Open/Closed (OCP)**: Extend without modifying existing code.\n    - **Liskov Substitution (LSP)**: Subtypes must be substitutable.\n    - **Interface Segregation (ISP)**: Avoid fat interfaces.\n    - **Dependency Inversion (DIP)**: Depend on abstractions, not concretions.\n  - **Design Patterns**:\n    - **Iterator**: Traverse collections without exposing internals.\n    - **Facade**: Simplify complex subsystem interactions.\n    - **Adapter**: Bridge incompatible interfaces.\n    - **Observer**: Event-driven communication.\n\n### **C. Coupling & Cohesion**\n- **Coupling Types** (Module Interdependence):\n  - **Common Coupling**: Modules share global data.\n  - **Content Coupling**: One module modifies another\u2019s internals.\n  - **Control Coupling**: Modules pass control flags.\n  - **Data Coupling**: Modules share data via parameters.\n- **Cohesion Types** (Module Responsibility):\n  - **Functional**: Single, well-defined task.\n  - **Sequential**: Output of one step \u2192 input of next.\n  - **Communicational**: Operates on same data.\n\n### **D. Version Control & IDEs**\n- **Git**: Distributed version control (commit, branch, merge).\n- **IDEs (Integrated Development Environments)**: Boost productivity (debugging, code completion, refactoring).\n\n### **E. Deployment Strategies**\n- **Blue/Green Deployment**: Zero-downtime switch between environments.\n- **Canary Deployment**: Gradual rollout to a subset of users.\n- **Versioned Deployment**: Multiple versions coexist.\n\n### **F. Testing**\n- **Types of Testing**:\n  - **Functional**: Verifies features (e.g., registration).\n  - **Non-Functional**: Performance, usability, security.\n    - **Stress Testing**: System behavior under extreme load.\n    - **Smoke Testing**: Basic functionality check.\n- **Test Coverage**:\n  - **Branch Coverage**: All decision outcomes tested (e.g., `if-else`).\n  - **Multiple Condition Coverage**: All combinations of conditions tested.\n- **Integration Testing Approaches**:\n  - **Top-Down**: Requires stubs.\n  - **Bottom-Up**: Requires drivers.\n  - **Big Bang**: All components tested at once.\n  - **Mixed (Hybrid)**: Combines top-down and bottom-up.\n\n### **G. Requirements Engineering**\n- **Functional vs. Non-Functional Requirements**:\n  - **Functional**: What the system does (e.g., \"allow registration\").\n  - **Non-Functional**: How the system performs (e.g., \"support 100 requests/sec\").\n- **Requirement Gathering Techniques**:\n  - **Interviews**: Explore issues (1:1 discussions).\n  - **Focus Groups**: Collect multiple viewpoints.\n  - **Documentation Review**: Understand regulations/standards.\n  - **Naturalistic Observation**: Study real-world usage.\n\n### **H. Usability & UI Heuristics**\n- **Usability Goals (Nielsen\u2019s Heuristics)**:\n  - **Efficiency**: Quick access to frequent tasks.\n  - **Learnability**: Easy for new users.\n  - **Memorability**: Easy to remember.\n  - **Error Prevention**: Avoid user mistakes (e.g., input validation).\n  - **Error Recovery**: Help users recover from errors.\n- **UI Evaluation**:\n  - **Show Status**: Keep users informed (e.g., progress bars).\n  - **Prevent Errors**: Validate inputs (e.g., no negative values).\n\n### **I. Risk Management**\n- **Risk Assessment Formula**:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Risk} = \\text{Probability} \\times \\text{Impact}\n  \\]\n  - Given: Risk = 1.6, Impact = 2 \u2192 Probability = 0.8.\n\n### **J. Estimation Techniques**\n- **Delphi Technique**: Iterative expert consensus for time/effort estimation.\n- **COCOMO (Constructive Cost Model)**: Algorithm-based cost estimation.\n- **Expert Judgment**: Relies on experienced individuals.\n\n### **K. Hosting & Performance**\n- **Hosting Options**:\n  - **Bare Metal Servers**: Full hardware control.\n  - **IaaS (Infrastructure-as-a-Service)**: Virtualized hardware.\n  - **PaaS (Platform-as-a-Service)**: Pre-configured development environment.\n- **Performance Optimization**:\n  - **Caching**: Store frequently accessed data.\n  - **Compression (Gzip/Brotli)**: Reduce static file sizes.\n  - **Task Queues**: Offload heavy tasks (e.g., background jobs).\n\n### **L. Debugging Strategies**\n- **Blackbox Debugging**: Use documentation/API specs without seeing internal code.\n- **Backwards Debugging**: Trace execution backward from error.\n- **Forwards Debugging**: Step through code from start.\n\n### **M. UML & Class Diagrams**\n- **Relationships**:\n  - **Inheritance (Generalization)**: `Car` **is-a** `Vehicle`.\n  - **Composition**: `Car` **has-a** `Engine` (strong ownership).\n  - **Aggregation**: Weak \"has-a\" relationship.\n\n### **N. User Stories & Refinement**\n- **INVEST Criteria**:\n  - **Independent**, **Negotiable**, **Valuable**, **Estimable**, **Small**, **Testable**.\n- **Refinement**: Make stories **specific** (e.g., add \"using email/mobile\").\n\n---\n\n## **2.

Exam Tips**\n1. **Focus on Definitions**:\n   - Know the difference between **functional vs. non-functional requirements**.\n   - Understand **coupling types** (common, content, control, data).\n   - Memorize **SOLID principles** and **design patterns**.\n\n2. **Testing & Coverage**:\n   - **Branch coverage** requires testing all `if-else` outcomes.\n   - **Multiple condition coverage** tests all combinations (e.g., `age >= 18 AND age <= 60`).\n\n3. **Architecture Patterns**:\n   - **Pipe & Filter** = Data flows through modules (e.g., audio processing).\n   - **MVC** = Separates model, view, controller.\n\n4. **Deployment Strategies**:\n   - **Blue/Green** = Zero-downtime switch.\n   - **Canary** = Gradual rollout.\n\n5. **Risk & Estimation**:\n   - **Risk = Probability \u00d7 Impact**.\n   - **Delphi Technique** = Iterative expert consensus.\n\n6. **UML & Relationships**:\n   - **Inheritance** = \"is-a\" (e.g., `Car` \u2192 `Vehicle`).\n   - **Composition** = \"has-a\" (strong ownership, e.g., `Car` \u2192 `Engine`).\n\n7. **Version Control**:\n   - **Git** = Branching, merging, commits.\n\n8. **Usability Heuristics**:\n   - **Prevent Errors** (input validation).\n   - **Efficiency** (quick access to frequent tasks).",
