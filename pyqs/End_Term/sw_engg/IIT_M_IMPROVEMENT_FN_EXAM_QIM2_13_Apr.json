Software Development Methodologies & Agile Practices**\n#### **Core Concepts:**\n- **Agile Methodologies**:\n  - Iterative development, customer collaboration, and adaptability.\n  - **Scrum Framework**:\n    - **Sprint**: Time-boxed iteration (1-4 weeks).\n    - **Scrum Meetings (Daily Standups)**: 3 key questions:\n      1. What did I do yesterday?\n      2. What will I do today?\n      3. Are there any blockers?\n    - **Artifacts**: Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog, Increment.\n    - **Ceremonies**: Sprint Planning, Daily Scrum, Sprint Review, Sprint Retrospective.\n- **Big Bang Approach**:\n  - All modules integrated in **one step** (no incremental integration).\n  - **Pros**: Simple for small projects.\n  - **Cons**: High risk, errors hard to localize.\n- **Risk Types**:\n  - **Project Risk**: Delays due to poor scheduling/mismanagement (mitigated via milestones/reviews).\n  - **Technical Risk**: Technology failures or implementation issues.\n  - **Business Risk**: Market demand, competition, or financial viability.\n\n#### **Key Equations/Principles:**\n- **Heuristic Estimation** (for project time/cost):\n  - Uses **predefined formulas** (e.g., COCOMO) or **rules of thumb** (not human judgment).\n  - Example: `Effort = a*(Size)^b * EAF` (COCOMO model).\n\n---\n#### **Mermaid Graph: Agile & Methodologies**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Software Development Methodologies] --> B[Agile]\n    A --> C[Waterfall]\n    A --> D[Big Bang]\n    B --> E[Scrum]\n    E --> F[Sprint: 1-4 Weeks]\n    E --> G[Ceremonies]\n    G --> H[Daily Standup]\n    G --> I[Sprint Planning]\n    G --> J[Sprint Review]\n    G --> K[Retrospective]\n    E --> L[Artifacts]\n    L --> M[Product Backlog]\n    L --> N[Sprint Backlog]\n    D --> O[Single-Step Integration]\n    D --> P[High Risk]\n```\n\n---\n\n---\n\n### **2. Software Testing**\n#### **Core Concepts:**\n- **Testing Types**:\n  - **Stress Testing**: Push system beyond expected capacity (e.g., high data loads).\n  - **Smoke Testing**: Basic functionality check after a build.\n  - **Acceptance Testing**: Validates system against user requirements.\n  - **Beta Testing**: Real-world testing by end-users.\n- **Test Coverage Techniques**:\n  - **Branch Coverage**: Test all possible branches (e.g., `if-else` paths).\n    - Example: For `if (age < 18 || age > 60)`, test:\n      - `age = 10` (true branch).\n      - `age = 25` (false branch, enters `else`).\n      - `age = 65` (true branch).\n  - **Multiple Condition Coverage**: Test all combinations of conditions.\n    - Example: For `if (age < 18 || age > 60)`, test:\n      - `age = 10` (T || X).\n      - `age = 25` (F || F).\n      - `age = 65` (F || T).\n- **Equivalence Partitioning**:\n  - Divide input data into **equivalence classes** (valid/invalid).\n  - Example for `determineSign(int num)`:\n    - **Positive**: `x > 0`.\n    - **Negative**: `x < 0`.\n    - **Zero**: `x = 0`.\n\n#### **Key Equations/Principles:**\n- **Branch Coverage Formula**:\n  - `Coverage = (Tested Branches / Total Branches) * 100%`.\n- **Equivalence Class Partitioning**:\n  - Input space divided into **disjoint subsets** (e.g., `[\u2212\u221e,\u22121]`, `{0}`, `[1,\u221e]`).\n\n---\n#### **Mermaid Graph: Testing Techniques**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Software Testing] --> B[Testing Types]\n    A --> C[Coverage Techniques]\n    B --> D[Stress Testing]\n    B --> E[Smoke Testing]\n    B --> F[Acceptance Testing]\n    B --> G[Beta Testing]\n    C --> H[Branch Coverage]\n    C --> I[Multiple Condition Coverage]\n    C --> J[Equivalence Partitioning]\n    H --> K[Test All If-Else Paths]\n    I --> L[Test Condition Combinations]\n    J --> M[Divide Input Space]\n```\n\n---\n\n---\n\n### **3.
