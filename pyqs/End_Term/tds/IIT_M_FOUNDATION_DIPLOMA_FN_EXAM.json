This assistant is used by students to learn concepts in geospatial analysis, optimization, and data science. This bot will be highly helpful for students in solving the questions given in the context of \u201cEmergency Medical Supply Delivery in Storm-Critical Zones\u201d in this question paper. The goal of the assistant is to help students think critically and solve problems independently without receiving direct answers or step-by-step solutions. \nThe instructor defines the following constraints for the LLM assistant (EduBot): \n1. <b>Do not provide final answers</b> \u2014 If a student asks for the solution, the agent must not give the final answer. 2. <b>Do not provide step-by-step code</b> \u2014 The agent must avoid giving Python, SQL, or R code directly. 3. <b>Encourage critical thinking</b> \u2014 The agent should guide students using <b>reflective questions, </b><b>sanity checks, and logical reasoning.</b>\n4. <b>Use context-aware prompts</b> \u2014 The agent should recognize when a student might have made a conceptual mistake (like unit errors) and provide guidance. \nThe instructor asks you, as part of a course assignment, to <b>design the system prompt</b> that will be sent to OpenAI\u2019s API for creating this LLM-based agent. Your task is to answer the given sub-questions to ensure EduBot works as expected.",

Core Topics & Concepts Summary**\n### **A. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**\n#### **Key Tools/Methods:**\n1. **Excel Text-to-Columns**:\n   - **Delimited vs. Fixed-Width**: Splits text based on a delimiter (e.g., comma, space) or fixed width.\n   - **Behavior if no delimiter is specified**: Entire column remains unchanged (but in practice, Excel may split on spaces/tabs by default).\n   - **Example**: Extracting numeric parts from `OrderID123` \u2192 Use a custom delimiter or `LEFT/RIGHT/MID` functions.\n\n2. **Data Deduplication**:\n   - **Tools**: OpenRefine (for fuzzy matching, clustering), Excel (exact matching), Python (`pandas.drop_duplicates()`).\n   - **Handling Inconsistencies**: Case sensitivity, whitespace, typos (e.g., \"John Doe\" vs. \"JOHN DOE\").\n\n3. **Log File Analysis**:\n   - **Apache Log Format**:\n     ```\n     IP - - [Time] \"Method URL Protocol\" Status Size \"Referer\" \"User-Agent\" Vhost Server\n     ```\n   - **Key Fields for Filtering**:\n     - **Time**: Parse with `%d/%b/%Y:%H:%M:%S %z` (e.g., `30/Apr/2024:07:12:09 -0500`).\n     - **Method**: `GET`, `POST` (extract with `request.split(' ')[0]`).\n     - **URL**: Extract with `request.split(' ')[1]`.\n     - **Status**: `200\u2013299` = success.\n   - **Time Filtering**:\n     - **Saturday Check**: `timestamp.weekday() == 5` (Monday=0, Sunday=6).\n     - **Time Range**: `10 <= timestamp.hour < 21`.\n   - **URL Pattern Matching**: `url.startswith('/telugump3/')`.\n\n---\n\n### **B. Machine Learning & Model Evaluation**\n#### **Key Concepts:**\n1. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**:\n   - **Bias-Variance Tradeoff**:\n     - **Low K (e.g., K=2)**: High variance (overfitting), sensitive to noise.\n     - **High K (e.g., K=6)**: High bias (underfitting), smoother decision boundaries.\n   - **Cross-Validation**: Used to select optimal `K` (avoids overfitting to training data).\n\n2. **K-Means Clustering**:\n   - **Stability Issues**: Random initialization \u2192 different cluster assignments.\n   - **Solution**: Set `n_init` (number of times algorithm runs with different centroid seeds) to a higher value (e.g., `n_init=10`).\n\n3. **Linear Regression**:\n   - **P-Value Interpretation**:\n     - **P < 0.05**: Statistically significant relationship (reject null hypothesis).\n     - **Example**: P=0.03 for \"number of bedrooms\" \u2192 significant impact on house prices.\n\n---\n\n### **C. Time Series Modeling (ARIMA)**\n#### **Key Equation**:\n```\nARIMA(p, d, q)\n```\n- **p**: Autoregressive lags (e.g., `p=5` \u2192 uses past 5 values).\n- **d**: Differencing order (e.g., `d=1` \u2192 first-order differencing for stationarity).\n- **q**: Moving average window.\n- **Example**: `ARIMA(order=(5,1,0))` \u2192 5 AR lags, 1st-order differencing, no MA.\n\n---\n\n### **D. Geospatial Analysis**\n#### **Key Concepts/Equations**:\n1. **Haversine Formula**:\n   - **Purpose**: Calculate great-circle distance between two points on a sphere (Earth).\n   - **Steps**:\n     1. Convert degrees to radians:\n        \\[\n        \\text{radians} = \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{180}\\right) \\times \\text{degrees}\n        \\]\n     2. Compute differences in latitude (\\(\\Delta \\varphi\\)) and longitude (\\(\\Delta \\lambda\\)).\n     3. Apply formula:\n        \\[\n        a = \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\Delta \\varphi}{2}\\right) + \\cos(\\varphi_1) \\cos(\\varphi_2) \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\Delta \\lambda}{2}\\right)\n        \\]\n        \\[\n        d = 2r \\cdot \\arcsin(\\sqrt{a})\n        \\]\n        where \\(r = 6371\\) km (Earth\u2019s radius).\n   - **Approximation**: For small angles, \\(\\sin(\\theta) \\approx \\theta\\).\n\n2. **Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP)**:\n   - **Goal**: Find shortest route visiting all locations once.\n   - **Tools**: Python libraries (`NetworkX`, `OR-Tools`, `SciPy`).\n\n---\n\n### **E. Web Development & Debugging**\n#### **Key Tools**:\n1. **Chrome DevTools**:\n   - **Cookies**: `Application` tab.\n   - **API Calls**: `Network` tab (filter by `XHR`).\n2. **Streamlit**:\n   - **Display Text**: `st.text(\"Hello\")` (not `st.add_text()` or `st.display_text()`).\n\n---\n\n### **F. Data Visualization & Dashboards**\n#### **Key Tools**:\n1. **Tableau**:\n   - **File Types**:\n     - `.twb`: Workbook (no data).\n     - `.twbx`: Packaged workbook (includes data).\n2. **Geospatial Libraries**:\n   - **Geopandas**: For geospatial data manipulation.\n   - **Folium**: For interactive maps.\n\n---\n\n### **G. Large Language Models (LLMs)**\n#### **Key Concepts**:\n1. **Prompt Engineering**:\n   - **Specificity**: \"List 3 key trends in AI\u2019s impact on employment with examples\" > \"Write about AI and jobs.\"\n   - **Cost**: Longer outputs \u2192 higher token usage \u2192 higher cost.\n2. **Validation**:\n   - **Cross-Check**: Use academic sources (not just other LLMs).\n3. **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**:\n   - **Workflow**:\n     1. Vectorize course material (FAISS/Weaviate).\n     2. Retrieve relevant chunks via semantic search.\n     3. Augment LLM prompt with retrieved context.\n4. **System Prompt Design**:\n   - **Constraints**:\n     - Avoid direct answers/code.\n     - Encourage critical thinking (e.g., \"How would you derive this formula?\").\n\n---\n\n---\n\n## **2.

Exam Tips**\n1. **Excel**:\n   - \"Text to Columns\" with no delimiter \u2192 **column remains unchanged** (but may split on spaces).\n   - Use `LEFT/RIGHT/MID` for string extraction if delimiters are inconsistent.\n\n2. **KNN/K-Means**:\n   - **KNN**: Smaller `K` \u2192 overfitting; larger `K` \u2192 underfitting.\n   - **K-Means**: Set `n_init` higher (e.g., 10) for stability.\n\n3. **ARIMA**:\n   - `order=(p,d,q)` \u2192 **not** `trend=(p,d,q)`.\n\n4. **Geospatial**:\n   - **Haversine**: Always convert degrees \u2192 radians first.\n   - **TSP**: Use `OR-Tools`/`NetworkX` for optimization.\n\n5. **LLMs**:\n   - **Prompt Design**: Avoid direct answers; use Socratic questioning.\n   - **RAG**: Retrieval \u2192 Augment \u2192 Generate.\n\n6. **Logs**:\n   - **Time Parsing**: `%d/%b/%Y:%H:%M:%S %z` (e.g., `30/Apr/2024:07:12:09 -0500`).\n   - **Saturday Check**: `timestamp.weekday() == 5`.\n\n7. **Tableau**:\n   - Share **`.twbx`** (packaged workbook with data).",
