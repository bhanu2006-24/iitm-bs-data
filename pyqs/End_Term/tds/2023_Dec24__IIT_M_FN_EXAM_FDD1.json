        "summary": "Here\u2019s a structured **summary of core topics, concepts, and principles** essential for the **\"Tools in Data Science\"** exam, along with a **Mermaid knowledge graph** to visualize relationships.\n\n---\n\n### **Core Topics & Key Concepts**\n#### **1. Data Science Tools & Libraries**\n- **OpenRefine**: Data cleaning/transformation (e.g., handling messy datasets).\n- **Pandas**: Data manipulation (e.g., `data_df['column'].unique()` to find unique values).\n- **Geospatial Libraries**:\n  - **Geopandas**: Extends Pandas for geospatial data.\n  - **Folium**: Interactive maps (built on Leaflet.js).\n- **Nominatim**: OpenStreetMap\u2019s geocoding tool (converts lat/long to place types).\n\n#### **2. Machine Learning & Statistics**\n- **K-Means Clustering**:\n  - Sensitive to initial centroids \u2192 Mitigate with `n_init` (runs algorithm multiple times).\n  - Key parameters: `n_clusters`, `max_iter`, `algorithm`.\n- **Regression Analysis**:\n  - **p-value < 0.05**: Statistically significant relationship between variables.\n- **ARIMA Models**:\n  - Syntax: `ARIMA(order=(p,d,q))` where:\n    - `p`: Autoregression lag (e.g., 4).\n    - `d`: Differencing order (e.g., 1).\n    - `q`: Moving average (e.g., 0).\n  - Example: `ARIMA(order=(4,1,0))` for autoregression with lag 4 and differencing order 1.\n- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**:\n  - **Cross-validation**: Finds optimal `K` (e.g., `K=6`).\n  - **Low `K` (e.g., 2)**: Higher variance, risk of overfitting.\n  - **High `K`**: Higher bias, risk of underfitting.\n\n#### **3. Data Visualization & BI Tools**\n- **Tableau**:\n  - **Workbook**: File containing sheets, dashboards, and stories.\n- **Pivot Tables (Excel)**:\n  - Change calculations via **\"Summarize Values by\"** in Value Field Settings.\n- **Trend Lines/Slopes**:\n  - Visualize in **line charts** or calculate using Excel\u2019s `SLOPE()` function.\n\n#### **4. Web Development & DevTools**\n- **Chrome DevTools**:\n  - Access: Right-click \u2192 **Inspect** or `Ctrl+Shift+I`.\n  - **Network Tab**: Monitors API calls.\n  - **Application Tab**: Stores cookies, local storage.\n- **Streamlit**:\n  - `st.text()`: Display text.\n  - `st.button()`: Add interactive buttons.\n\n#### **5. Text & Network Analysis**\n- **Subjectivity Score**: Ranges from **0 to 1** (not -1 to +1).\n- **Kumu Networks**:\n  - Requires columns: `from`, `to` for edge connections.\n\n#### **6. Excel Functions**\n- **Text to Columns**:\n  - **Delimited**: Splits text based on specified delimiters (default: no split if none selected).\n- **WEEKNUM**:\n  - `=WEEKNUM(date, [return_type])`:\n    - `return_type=1`: Week starts on Sunday.\n    - `return_type=7`: Week starts on Monday (default).\n\n---\n\n### **Key Equations (Mathematics/Statistics)**\n1. **ARIMA Model**:\n   \\[\n   y_t = c + \\sum_{i=1}^p \\phi_i y_{t-i} + \\sum_{j=1}^q \\theta_j \\epsilon_{t-j} + \\epsilon_t\n   \\]\n   - \\(p\\): AR lag order, \\(d\\): Differencing, \\(q\\): MA order.\n\n2. **Linear Regression Slope (Excel)**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{SLOPE}(y, x) = \\frac{n(\\sum xy) - (\\sum x)(\\sum y)}{n(\\sum x^2) - (\\sum x)^2}\n   \\]\n\n3. **KNN Distance Metric (Euclidean)**:\n   \\[\n   d(\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{y}) = \\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - y_i)^2}\n   \\]\n\n---\n\n### **Mermaid Knowledge Graph**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    %% Data Science Tools\n    A[Data Science Tools] --> B[OpenRefine: Clean/Transform]\n    A --> C[Pandas: data_df['column'].unique()]\n    A --> D[Geospatial]\n    D --> D1[Geopandas]\n    D --> D2[Folium]\n    D --> D3[Nominatim: Lat/Long \u2192 Place Type]\n\n    %% Machine Learning\n    A --> E[Machine Learning]\n    E --> F[K-Means]\n    F --> F1[n_init: Mitigate Centroid Sensitivity]\n    F --> F2[Parameters: n_clusters, max_iter]\n    E --> G[Regression]\n    G --> G1[p-value < 0.05: Significant]\n    E --> H[ARIMA]\n    H --> H1[order=(p,d,q)]\n    E --> I[KNN]\n    I --> I1[Cross-Validation: Optimal K]\n    I --> I2[Low K: High Variance/Overfit]\n\n    %% Visualization & BI\n    A --> J[Visualization]\n    J --> J1[Tableau Workbook]\n    J --> J2[Pivot Tables: Summarize Values By]\n    J --> J3[Trend Line/SLOPE Function]\n\n    %% Web Dev & DevTools\n    A --> K[Web DevTools]\n    K --> K1[Chrome DevTools]\n    K1 --> K1a[Inspect: Right-Click]\n    K1 --> K1b[Network Tab: API Calls]\n    K1 --> K1c[Application Tab: Cookies]\n    K --> K2[Streamlit]\n    K2 --> K2a[st.text(), st.button()]\n\n    %% Text/Network Analysis\n    A --> L[Text/Network]\n    L --> L1[Subjectivity: 0 to 1]\n    L --> L2[Kumu: 'from', 'to' Columns]\n\n    %% Excel\n    A --> M[Excel]\n    M --> M1[Text to Columns: Delimited]\n    M --> M2[WEEKNUM: return_type=1 \u2192 Sunday]\n```\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    %% Focus: Machine Learning Workflow\n    ML[Machine Learning] --> A[K-Means]\n    A --> A1[Sensitive to Centroids]\n    A1 --> A2[Mitigate with n_init]\n    ML --> B[Regression]\n    B --> B1[p-value Interpretation]\n    ML --> C[ARIMA]\n    C --> C1[order=(p,d,q)]\n    ML --> D[KNN]\n    D --> D1[Cross-Validation for K]\n    D1 --> D2[K=2: Overfit]\n    D1 --> D3[K=6: Optimal]\n```\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    %% Focus: Data Cleaning & Transformation\n    Tools[Data Tools] --> A[OpenRefine]\n    A --> A1[Clean/Transform Data]\n    Tools --> B[Pandas]\n    B --> B1[Unique Values: df['col'].unique()]\n    Tools --> C[Excel]\n    C --> C1[Text to Columns]\n    C --> C2[WEEKNUM: return_type]\n    Tools --> D[Geospatial]\n    D --> D1[Geopandas/Folium]\n    D --> D2[Nominatim: Reverse Geocoding]\n```\n\n---\n### **Exam Tips**\n1. **Prioritize Equations**: Focus on ARIMA parameters, regression slope, and KNN distance metrics.\n2. **DevTools**: Know tabs (**Network** for APIs, **Application** for cookies).\n3. **Streamlit/Tableau**: Syntax (`st.text()`) and terminology (**Workbook**).\n4. **Excel**: `WEEKNUM` return types and **Pivot Table** calculations.\n5. **False Positives**:\n   - Subjectivity score is **0 to 1** (not -1 to +1).\n   - K-Means uses `n_init`, not `algorithm` for centroid stability.",
