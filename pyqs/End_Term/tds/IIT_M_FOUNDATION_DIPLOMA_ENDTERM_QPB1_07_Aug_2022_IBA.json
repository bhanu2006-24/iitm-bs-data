        "summary": "Here\u2019s a structured **summary of core topics, concepts, and equations** for the **\"Diploma Level: Tools in Data Science\"** exam, along with **Mermaid knowledge graphs** to visualize relationships.\n\n---\n\n---\n\n### **Core Topics & Concepts Summary**\n#### **1. Data Visualization & BI Tools**\n- **Power BI**:\n  - Visualization of geographic/demographic data (e.g., GDP by country).\n  - **Limitation**: No native summary generation (Question 2).\n  - Extensions like **Quill** (for NLP-based summaries) are not directly supported in Power BI.\n- **Tableau**:\n  - Requires **latitude/longitude** for map visualizations (Question 15).\n  - **Logical calculations** use `IF-ELSEIF-ELSE` syntax (but Tableau uses `ELSEIF` instead of `ELSE IF`; Question 16).\n- **Google Data Studio**:\n  - Used for **dashboard creation** (small/large projects; Question 39).\n- **Kumu**:\n  - Visualizes **complex network data** (e.g., social networks; Question 13).\n\n#### **2. Geospatial Data & GIS Tools**\n- **QGIS**:\n  - Creates **shapefiles** and identifies regions with high/low indicators (e.g., health metrics; Question 3).\n- **Geocoding with Nominatim** (Python):\n  - Extracts **latitude/longitude** for locations (e.g., \"IIT Madras\"; Question 19).\n  - Can retrieve **location types** (tourist, historic; Question 20).\n  - Code snippet:\n    ```python\n    from geopy.geocoders import Nominatim\n    locator = Nominatim(user_agent=\"myGeocoder\")\n    location = locator.geocode(\"IIT Madras, Chennai, India\")\n    print(f\"Latitude = {location.latitude}, Longitude = {location.longitude}\")\n    ```\n- **Distance Calculation**:\n  - Use `geopy.distance.distance()` for coordinates (Question 5).\n    ```python\n    distances_km.append(geopy.distance.distance(location1, location2).km)\n    ```\n\n#### **3. Web Scraping**\n- **Tools**:\n  - **Developer Tools** (browser): Inspect website structure before scraping (Question 17).\n  - **Requests**: Fetch HTML content (Question 18).\n  - **BeautifulSoup**: Parse HTML (e.g., extract weather data; Question 6).\n    - Example: Scrape high/low temperatures using class names:\n      ```python\n      daily_high_values = soup.find_all('span', attrs={'class': 'wr-day-temperature__high-value'})\n      ```\n- **APIs**:\n  - **BBC Weather API**: Returns data in **JSON** format (Question 42).\n  - **Inspect API calls** in browser under the **Network tab** (Question 40).\n  - **Urllib**: Construct API URLs (Question 41).\n\n#### **4. Data Preprocessing & Exploration**\n- **Pandas-Profiling**:\n  - Generates **exploratory reports** (including outliers; Question 8).\n- **Excel**:\n  - **Text-to-Columns**: Supports delimiters like comma, tab, semicolon (but **not tilde `~`**; Question 21).\n  - **Correlation Analysis**:\n    - Use `CORREL()` for pairwise correlations or **Data Analysis Toolpak** for regression (Questions 7, 46).\n    - Visualize relationships with **scatter plots**.\n  - **Outlier Detection**: Use **Box and Whisker charts** (Question 43).\n- **One-Hot Encoding**:\n  - Convert categorical variables (e.g., `AA`, `BB`, `CC`) to binary columns (Questions 25, 26).\n  - Python: `pandas.get_dummies(df['column'])`.\n\n#### **5. Machine Learning & Modeling**\n- **Scikit-Learn**:\n  - **Decision Trees**:\n    - Handle **class imbalance** with `class_weight` (Question 29).\n  - **K-Means**:\n    - Reduce impact of initial centroids with `n_init` (Question 27).\n  - **Metrics**:\n    - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** for regression (Question 30):\n      ```python\n      from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error\n      ```\n    - **Classification Report**: Displays precision, recall, F1-score (Question 37).\n  - **ARIMA**:\n    - Syntax: `ARIMA(order=(p,d,q))` where:\n      - `p` = lag for autoregression (e.g., 4),\n      - `d` = differencing order (e.g., 1),\n      - `q` = moving average (e.g., 0; Question 31).\n- **PyCaret**:\n  - **Low-code ML library** for automated model training (Question 32).\n- **Kerras Loss Functions**:\n  - **Categorical Cross-Entropy** for multi-class classification (e.g., fruit groups; Question 36).\n\n#### **6. Text & Sentiment Analysis**\n- **TextBlob**:\n  - Returns **polarity** (sentiment strength, range `[-1, 1]`) and **subjectivity** (opinion vs. fact, range `[0, 1]`; Questions 33\u201335).\n    - Example: `polarity = -0.5` \u2192 negative sentiment.\n- **Azure ML Excel Add-in**:\n  - **Inputs/Outputs** for sentiment analysis:\n    - Input: Text column (e.g., `Sheet1!A1:A11`).\n    - Output: Sentiment scores (e.g., `Sheet1!C1`; Question 44).\n\n#### **7. Sparse Data & Graphs**\n- **SciPy**:\n  - **`csr_matrix`**: Efficient storage for **sparse matrices** (many zeros; Questions 11, 38).\n- **Scikit-Network**:\n  - Analyzes **large graphs** (e.g., social networks; Questions 12, 45).\n\n#### **8. Data Anonymization**\n- **Tools**:\n  - **Anonimatron**, **ARX**, **Amnesia**, **sdcMicro** (Question 23).\n  - **Static anonymization**: Sufficient for one-time use (Question 24).\n- **Excluded Tools**: Power BI (not for anonymization).\n\n#### **9. Automation & Workflow**\n- **Apache Airflow**: Not directly relevant to this exam (appears in Question 17 as a distractor).\n\n#### **10. Miscellaneous**\n- **ComicGen**:\n  - Creates **data comics** but **cannot integrate with Excel/Google Sheets** (Question 10).\n- **Autocorrelation Plots**:\n  - Y-axis = **correlation** (Question 22).\n\n---\n\n---\n\n### **Mermaid Knowledge Graphs**\n#### **1.
