Data Visualization & BI Tools**\n- **Power BI**:\n  - Visualization of geographic/demographic data (e.g., GDP vs. location).\n  - **Limitation**: No native summary generation (Q2).\n  - Extensions like **Quill** (for narrative summaries) are not directly integrated (Q2).\n- **Tableau**:\n  - Map visualization requires **latitude/longitude** (not just country names) (Q13).\n  - Logical calculations (e.g., `IF [Profit] > 0 THEN 'Profitable'`) must use `ELSEIF` (not `ELSE IF`) (Q14).\n- **Excel**:\n  - **Correlation analysis**: Use `CORREL()` for pairwise variables or **Data Analysis Toolpak** for matrices (Q6, Q23).\n  - **Regression**: `SLOPE()` for preliminary analysis (Q22); **Data Analysis Toolpak** for full regression (Q23).\n  - **Outlier detection**: **Box-and-Whisker plots** (Q42).\n  - **Text-to-Columns**: Supports delimiters like comma, tab, semicolon, but **not tilde (~)** (Q18).\n\n#### **2. Geospatial Data & GIS Tools**\n- **QGIS**:\n  - Create/analyze **shapefiles** (e.g., districts with health indicators) (Q3).\n  - Filter high-value regions using attributes.\n- **Geopy**:\n  - Calculate distances between coordinates (lat/long) using:\n    ```python\n    geopy.distance.distance(location1, location2).km  # Correct syntax (Q5)\n    ```\n- **Nominatim (Geopy)**:\n  - Retrieve **latitude/longitude** for locations (e.g., \"IIT Madras\") (Q17, Q45):\n    ```python\n    locator = Nominatim(user_agent=\"myGeocoder\")\n    location = locator.geocode(\"IIT Madras, Chennai, India\")\n    print(location.latitude, location.longitude)\n    ```\n  - Classify location types (e.g., tourist, historic) (Q17).\n\n#### **3. Web Scraping & APIs**\n- **Tools**:\n  - **Developer Tools (Browser)**: Inspect website structure before scraping (Q15).\n  - **BeautifulSoup**: Parse HTML/XML (e.g., extract weather data) (Q16, Q43, Q44).\n  - **Requests**: Fetch webpage HTML (Q16, Q40).\n    ```python\n    import requests\n    response = requests.get(\"https://example.com\")\n    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')\n    ```\n- **APIs**:\n  - **BBC Weather API**: Returns data in **JSON** format (Q41).\n  - **Urllib**: Construct API URLs (Q40).\n  - **Inspect Element \u2192 Network Tab**: Monitor API calls (Q39).\n\n#### **4. Data Preprocessing & Exploration**\n- **Pandas**:\n  - **Exploratory Analysis**: `pandas-profiling` generates reports with **outlier detection** (Q7).\n  - **One-Hot Encoding**: Convert categorical variables (e.g., `AA, BB, CC`) using:\n    ```python\n    pd.get_dummies(df['column'])  # Q24, Q25\n    ```\n  - **Value Counts**: Count categories (e.g., salary ranges):\n    ```python\n    df['salary_range'].value_counts()  # Q27\n    ```\n- **Excel**:\n  - **Delimiters**: Comma, tab, semicolon (but **not tilde**) for text-to-columns (Q18).\n\n#### **5. Machine Learning & Modeling**\n- **Scikit-Learn**:\n  - **Decision Trees**: Handle class imbalance with `class_weight` (Q28).\n  - **K-Means**: Reduce initialization bias with `n_init` (Q26).\n  - **Metrics**:\n    - **MAE**: `mean_absolute_error(y_true, y_pred)` (Q29).\n    - **Classification Report**: Precision, recall, F1-score (Q36).\n- **ARIMA (Statsmodels)**:\n  - Syntax: `ARIMA(order=(p,d,q))` where:\n    - `p` = autoregression lag (e.g., 4),\n    - `d` = differencing order (e.g., 1),\n    - `q` = moving average (e.g., 0) (Q30).\n- **Keras**:\n  - **Multi-class classification**: Use `categorical_crossentropy` loss (Q35).\n- **PyCaret**: Low-code ML library for quick prototyping (Q31).\n\n#### **6. Text & Sentiment Analysis**\n- **TextBlob**:\n  - Returns **polarity** (sentiment: `-1` to `1`) and **subjectivity** (opinion vs. fact: `0` to `1`) (Q32, Q33, Q34).\n  - Example:\n    ```python\n    from textblob import TextBlob\n    analysis = TextBlob(\"I love this!\")\n    print(analysis.sentiment.polarity)  # 0.5 (positive)\n    print(analysis.sentiment.subjectivity)  # 0.6 (opinionated)\n    ```\n- **Azure ML Excel Add-in**:\n  - Input: Text data (e.g., reviews in column `A`).\n  - Output: Sentiment scores (e.g., column `C`) (Q46).\n\n#### **7. Network & Graph Analysis**\n- **Scikit-Network**:\n  - Analyze **large graphs** (e.g., social networks) (Q10, Q47).\n- **Kumu**:\n  - Visualize **complex network data** (Q11).\n- **SciPy**:\n  - **CSR Matrix**: Efficient storage for **sparse matrices** (many zeros) (Q9, Q37).\n\n#### **8. Data Anonymization**\n- **Tools**:\n  - **Anonimatron**, **ARX**, **Amnesia**, **sdcMicro** (Q20).\n  - **Static anonymization**: Sufficient for one-time use (Q21).\n- **Non-Tools**: Power BI (cannot anonymize) (Q20).\n\n#### **9. Miscellaneous Tools**\n- **Comicgen**:\n  - Create data comics with custom characters/emotions (but **cannot** auto-generate comics from text) (Q8).\n- **Google Data Studio**:\n  - Build **dashboards** (not for network visualization or photo editing) (Q38).\n- **Wikipedia API**:\n  - **`wikipedia` library** in Python (not BeautifulSoup) (Q12).\n\n---\n\n### **Key Equations & Code Snippets**\n| **Topic**               | **Equation/Code**                                                                 |\n|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Distance (Geopy)        | `geopy.distance.distance(loc1, loc2).km`                                         |\n| ARIMA Order             | `ARIMA(order=(p, d, q))`                                                         |\n| One-Hot Encoding        | `pd.get_dummies(df['column'])`                                                   |\n| Sentiment Analysis      | `TextBlob(text).sentiment.polarity` (range: `-1` to `1`)                          |\n| MAE                     | `mean_absolute_error(y_true, y_pred)`                                            |\n| K-Means Initialization  | `KMeans(n_init=10)` (default)                                                     |\n| Correlation (Excel)     | `=CORREL(array1, array2)`                                                        |\n| Regression (Excel)      | `=SLOPE(y_range, x_range)`                                                       |\n| Latitude/Longitude      | `Nominatim().geocode(\"address\").latitude`                                         |\n| Sparse Matrix           | `scipy.sparse.csr_matrix(data)`                                                  |\n\n---\n\n### **Mermaid Knowledge Graphs**\n#### **1.
