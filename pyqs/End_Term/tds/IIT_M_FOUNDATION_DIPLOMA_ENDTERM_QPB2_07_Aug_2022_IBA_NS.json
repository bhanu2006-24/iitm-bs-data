        "summary": "Here\u2019s a structured **summary of core topics, concepts, and tools** covered in the exam, along with **key equations** (where applicable) and **Mermaid knowledge graphs** to visualize relationships.\n\n---\n\n---\n\n### **Core Topics & Concepts Summary**\n#### **1. Data Visualization & BI Tools**\n- **Power BI**:\n  - Visualization of geographic/demographic data (e.g., GDP by country).\n  - **Limitation**: No native summary generation (Question 2).\n  - Extensions like **Quill** (for NLP-based summaries) are not directly integrated.\n- **Tableau**:\n  - Requires **latitude/longitude** for map visualizations (Question 15).\n  - **Logical calculations** (e.g., `IF [Profit] > 0 THEN 'Profitable' ELSEIF ...`) are valid in Tableau (Question 16).\n- **Google Data Studio**:\n  - Used for **dashboard creation** (small/large projects) (Question 39).\n- **Kumu**:\n  - Specialized for **complex network data visualization** (Question 13).\n\n#### **2. Geospatial Data & Tools**\n- **QGIS**:\n  - Create/modify **shapefiles** and analyze spatial data (e.g., health indicators by district) (Question 3).\n- **Geopy/Nominatim**:\n  - Compute **distances between coordinates** (Haversine formula via `geopy.distance.distance().km`) (Question 5).\n  - Retrieve **latitude/longitude** and **location types** (e.g., tourist/historic) (Questions 19\u201320).\n  - Code snippet for geocoding:\n    ```python\n    from geopy.geocoders import Nominatim\n    locator = Nominatim(user_agent=\"myGeocoder\")\n    location = locator.geocode(\"IIT Madras, Chennai, India\")\n    print(f\"Latitude = {location.latitude}, Longitude = {location.longitude}\")\n    ```\n- **Excel**:\n  - **Text-to-Columns**: Supports delimiters like comma, tab, semicolon, but **not tilde (~)** (Question 21).\n\n#### **3. Web Scraping & APIs**\n- **BeautifulSoup + Requests**:\n  - Extract HTML content (e.g., weather data, airline tables) (Questions 6, 9, 17\u201318).\n  - **Developer Tools** (Browser Inspect) to analyze website structure before scraping (Question 17).\n  - **API Inspection**: Use the **Network tab** in browser DevTools to identify API calls (Question 40).\n- **Wikipedia Scraping**:\n  - **`wikipedia` library** for direct extraction (Question 14).\n  - **`urllib`** to construct API URLs (Question 41).\n- **BBC Weather API**:\n  - Outputs data in **JSON format** (Question 42).\n\n#### **4. Data Preprocessing & Exploration**\n- **Pandas-Profiling**:\n  - Generates **exploratory data analysis (EDA) reports**, including outliers (Question 8).\n- **One-Hot Encoding**:\n  - Convert categorical variables (e.g., `AA`, `BB`, `CC`) to binary columns using `pandas.get_dummies()` (Questions 25\u201326).\n- **Anonymization Tools**:\n  - **Anonimatron**, **ARX**, **Amnesia**, **sdcMicro** (but **not Power BI**) (Questions 23\u201324).\n  - **Static anonymization** is sufficient for one-time use (Question 24).\n- **Outlier Detection**:\n  - **Box-and-Whisker plots** in Excel (Question 43).\n\n#### **5. Machine Learning & Statistics**\n- **Correlation Analysis**:\n  - Excel\u2019s `CORREL()` function works for **pairwise variables** (Question 7).\n  - **Autocorrelation plots**: Y-axis represents **correlation** (Question 22).\n- **Scikit-Learn**:\n  - **Decision Trees**: Use `class_weight` to handle **imbalanced classes** (Question 29).\n  - **K-Means**: `n_init` reduces sensitivity to initial centroids (Question 27).\n  - **Metrics**:\n    - `mean_absolute_error` for \\(\\frac{1}{n}\\sum|y_i - \\hat{y}_i|\\) (Question 30).\n    - `classification_report` for precision/recall/F1-score (Question 37).\n- **ARIMA Models**:\n  - Syntax: `ARIMA(order=(p,d,q))` where:\n    - `p` = autoregressive lag (e.g., 4),\n    - `d` = differencing order (e.g., 1),\n    - `q` = moving average (e.g., 0) (Question 31).\n- **Sentiment Analysis**:\n  - **TextBlob** returns `polarity` (-1 to 1) and `subjectivity` (0 to 1) (Questions 33\u201335).\n    - **Polarity = -0.5**: Negative sentiment.\n    - **Subjectivity = 0.8**: Opinionated (not factual).\n- **Keras Loss Functions**:\n  - **`categorical_crossentropy`** for multi-class classification (e.g., fruit types) (Question 36).\n\n#### **6. Sparse Data & Graphs**\n- **SciPy**:\n  - **`csr_matrix`**: Efficient storage for **sparse matrices** (many zeros) (Questions 11, 38).\n- **Scikit-Network**:\n  - **Social network analysis** and **large graph analysis** (Questions 12, 38).\n\n#### **7. Low-Code ML & Automation**\n- **PyCaret**: Low-code ML library (Question 32).\n- **Azure ML Excel Plugin**:\n  - Outputs: **Sentiment** and **Score** (Question 4).\n  - Input/Output for sentiment analysis: **Review text \u2192 Sentiment label** (Question 44).\n- **ComicGen**:\n  - Creates **comic characters/emotions** for data storytelling (but **cannot** auto-generate comics from text) (Question 10).\n\n#### **8. Data Storytelling & Dashboards**\n- **ComicGen**: Integrates with **Google Sheets/Excel** (Question 10).\n- **Tableau/Power BI**: Require **proper data types** (e.g., geographic roles for maps) (Question 15).\n\n---\n\n### **Key Equations**\n1. **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{MAE} = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n} |y_i - \\hat{y}_i|\n   \\]\n   - Implemented via `sklearn.metrics.mean_absolute_error` (Question 30).\n\n2. **Autocorrelation**:\n   - Y-axis: **Correlation coefficient** (Question 22).\n\n3. **ARIMA Order**:\n   - `ARIMA(p, d, q)` where:\n     - `p` = AR lag,\n     - `d` = differencing,\n     - `q` = MA lag (Question 31).\n\n4. **Haversine Distance** (Geopy):\n   ```python\n   geopy.distance.distance(loc1, loc2).km\n   ```\n\n---\n\n### **Mermaid Knowledge Graphs**\n#### **1.
