This assistant is used by students to learn concepts in geospatial analysis, optimization, and data science. This bot will be highly helpful for students in solving the questions given in the context of \u201cEmergency Medical Supply Delivery in Storm-Critical Zones\u201d in this question paper. The goal of the assistant is to help students think critically and solve problems independently without receiving direct answers or step-by-step solutions. \nThe instructor defines the following constraints for the LLM assistant (EduBot): \n1. <b>Do not provide final answers</b> \u2014 If a student asks for the solution, the agent must not give the final answer. 2. <b>Do not provide step-by-step code</b> \u2014 The agent must avoid giving Python, SQL, or R code directly. 3. <b>Encourage critical thinking</b> \u2014 The agent should guide students using <b>reflective questions, </b><b>sanity checks, and logical reasoning.</b>\n4. <b>Use context-aware prompts</b> \u2014 The agent should recognize when a student might have made a conceptual mistake (like unit errors) and provide guidance. \nThe instructor asks you, as part of a course assignment, to <b>design the system prompt</b> that will be sent to OpenAI\u2019s API for creating this LLM-based agent. Your task is to answer the given sub-questions to ensure EduBot works as expected.",

        "summary": "Here\u2019s a structured summary of the core topics, concepts, principles, and equations from the question paper, along with Mermaid knowledge graphs to visualize relationships.\n\n---\n\n### **Core Topics and Concepts Summary**\n\n#### **1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**\n   - **Excel Operations**:\n     - `Text to Columns` tool: Splits text based on delimiters. If no delimiter is specified, the entire text remains unchanged.\n     - Example: Extracting numeric parts from strings like `OrderID123` requires specifying a delimiter (e.g., \"OrderID\").\n   - **Data Deduplication**:\n     - Tools: **OpenRefine** (for cleaning inconsistent data like `'John Doe'` vs. `'JOHN DOE'`).\n     - Excel/Pandas: `df['column'].unique()` or `df['column'].tolist()` to extract unique values.\n\n#### **2. Machine Learning Concepts**\n   - **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**:\n     - **Bias-Variance Tradeoff**:\n       - Low `K` (e.g., `K=2`): High variance (overfitting). High training accuracy but poor test accuracy.\n       - High `K` (e.g., `K=6`): Higher bias but better generalization.\n     - Equation: Distance metric (Euclidean, Manhattan) for neighbor selection.\n   - **K-Means Clustering**:\n     - **Stability**: Use `n_init` parameter to run the algorithm multiple times and avoid random initialization bias.\n     - Equation: Minimize within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS):\n       \\[\n       \\text{WCSS} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\min_{\\mu_j \\in C} \\|x_i - \\mu_j\\|^2\n       \\]\n   - **ARIMA Model**:\n     - **Parameters**: `(p, d, q)` where:\n       - `p`: Autoregressive lags (e.g., `5` in `ARIMA(5,1,0)`).\n       - `d`: Differencing order (e.g., `1` for stationarity).\n       - `q`: Moving average window (`0` means no moving average).\n     - Equation: Combined AR and MA terms:\n       \\[\n       y_t = c + \\sum_{i=1}^{p} \\phi_i y_{t-i} + \\sum_{j=1}^{q} \\theta_j \\epsilon_{t-j} + \\epsilon_t\n       \\]\n\n#### **3. Web Development and Debugging**\n   - **Chrome DevTools**:\n     - **Cookies**: Inspect under the **Application** tab.\n     - **API Calls**: Monitor under the **Network** tab (e.g., button-click triggers).\n   - **Streamlit**:\n     - Display text: `st.text(\"Your message\")`.\n\n#### **4. Geospatial Analysis**\n   - **Haversine Formula**:\n     - Calculates great-circle distance between two points on a sphere (e.g., Earth).\n     - Steps:\n       1. Convert latitudes/longitudes from degrees to radians:\n          \\[\n          \\text{radians} = \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{180}\\right) \\times \\text{degrees}\n          \\]\n       2. Compute differences: \\(\\Delta \\varphi = \\varphi_2 - \\varphi_1\\), \\(\\Delta \\lambda = \\lambda_2 - \\lambda_1\\).\n       3. Apply the formula:\n          \\[\n          d = 2r \\cdot \\arcsin\\left(\\sqrt{\\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\Delta \\varphi}{2}\\right) + \\cos(\\varphi_1) \\cos(\\varphi_2) \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\Delta \\lambda}{2}\\right)}\\right)\n          \\]\n          where \\(r = 6371\\) km (Earth\u2019s radius).\n     - Use Case: Emergency response route optimization.\n   - **Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP)**:\n     - **Tools**: Python libraries like `NetworkX`, `SciPy`, or `OR-Tools` for optimal route planning.\n     - Equation: Minimize total distance:\n       \\[\n       \\min \\sum_{i,j} d_{ij} x_{ij}\n       \\]\n       where \\(d_{ij}\\) is the distance between nodes \\(i\\) and \\(j\\), and \\(x_{ij}\\) is a binary decision variable.\n\n#### **5. Log Analysis**\n   - **Apache Log Format**:\n     - Fields: IP, timestamp, HTTP method, URL, status code, etc.\n     - Example entry:\n       ```\n       40.77.167.48 - - [30/Apr/2024:07:12:09 -0500] \"GET /mplayer2.jsz HTTP/1.1\" 200 7416\n       ```\n   - **Filtering**:\n     - **Time Parsing**: Use `%d/%b/%Y:%H:%M:%S %z` in Python\u2019s `datetime.strptime`.\n     - **Conditions**:\n       - Saturday check: `timestamp.weekday() == 5` (Monday=0, Sunday=6).\n       - Time range: `10 <= timestamp.hour < 21`.\n       - URL filter: `url.startswith('/telugump3/')`.\n       - Success status: `200 <= status < 300`.\n   - **Counting**:\n     - Python: `sum(1 for entry in filtered_entries if conditions)`.\n\n#### **6. LLM and Prompt Engineering**\n   - **System Prompt Design**:\n     - **Goals**:\n       - Avoid direct answers or code.\n       - Encourage critical thinking (e.g., \"How would you derive this?\").\n       - Use context-aware guidance (e.g., sanity checks for unit conversions).\n     - **Example**:\n       ```\n       \"You are a learning assistant. Do not provide final answers or code. Guide students with reflective questions and logical reasoning.\"\n       ```\n   - **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**:\n     - Workflow:\n       1. Vectorize course material (e.g., PDFs) and store in a vector database (FAISS/Weaviate).\n       2. Retrieve relevant chunks based on semantic similarity to the student\u2019s query.\n       3. Augment LLM prompt with retrieved context for personalized responses.\n\n---\n\n### **Key Equations**\n| **Topic**               | **Equation**                                                                                                                                 |\n|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **KNN Distance**        | Euclidean: \\(d(\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{y}) = \\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - y_i)^2}\\)                                                              |\n| **K-Means Objective**   | \\(\\text{WCSS} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\min_{\\mu_j \\in C} \\|x_i - \\mu_j\\|^2\\)                                                                       |\n| **ARIMA**               | \\(y_t = c + \\sum_{i=1}^{p} \\phi_i y_{t-i} + \\sum_{j=1}^{q} \\theta_j \\epsilon_{t-j} + \\epsilon_t\\)                                          |\n| **Haversine Distance**  | \\(d = 2r \\cdot \\arcsin\\left(\\sqrt{\\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\Delta \\varphi}{2}\\right) + \\cos(\\varphi_1) \\cos(\\varphi_2) \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\Delta \\lambda}{2}\\right)}\\right)\\) |\n| **TSP Objective**       | \\(\\min \\sum_{i,j} d_{ij} x_{ij}\\)                                                                                                           |\n\n---\n\n### **Mermaid Knowledge Graphs**\n\n#### **1.
