        "summary": "Here\u2019s a structured **summary of core topics, concepts, principles, and equations** for the **\"Tools in Data Science\"** exam, followed by **Mermaid knowledge graphs** to visualize relationships.\n\n---\n\n---\n\n### **Core Topics & Concepts Summary**\n#### **1. Data Visualization & BI Tools**\n- **Power BI**:\n  - Visualization of geographic/demographic data (e.g., GDP by country).\n  - **Limitation**: No native summary generation (Question 2).\n  - Extensions like **Quill** (for narratives) are not directly integrated (Question 2).\n- **Tableau**:\n  - **Map visualization** requires **geographic roles** (latitude/longitude or recognized place names).\n    - Fix for non-activated maps: Ensure column types are compatible (e.g., `String` for \"Country\" may not suffice; needs geographic metadata) (Question 12).\n  - **File structure**:\n    - **Worksheet**: Single view + shelves/legends.\n    - **Dashboard**: Collection of views from multiple worksheets.\n    - **Story**: Sequence of worksheets/dashboards (Question 46).\n  - **Joins**: Inner join (default) matches rows in both tables (Question 47).\n- **Google Data Studio**: Dashboard creation for small-scale projects (Question 33).\n- **Kumu**: Complex network data visualization (Question 10).\n\n#### **2. Geospatial Data Tools**\n- **QGIS**:\n  - Create/edit **shapefiles** (e.g., districts with health indicators).\n  - Supports **spatial analysis** (e.g., identifying high-indicator districts) (Question 3).\n- **Nominatim API** (Python `geopy`):\n  - Reverse geocoding: Get place type (e.g., tourist/historic) from latitude/longitude (Questions 15, 43, 56).\n  - Distance calculation: Use `geopy.distance.distance(location1, location2).km` (Question 52).\n\n#### **3. Data Preprocessing & Exploration**\n- **Pandas**:\n  - **Exploratory Analysis**: `pandas-profiling` generates reports with outliers, correlations, etc. (Question 6).\n  - **One-Hot Encoding**: Convert categorical variables (e.g., `AA`, `BB`, `CC`) to binary columns using `pandas.get_dummies()` (Questions 20, 57).\n  - **Value Counts**: `df['column'].value_counts()` for categorical distributions (Question 22).\n- **Outlier Handling**:\n  - **IQR Analysis**: Remove outliers for continuous data (Question 49).\n- **Excel**:\n  - **Text-to-Columns**: Supports delimiters like comma, tab, semicolon, tilde (Question 16).\n  - **Correlation**: `Data Analysis Toolpak` computes correlations without requiring input/target separation (Question 40).\n  - **Regression**: Use `Data Analysis Toolpak` for linear regression (Question 63).\n  - **Pivot Tables**: Quick data summarization (Question 51).\n  - **Date Functions**: `WEEKNUM()` extracts week numbers (Question 39).\n  - **Outlier Detection**: **Box-and-Whisker plots** (Question 37).\n- **Anonymization**:\n  - **Static Anonymization**: Sufficient for one-time use (Question 19).\n  - **Tools**: Anonimatron, ARX, Amnesia, sdcMicro (not Power BI) (Question 18).\n  - **Data Categories**:\n    - Identifying, quasi-identifying, sensitive, **insensitive** (not \"non-identifying\") (Question 48).\n\n#### **4. Web Scraping & APIs**\n- **BeautifulSoup** (`bs4`):\n  - **Methods**: `find()`, `find_all()`, `prettify()` (Question 61).\n  - **Inspect Element**: Use **Developer Tools** (Browser) to analyze website structure before scraping (Question 13).\n  - **Extract HTML**: `requests.get(url).text` + `BeautifulSoup(html, 'html.parser')` (Question 14).\n  - **Find Specific Tags**: `soup.find_all('span', attrs={'class': 'wr-value--temperature--c'})` (Question 53).\n- **APIs**:\n  - **Nominatim**: Geocode addresses or reverse-geocode coordinates (Question 56).\n  - **BBC Weather API**: Returns JSON (Question 36).\n  - **Inspect API Calls**: Use **Network tab** in browser DevTools (Question 34).\n  - **Construct API URLs**: `urllib` library (Question 35).\n\n#### **5. Machine Learning & Statistics**\n- **Scikit-Learn**:\n  - **Decision Trees**: Handle class imbalance with `class_weight` parameter (Question 23).\n  - **K-Means**:\n    - Sensitive to initial centroids; mitigate with `n_init` (multiple initializations) (Question 21).\n    - Not for categorical data (Question 42).\n  - **Metrics**:\n    - **MAE**: `mean_absolute_error(y_true, y_pred)` (Question 24).\n    - **Classification Report**: Text summary of precision/recall/F1 (Question 31).\n- **Time Series**:\n  - **Autocorrelation**: Lag-1 correlation implies dependency on the previous observation (Question 44).\n  - **ARIMA**: `order=(p,d,q)` where `p`=AR lag, `d`=differencing, `q`=MA lag.\n    - Example: AR(4) with differencing=1 \u2192 `order=(4,1,0)` (Question 25).\n- **Azure ML (Excel Plugin)**: Outputs **sentiment** and **score** (Question 4).\n- **PyCaret**: Low-code ML library (Question 26).\n\n#### **6. Text & Sentiment Analysis**\n- **TextBlob**:\n  - **Sentiment Analysis**: Returns **polarity** (-1 to 1) and **subjectivity** (0 to 1).\n    - Polarity < 0: Negative sentiment (Question 29).\n    - Subjectivity \u2248 0.8: Opinionated (Question 28).\n- **ComicGen**:\n  - Creates data comics with custom characters/emotions.\n  - **Limitation**: Cannot auto-generate comics from typed text (Question 7).\n\n#### **7. Network Analysis**\n- **Scikit-Network**:\n  - Analyze large graphs (e.g., social networks, computer networks) (Questions 9, 60).\n- **Sparse Matrices**:\n  - `scipy.sparse.csr_matrix`: Efficient storage for matrices with many zeros (Questions 8, 32).\n\n#### **8. Programming & Libraries**\n- **Python**:\n  - **Wikipedia Data**: `wikipedia` library (not `BeautifulSoup` or `wikimedia`) (Question 11).\n  - **Streamlit**: Interactive widgets like `st.selectbox()` (Question 59).\n- **Excel**:\n  - **Azure ML Plugin**: Input/output ranges for sentiment analysis (Question 58).\n  - **Logical Expressions**: Tableau uses `IF...ELSEIF...ELSE` (but the example in Question 55 is invalid due to missing `END`).\n\n#### **9. Data Storytelling**\n- **Tools**:\n  - **ComicGen**: Narrate data stories via comics (Question 7).\n  - **Tableau Stories**: Sequential narratives (Question 46).\n\n---\n\n### **Key Equations (Math/Stats)**\n1. **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{MAE} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} |y_i - \\hat{y}_i|\n   \\]\n   - Implemented via `sklearn.metrics.mean_absolute_error` (Question 24).\n\n2. **Autocorrelation at Lag *k***:\n   \\[\n   \\rho_k = \\frac{\\text{Cov}(Y_t, Y_{t-k})}{\\sigma_Y^2}\n   \\]\n   - Y-axis in autocorrelation plot: **Correlation** (Question 17).\n\n3. **Linear Regression Slope**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Slope} = \\frac{\\text{Cov}(X, Y)}{\\text{Var}(X)}\n   \\]\n   - Excel: `SLOPE()` function (Question 62).\n\n4. **ARIMA Model Parameters**:\n   - **AR(*p*)**: Autoregressive lags.\n   - **I(*d*)**: Differencing order.\n   - **MA(*q*)**: Moving average lags.\n   - Example: `ARIMA(order=(4,1,0))` (Question 25).\n\n---\n\n### **Mermaid Knowledge Graphs**\n#### **Graph 1: Data Visualization & BI Tools**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Data Visualization] --> B[Power BI]\n    A --> C[Tableau]\n    A --> D[Google Data Studio]\n    A --> E[Kumu]\n\n    B --> B1[Geographic Visualization]\n    B --> B2[Quill Extension]\n    B2 --> B2a[Not for Summaries]\n\n    C --> C1[Map Visualization]\n    C1 --> C1a[Requires Lat/Long]\n    C --> C2[Worksheets]\n    C --> C3[Dashboards]\n    C --> C4[Stories]\n\n    D --> D1[Small-Scale Dashboards]\n    E --> E1[Network Visualization]\n```\n\n#### **Graph 2: Geospatial & Web Scraping**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    F[Geospatial Tools] --> G[QGIS]\n    G --> G1[Shapefile Creation]\n    G --> G2[Spatial Analysis]\n\n    F --> H[Nominatim API]\n    H --> H1[Geocoding]\n    H --> H2[Reverse Geocoding]\n    H --> H3[Distance Calculation]\n\n    I[Web Scraping] --> J[BeautifulSoup]\n    J --> J1[find/find_all]\n    J --> J2[prettify]\n    I --> K[Developer Tools]\n    K --> K1[Inspect Element]\n    K --> K2[Network Tab for APIs]\n\n    I --> L[requests Library]\n    L --> L1[Fetch HTML]\n```\n\n#### **Graph 3: Machine Learning & Text Analysis**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    M[Machine Learning] --> N[Scikit-Learn]\n    N --> N1[Decision Trees]\n    N1 --> N1a[class_weight for Imbalance]\n    N --> N2[K-Means]\n    N2 --> N2a[n_init for Stability]\n    N --> N3[Metrics]\n    N3 --> N3a[MAE]\n    N3 --> N3b[Classification Report]\n\n    M --> O[Time Series]\n    O --> O1[ARIMA]\n    O1 --> O1a[order=p,d,q]\n    O --> O2[Autocorrelation]\n\n    P[Text Analysis] --> Q[TextBlob]\n    Q --> Q1[Sentiment Polarity]\n    Q --> Q2[Subjectivity]\n    P --> R[Azure ML Excel Plugin]\n    R --> R1[Sentiment/Score Output]\n```\n\n#### **Graph 4: Data Preprocessing & Excel**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    S[Data Preprocessing] --> T[Pandas]\n    T --> T1[get_dummies for One-Hot]\n    T --> T2[value_counts]\n    T --> T3[pandas-profiling]\n\n    S --> U[Excel]\n    U --> U1[Data Analysis Toolpak]\n    U1 --> U1a[Correlation]\n    U1 --> U1b[Regression]\n    U --> U2[Pivot Tables]\n    U --> U3[WEEKNUM]\n\n    S --> V[Outlier Handling]\n    V --> V1[IQR Analysis]\n    V --> V2[Box Plots]\n```\n\n#### **Graph 5: APIs & Anonymization**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    W[APIs] --> X[Nominatim]\n    X --> X1[Geocode Addresses]\n    X --> X2[Reverse Geocode]\n\n    W --> Y[BBC Weather API]\n    Y --> Y1[JSON Output]\n\n    Z[Anonymization] --> Z1[Static Anonymization]\n    Z --> Z2[Tools: ARX, Amnesia]\n    Z --> Z3[Data Categories]\n    Z3 --> Z3a[Identifying]\n    Z3 --> Z3b[Quasi-Identifying]\n    Z3 --> Z3c[Sensitive]\n```",
