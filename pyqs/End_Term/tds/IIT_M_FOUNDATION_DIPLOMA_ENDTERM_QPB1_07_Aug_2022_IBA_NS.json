        "summary": "Here\u2019s a structured **summary of core topics, concepts, and tools** covered in the exam, along with **key equations** (where applicable) and **Mermaid knowledge graphs** to visualize relationships.\n\n---\n\n---\n\n### **Core Topics & Concepts Summary**\n#### **1. Data Visualization & BI Tools**\n- **Power BI**:\n  - Visualization of geographic/demographic data (e.g., GDP by country).\n  - **Limitation**: No native summary generation (Question 2).\n  - Extensions like **Quill** (for NLP-based summaries) are not directly integrated.\n- **Tableau**:\n  - Requires **latitude/longitude** for map visualizations (Question 15).\n  - **Logical calculations** (e.g., `IF [Profit] > 0 THEN 'Profitable' ELSE 'Loss'` are valid, but `ELSEIF` is not supported in Tableau\u2019s syntax; use `ELSE IF` instead (Question 16)).\n- **Excel**:\n  - **Correlation analysis**: Use `CORREL()` for pairwise correlations or **Data Analysis Toolpak** for matrices (Question 7).\n  - **Charts for outliers**: **Box-and-whisker plots** (Question 43).\n  - **Azure ML Excel Add-in**: Outputs **sentiment scores** and **labels** (Question 4).\n\n#### **2. Geospatial Data & Tools**\n- **QGIS**:\n  - Create/edit **shapefiles** and analyze spatial data (e.g., health indicators by district) (Question 3).\n- **Geopy**:\n  - Compute distances between coordinates using:\n    ```python\n    geopy.distance.distance(location1, location2).km  # Correct syntax (Question 5)\n    ```\n- **Nominatim (Geocoding)**:\n  - Get **latitude/longitude** of locations (e.g., \"IIT Madras\"):\n    ```python\n    from geopy.geocoders import Nominatim\n    locator = Nominatim(user_agent=\"myGeocoder\")\n    location = locator.geocode(\"IIT Madras, Chennai, India\")\n    print(location.latitude, location.longitude)  # Question 19\n    ```\n  - Can also retrieve **location types** (e.g., tourist, historic) (Question 20).\n\n#### **3. Web Scraping**\n- **Tools/Libraries**:\n  - **Requests**: Fetch HTML content (Question 18).\n  - **BeautifulSoup**: Parse HTML (e.g., extract weather data):\n    ```python\n    soup.find_all('span', attrs={'class': 'wr-day-temperature__high-value'})  # Question 6\n    ```\n  - **Developer Tools**: Inspect website structure before scraping (Question 17).\n- **APIs**:\n  - **BBC Weather API**: Returns data in **JSON** format (Question 42).\n  - **Inspect API calls** in browsers via the **Network tab** (Question 40).\n  - **Urllib**: Construct API URLs (Question 41).\n\n#### **4. Data Preprocessing**\n- **Handling Categorical Data**:\n  - **One-hot encoding**: Convert categories (e.g., AA, BB, CC) to binary columns (Questions 25, 26).\n    ```python\n    pd.get_dummies(df['column'])  # Pandas method\n    ```\n- **Anonymization**:\n  - Tools: **Anonimatron**, **ARX**, **Amnesia**, **sdcMicro** (Question 23).\n  - **Static anonymization**: Sufficient for one-time use (Question 24).\n- **Outlier Detection**:\n  - **Pandas-Profiling**: Generates reports with outlier stats (Question 8).\n  - **Box plots** in Excel/Tableau (Question 43).\n\n#### **5. Machine Learning**\n- **Scikit-Learn**:\n  - **K-Means**: Use `n_init` to reduce sensitivity to initial centroids (Question 27).\n  - **Decision Trees**: Handle class imbalance with `class_weight` (Question 29).\n  - **Metrics**:\n    - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**:\n      ```python\n      from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error\n      ```\n      Formula:\n      \\[\n      \\text{MAE} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} |y_i - \\hat{y}_i| \\quad \\text{(Question 30)}\n      \\]\n  - **Classification Reports**: Summarize precision, recall, F1-score (Question 37).\n- **ARIMA Models**:\n  - Syntax: `ARIMA(order=(p, d, q))` where:\n    - `p`: Autoregression lag (e.g., 4).\n    - `d`: Differencing order (e.g., 1).\n    - `q`: Moving average (e.g., 0) (Question 31).\n- **Keras**:\n  - **Loss functions**:\n    - **Categorical cross-entropy**: For multi-class classification (e.g., fruit types) (Question 36).\n\n#### **6. Text & Sentiment Analysis**\n- **TextBlob**:\n  - Returns **polarity** (sentiment) and **subjectivity** (opinion vs. fact) scores (Questions 33\u201335).\n    - **Polarity**: `-1` (negative) to `1` (positive).\n    - **Subjectivity**: `0` (factual) to `1` (opinionated).\n- **Azure ML Excel Add-in**:\n  - Input: Text data (e.g., movie reviews).\n  - Output: Sentiment scores (Question 44).\n\n#### **7. Network & Graph Analysis**\n- **Scipy**:\n  - **`csr_matrix`**: Efficient storage for **sparse matrices** (many zeros) (Questions 11, 38).\n- **Scikit-Network**:\n  - Analyze **large graphs** (e.g., social networks) (Questions 12, 39).\n- **Kumu**:\n  - Visualize **complex network data** (Question 13).\n\n#### **8. Low-Code/No-Code Tools**\n- **PyCaret**: Low-code ML library (Question 32).\n- **ComicGen**:\n  - Create **data comics** (custom characters/emotions) but **cannot** auto-generate comics from text (Question 10).\n- **Google Data Studio**: Build **dashboards** (Question 39).\n\n#### **9. Data Structures & Efficiency**\n- **Sparse Matrices**:\n  - Use `csr_matrix` when >50% of entries are zero (Question 38).\n- **Excel Functions**:\n  - **Text-to-columns**: Supports delimiters like comma, tab, semicolon, **and tilde (~)** (Question 21).\n\n#### **10. Time Series Analysis**\n- **Autocorrelation Plots**:\n  - **Y-axis**: Correlation coefficients (Question 22).\n\n---\n\n### **Mermaid Knowledge Graphs**\n#### **1.
