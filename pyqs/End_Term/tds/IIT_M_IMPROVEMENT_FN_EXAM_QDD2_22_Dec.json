This assistant is used by students to learn concepts in geospatial analysis, optimization, and data science. This bot will be highly helpful for students in solving the questions given in the context of \u201cEmergency Medical Supply Delivery in Storm-Critical Zones\u201d in this question paper. The goal of the assistant is to help students think critically and solve problems independently without receiving direct answers or step-by-step solutions. \nThe instructor defines the following constraints for the LLM assistant (EduBot): \n1. <b>Do not provide final answers</b> \u2014 If a student asks for the solution, the agent must not give the final answer. 2. <b>Do not provide step-by-step code</b> \u2014 The agent must avoid giving Python, SQL, or R code directly. 3. <b>Encourage critical thinking</b> \u2014 The agent should guide students using <b>reflective questions, </b><b>sanity checks, and logical reasoning.</b>\n4. <b>Use context-aware prompts</b> \u2014 The agent should recognize when a student might have made a conceptual mistake (like unit errors) and provide guidance. \nThe instructor asks you, as part of a course assignment, to <b>design the system prompt</b> that will be sent to OpenAI\u2019s API for creating this LLM-based agent. Your task is to answer the given sub-questions to ensure EduBot works as expected.",

        "summary": "Here\u2019s a structured summary of the core topics, concepts, principles, and equations from the question paper, along with Mermaid knowledge graphs to visualize relationships.\n\n---\n\n## **Core Topics and Concepts Summary**\n\n### **1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**\n#### **Key Concepts:**\n- **Excel Text-to-Columns Tool**:\n  - Used to split delimited text into separate columns.\n  - If no delimiter is specified, the tool may split each character into separate cells (e.g., `\"OrderID123\"` \u2192 `O, r, d, e, r, I, D, 1, 2, 3`).\n- **Data Deduplication**:\n  - Tools like **OpenRefine** are ideal for cleaning inconsistent data (e.g., `'John Doe'`, `'JOHN DOE'`).\n  - Excel, MySQL, and Tableau lack advanced deduplication features.\n\n#### **Key Tools:**\n| Tool          | Use Case                                  |\n|---------------|------------------------------------------|\n| OpenRefine     | Cleaning messy data (deduplication, trimming) |\n| Excel         | Basic text splitting (`Text to Columns`)  |\n| MySQL         | SQL-based filtering but not deduplication |\n| Tableau       | Visualization, not data cleaning         |\n\n---\n\n### **2. Machine Learning Concepts**\n#### **Key Concepts:**\n- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**:\n  - **Bias-Variance Tradeoff**:\n    - Low `K` (e.g., `K=2`) \u2192 High variance (overfitting, high training accuracy, low test accuracy).\n    - High `K` (e.g., `K=6`) \u2192 Lower variance (better generalization).\n  - **Cross-Validation**: Used to select optimal `K`.\n- **K-Means Clustering**:\n  - **Stability Issue**: Different runs may produce varying cluster assignments due to random initialization.\n  - **Solution**: Increase `n_init` (number of initializations) for consistent results.\n\n#### **Key Parameters:**\n| Parameter  | Purpose                                  | Default Value |\n|------------|------------------------------------------|---------------|\n| `n_init`   | Number of times K-Means runs with different centroid seeds | 10            |\n| `n_clusters`| Number of clusters (`K`)                | User-defined  |\n\n#### **Equations:**\n- **KNN Distance Metric (Euclidean)**:\n  \\[\n  d(\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{y}) = \\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - y_i)^2}\n  \\]\n- **K-Means Objective (Inertia)**:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Inertia} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\min_{\\mu_j \\in C} \\|x_i - \\mu_j\\|^2\n  \\]\n  where \\(C\\) is the set of centroids.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Time Series Analysis (ARIMA)**\n#### **Key Concepts:**\n- **ARIMA Model**:\n  - **Components**:\n    - `p`: Autoregressive (AR) lags.\n    - `d`: Differencing order (for stationarity).\n    - `q`: Moving Average (MA) terms.\n  - **Specification**:\n    - `ARIMA(order=(p, d, q))` (e.g., `ARIMA(order=(5, 1, 0))` for 5 AR lags, 1 differencing, no MA).\n\n#### **Key Equations:**\n- **ARIMA Model**:\n  \\[\n  y_t = c + \\sum_{i=1}^{p} \\phi_i y_{t-i} + \\sum_{j=1}^{q} \\theta_j \\epsilon_{t-j} + \\epsilon_t\n  \\]\n  where \\(\\epsilon_t\\) is white noise.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Web Development and Debugging**\n#### **Key Concepts:**\n- **Chrome DevTools**:\n  - **Application Tab**: Inspect cookies (e.g., session cookies).\n  - **Network Tab**: Monitor API calls (e.g., button-click triggers).\n- **Streamlit**:\n  - Display text: `st.text(\"Hello\")` (not `st.add_text()` or `st.display_text()`).\n\n#### **Key Tools:**\n| Tool          | Tab/Feature       | Use Case                          |\n|---------------|-------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| Chrome DevTools| **Application**   | Inspect cookies/local storage     |\n|               | **Network**       | Monitor API requests/responses   |\n| Streamlit     | `st.text()`       | Display static text               |\n|               | `st.selectbox()`  | Create dropdown filters           |\n\n---\n\n### **5. Geospatial Analysis**\n#### **Key Concepts:**\n- **Haversine Formula**:\n  - Calculates **great-circle distance** between two points on a sphere (e.g., Earth).\n  - **Steps**:\n    1. Convert degrees to radians.\n    2. Compute differences in latitude (\\(\\Delta \\varphi\\)) and longitude (\\(\\Delta \\lambda\\)).\n    3. Apply the formula:\n       \\[\n       d = 2r \\cdot \\arcsin\\left(\\sqrt{a}\\right), \\quad a = \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\Delta \\varphi}{2}\\right) + \\cos(\\varphi_1) \\cos(\\varphi_2) \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\Delta \\lambda}{2}\\right)\n       \\]\n       where \\(r = 6371\\) km (Earth\u2019s radius).\n- **Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP)**:\n  - Optimizes routes for visiting multiple locations.\n  - **Tools**: Python libraries like `NetworkX`, `OR-Tools`, or `SciPy`.\n\n#### **Key Libraries:**\n| Library      | Use Case                                  |\n|--------------|------------------------------------------|\n| Geopandas    | Geospatial data manipulation             |\n| Folium       | Interactive maps                          |\n| NetworkX     | TSP route optimization                    |\n| OR-Tools     | Advanced optimization (Google\u2019s solver)  |\n\n---\n\n### **6. Log File Analysis**\n#### **Key Concepts:**\n- **Apache Log Format**:\n  - Fields: `IP`, `Time`, `Request (Method/URL/Protocol)`, `Status`, `Size`, etc.\n  - Example:\n    ```\n    40.77.167.48 - - [30/Apr/2024:07:12:09 -0500] \"GET /mplayer2.jsz HTTP/1.1\" 200 7416\n    ```\n- **Filtering Logs**:\n  - **Time Parsing**: Use `%d/%b/%Y:%H:%M:%S %Z` (e.g., `01/May/2024:10:00:00 +0000`).\n  - **Saturday Check**: `timestamp.weekday() == 5` (Monday=0, Sunday=6).\n  - **Time Range**: `10 <= timestamp.hour < 21`.\n  - **URL Filtering**: `url.startswith('/telugump3/')`.\n  - **Status Code**: `200 <= status < 300` (successful requests).\n\n#### **Key Python Snippets:**\n```python\n# Parse time\nfrom datetime import datetime\ntime_str = \"[01/May/2024:10:00:00 +0000]\"\ndt = datetime.strptime(time_str.strip(\"[]\"), \"%d/%b/%Y:%H:%M:%S %Z\")\n\n# Check Saturday\nif dt.weekday() == 5:  # Saturday\n\n# Extract URL from request\nrequest = \"GET /telugump3/song1 HTTP/1.1\"\nurl = request.split()[1]  # '/telugump3/song1'\n```\n\n---\n\n### **7. LLM and Prompt Engineering**\n#### **Key Concepts:**\n- **System Prompt Design**:\n  - Defines the LLM\u2019s role, constraints, and interaction style.\n  - **Goals**:\n    - Avoid direct answers/step-by-step code.\n    - Encourage critical thinking (e.g., reflective questions, sanity checks).\n- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**:\n  - **Workflow**:\n    1. Store course material in a vector database (e.g., FAISS).\n    2. Retrieve relevant chunks based on semantic similarity.\n    3. Augment LLM prompt with retrieved context for personalized responses.\n\n#### **Example System Prompt:**\n```\nYou are a teaching assistant for a Data Science course.\n- Do not provide final answers or direct code.\n- Guide students using reflective questions (e.g., \"How would you validate this calculation?\").\n- If a student makes a unit error (e.g., radians vs. degrees), ask them to double-check conversions.\n```\n\n---\n\n### **8. Optimization and Routing**\n#### **Key Concepts:**\n- **Nearest Neighbor vs. TSP**:\n  - **Nearest Neighbor**: Greedy approach (visit closest unvisited location next).\n  - **TSP**: Global optimization for shortest route (NP-hard; use solvers like `OR-Tools`).\n- **Tools for Route Optimization**:\n  | Tool          | Use Case                                  |\n  |---------------|------------------------------------------|\n  | QGIS          | GIS analysis (not optimization)         |\n  | NetworkX      | Basic TSP implementations                |\n  | OR-Tools      | Advanced route optimization              |\n\n---\n\n## **Mermaid Knowledge Graphs**\n\n### **1.
