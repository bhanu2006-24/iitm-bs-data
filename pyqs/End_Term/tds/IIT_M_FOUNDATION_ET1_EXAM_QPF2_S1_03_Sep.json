        "summary": "Here\u2019s a structured **summary of core topics, concepts, and tools** covered in the exam, followed by **Mermaid knowledge graphs** to visualize relationships.\n\n---\n\n### **Core Topics & Concepts Summary**\n#### **1. Data Visualization & BI Tools**\n- **Power BI**: Visualization (maps, charts), extensions (Quill for summaries).\n- **Tableau**:\n  - File structure: *Worksheet* (single view), *Dashboard* (collection of views), *Story* (sequence of worksheets/dashboards).\n  - Map visualization requires **geographic roles** (latitude/longitude or valid place names).\n  - Logical calculations use `IF-ELSEIF-ELSE` (but Tableau\u2019s syntax is `IF [Profit] > 0 THEN 'Profitable' ELSEIF [Profit] = 0 THEN 'Breakeven' ELSE 'Loss' END`).\n- **Excel**:\n  - Charts: *Box-and-whisker plots* for outliers.\n  - Functions: `WEEKNUM()` to extract week numbers, `CORREL()` for pairwise correlations (no limit on variables).\n  - *Data Analysis Toolpak*: Regression, correlation (no need to specify input/target separately).\n  - *Text-to-Columns*: Supports delimiters like comma, tab, semicolon, but **not tilde (~)**.\n  - *Azure ML Plugin*: Outputs **Sentiment** and **Score** (not Percentage).\n\n#### **2. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**\n- **Outlier Handling**: *IQR analysis* (Interquartile Range).\n- **Anonymization**:\n  - Tools: *Anonimatron*, *ARX*, *Amnesia*, *sdcMicro*.\n  - *Static anonymization* is sufficient for one-time use.\n  - **Power BI cannot anonymize data**.\n- **Categorical Encoding**:\n  - *One-hot encoding* (e.g., `pandas.get_dummies`) increases **columns** (not rows).\n  - Example:\n    ```python\n    # Original: ['CC', 'AA', 'BB', 'AA']\n    # Encoded:\n    | AA | BB | CC |\n    |----|----|----|\n    | 0  | 0  | 1  |\n    | 1  | 0  | 0  |\n    ```\n\n#### **3. Geospatial Data**\n- **QGIS**: Create shapefiles and analyze geographic data (e.g., health indicators by district).\n- **Nominatim API** (Python `geopy`):\n  - Get latitude/longitude:\n    ```python\n    from geopy.geocoders import Nominatim\n    locator = Nominatim(user_agent=\"myGeocoder\")\n    location = locator.geocode(\"IIT Madras, Chennai, India\")\n    print(location.latitude, location.longitude)\n    ```\n  - Retrieve *place type* (e.g., tourist, historic) from coordinates.\n- **Distance Calculation**:\n  ```python\n  from geopy.distance import distance\n  distances_km.append(distance(location1, location2).km)\n  ```\n\n#### **4. Web Scraping**\n- **Libraries**:\n  - `requests`: Fetch HTML content.\n  - `BeautifulSoup`: Parse HTML (methods: `find()`, `find_all()`, `prettify()`).\n  - `Developer Tools` (Browser): Inspect website structure before scraping.\n- **Example**: Extract temperature data:\n  ```python\n  daily_high_values = soup.find_all('span', attrs={'class': 'wr-value--temperature--c'})\n  ```\n- **APIs**:\n  - Inspect API calls in browser\u2019s **Network tab**.\n  - Construct URLs with `urllib`.\n  - BBC Weather API outputs **JSON**.\n\n#### **5. Machine Learning & Statistics**\n- **Scikit-Learn**:\n  - **Decision Trees**: Handle class imbalance with `class_weight`.\n  - **K-Means**: Sensitive to initial centroids; mitigate with `n_init`.\n  - **Metrics**:\n    - `mean_absolute_error` for average absolute error.\n    - `classification_report` for precision/recall/F1.\n  - **ARIMA**: `order=(p,d,q)` where `p=4` (AR lag), `d=1` (differencing), `q=0` (MA).\n    ```python\n    ARIMA(order=(4,1,0))\n    ```\n- **Sentiment Analysis** (`TextBlob`):\n  - Returns **polarity** (-1 to 1, negative to positive) and **subjectivity** (0 to 1, factual to opinionated).\n  - Example: Polarity = -0.5 \u2192 Negative sentiment; Subjectivity = 0.8 \u2192 Opinionated.\n- **PyCaret**: Low-code ML library (not a visualization tool).\n- **Autocorrelation**: Lag-1 autocorrelation means current observation correlates with the **previous** one.\n\n#### **6. Data Structures & Optimization**\n- **Sparse Matrices** (`scipy.sparse.csr_matrix`): Efficient for matrices with many zeros.\n- **Graph Analysis** (`scikit-network`): Social network analysis, large graph tools.\n\n#### **7. Python Pandas**\n- **Exploratory Analysis**: `pandas-profiling` (detects outliers, missing values).\n- **Grouping**: `value_counts()` for categorical data (e.g., salary ranges).\n  ```python\n  DF['salary_range'].value_counts()\n  ```\n\n#### **8. Deep Learning (Keras)**\n- **Loss Functions**:\n  - *Categorical crossentropy* for multi-class classification (e.g., fruit groups).\n  - *Binary crossentropy* for binary classification.\n\n#### **9. Other Tools**\n- **ComicGen**: Narrate data stories via comics (cannot directly import Excel/Google Sheets data).\n- **Kumu**: Visualize **complex network data** (not project management).\n- **Google Data Studio**: Create **dashboards** (small/large scale).\n- **Streamlit**: Interactive widgets (e.g., `st.selectbox` for dropdowns).\n\n---\n\n### **Mermaid Knowledge Graphs**\n#### **1.
