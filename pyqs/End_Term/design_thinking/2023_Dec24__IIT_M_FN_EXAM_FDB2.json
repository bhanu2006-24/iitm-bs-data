Instructions: Step 0: Ensure that you write the problem statement and question number clearly on the answer sheet. Step 1: Allocate one or two pages to personas, journey maps, and a list of problems. Step 2:Dedicate one page to identifying the root cause. Step 3: Allocate one page to identify desired results and summarize 2 to 3 'problem questions' to solve. Step 4: List the ideas in 50 words (not exceeding 5 sentences/ 5 ideas), in one page. Step 5: Sketch 2-3 wireframes of the product/service/app you will be developing, in one page. Step 6: Summarize how you'll iterate and what you\u2019ll do for customers in the future to improve or expand upon the solution, in one page.  The suggested time for this question is 30 minutes. You may use the given sheets in portrait or landscape mode. Do not exceed more than 8 pages to answer the question.  CHOOSE AND ATTEMPT ONLY ONE QUESTION.

Begin by empathizing, developing a persona, and mapping out the user journey to identify problems. Analyze by determining the root cause and reasons for addressing the issues. Progress to the Solve phase by fleshing out ideas and creating low-fi wireframes/sketches on paper. Finally, demonstrate how your ideas address the problem and propose improvements.  Instructions: Step 0: Ensure that you write the problem statement and question number clearly on the answer sheet. Step 1: Allocate one or two pages to personas, journey maps, and a list of problems. Step 2:Dedicate one page to identifying the root cause. Step 3: Allocate one page to identify desired results and summarize 2 to 3 'problem questions' to solve. Step 4: List the ideas in 50 words (not exceeding 5 sentences/ 5 ideas), in one page. Step 5: Sketch 2-3 wireframes of the product/service/app you will be developing, in one page. Step 6: Summarize how you'll iterate and what you\u2019ll do for customers in the future to improve or expand upon the solution, in one page.  The suggested time for this question is 30 minutes. You may use the given sheets in portrait or landscape mode. Do not exceed more than 8 pages to answer the question.  CHOOSE AND ATTEMPT ONLY ONE QUESTION. Write the problem statement and question number clearly on the answer sheet. The suggested time for this question is 30 minutes.  1. A. Your customer is a hotel industry worker. They face challenges at work as well as in their personal life. There exist worries like managing guest requests efficiently while maintaining service quality. The worker often struggles with multiple tasks, leading to potential errors and delays, affecting customer satisfaction. Also, the work days extend over long hours causing fatigue and physical and mental stress, which have their consequences.  OR   1. B. Stop unwanted subscription fees: It\u2019s hard to keep track of all the products and services that we have subscribed to every month. All we see is money deducted from our accounts, sometimes from services that we don\u2019t need anymore. How can you design a product/ service which helps manage subscriptions?"

        "summary": "Here\u2019s a structured **summary of core topics, concepts, and principles** for the **Design Thinking** exam, along with **Mermaid knowledge graphs** to visualize relationships.\n\n---\n\n## **Core Topics & Concepts Summary**\n### **1. Design Thinking Process**\n- **Phases**:\n  1. **Empathize** (User Research, Personas, Journey Maps, Empathy Gap)\n  2. **Define** (Root Cause Analysis, Problem Statements, \"How Might We\" Questions)\n  3. **Ideate** (Brainstorming, Silent Brainstorming, Inventive Solution Triggers)\n  4. **Prototype** (Low-Fidelity vs. High-Fidelity, Rapid Prototyping)\n  5. **Test** (User Feedback, Iteration)\n- **Key Principle**: **Holistic Design** (Balancing user needs, technical feasibility, and business viability).\n\n#### **Key Equations/Frameworks**:\n- **Three Pillars of Innovation**:\n  `Innovation = (Technical Feasibility) \u2229 (Business Viability) \u2229 (Customer Desirability)`\n- **\"How Might We\" (HMW) Framework**:\n  `HMW = [User Need] + [Desired Outcome] + [Constraint/Opportunity]`\n\n---\n\n### **2. User Experience (UX) & Prototyping**\n- **Low-Fidelity Prototype**: Quick, rough sketches (goal: **brainstorming & iteration**).\n- **High-Fidelity Prototype**: Detailed, interactive (goal: **usability testing**).\n- **Responsive Web Design**: Adapts to **device screen size**.\n- **UX Framework Benefits**:\n  - User-centric solutions.\n  - Iterative improvement.\n  - Problem-solving focus.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Agile & Innovation**\n- **Agile Methodologies**: Iterative development with **user feedback**.\n- **System Seeking**: Recognizing **patterns & connections** in complex systems.\n- **Bulletproofing Ideas**: Evaluating **feasibility, desirability, adaptability**.\n- **Intrapreneurship vs. Crowdsourcing**:\n  - **Intrapreneurship**: Internal innovation (employees drive ideas).\n  - **Crowdsourcing**: External input (users/public contribute ideas).\n\n---\n\n### **4. Digital Marketing & App Optimization**\n- **App Store Optimization (ASO)**: Improve **visibility in app stores** (keywords, metadata).\n- **Google App Campaigns (UAC)**: Uses **machine learning** for targeted ads.\n- **Referral Marketing**: Leverages **social proof & trust** for user acquisition.\n- **Mobile-Friendly Websites**: Critical for **user engagement** (50%+ traffic is mobile).\n\n#### **Key Metrics**:\n- **Brand Recall**: `Brand Strength = (Recognition + Differentiation) / Competition`\n- **Cost Per Install (CPI)**: `CPI = Total Ad Spend / Number of Installs`\n\n---\n\n### **5. Conflict & Stakeholder Balance**\n- **Empathy Gap**: Difference between **designer assumptions** and **user reality**.\n- **\"Fly on the Wall\" Technique**: Observe **natural user behavior** (vs. interviews).\n- **Holistic Design**: Balancing **user needs, business goals, technical constraints**.\n\n---\n\n### **6. Problem-Solving Techniques**\n- **Root Cause Analysis (5 Whys, Fishbone Diagram)**.\n- **Rapid Prototyping**: Test **sizing, UI changes** quickly (e.g., digital mockups for clothing).\n- **Silent Brainstorming**: Individual idea generation before group discussion.\n\n---\n\n## **Mermaid Knowledge Graphs**\n### **Graph 1: Design Thinking Process Flow**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Empathize] -->|User Research| B[Define]\n    B -->|Problem Statement| C[Ideate]\n    C -->|Brainstorming| D[Prototype]\n    D -->|Low/High-Fidelity| E[Test]\n    E -->|User Feedback| A\n    E -->|Iteration| C\n```\n\n### **Graph 2: Three Pillars of Innovation**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Innovation] --> B[Technical Feasibility]\n    A --> C[Business Viability]\n    A --> D[Customer Desirability]\n    B -->|Can we build it?| E[Prototype]\n    C -->|Should we build it?| E\n    D -->|Do users want it?| E\n```\n\n### **Graph 3: UX & Prototyping Relationships**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[UX Design] --> B[Low-Fidelity Prototype]\n    A --> C[High-Fidelity Prototype]\n    B -->|Goal: Brainstorming| D[Wireframes]\n    C -->|Goal: Usability Testing| D\n    D --> E[User Feedback]\n    E -->|Iterate| B\n```\n\n### **Graph 4: Digital Marketing Ecosystem**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[App Marketing] --> B[ASO]\n    A --> C[Google App Campaigns]\n    A --> D[Referral Marketing]\n    B -->|Improve Visibility| E[App Store Ranking]\n    C -->|Machine Learning| F[Targeted Ads]\n    D -->|Social Proof| G[User Trust]\n    E & F & G --> H[Higher Installs]\n```\n\n### **Graph 5: Conflict & Stakeholder Balance**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Design Thinking] --> B[Empathy Gap]\n    A --> C[Holistic Design]\n    B -->|Designer vs. User| D[User Research]\n    C -->|Balance| E[Stakeholders]\n    C -->|Balance| F[Technical Feasibility]\n    C -->|Balance| G[Business Goals]\n    D --> H[Personas/Journey Maps]\n```\n\n---\n## **Key Takeaways for Exam**\n1. **Design Thinking Phases**: Memorize the **5 stages** and their outputs (e.g., personas in Empathize, HMW questions in Define).\n2. **Prototyping**: Know the **difference between low-fi and high-fi** prototypes.\n3. **Innovation Pillars**: **Feasibility + Viability + Desirability** must intersect.\n4. **Agile & Feedback**: Agile relies on **continuous user feedback**.\n5. **Digital Marketing**: ASO = **visibility**; UAC = **ML-based ads**; Referral = **trust**.\n6. **Conflict Resolution**: **Empathy Gap** = designer assumptions \u2260 user reality.\n7. **Problem-Solving**: Use **\"5 Whys\"** for root cause analysis.\n\n---\n### **Final Tips**\n- For **Section A (Case Study)**:\n  - Follow the **6-step structure** (personas \u2192 root cause \u2192 HMW \u2192 ideas \u2192 wireframes \u2192 iteration).\n  - Sketch **low-fi wireframes** (no need for perfection).\n- For **Section B (MCQs)**:\n  - Focus on **definitions** (e.g., ASO, UX frameworks, Agile).\n  - Eliminate **extreme options** (e.g., \"always,\" \"never\").",
