        "summary": "Here\u2019s a structured **summary of core topics, concepts, and principles** for the exam **\"Design Thinking for Data-Driven App Development\"**, along with **key equations** (where applicable) and **Mermaid knowledge graphs** to visualize relationships.\n\n---\n\n---\n\n### **Core Topics & Concepts Summary**\n#### **1. Design Thinking Framework**\n- **Phases**:\n  1. **Empathize**: Understand user needs (personas, journey maps).\n     - **Personas**: Demographics, needs, challenges, goals.\n     - **Customer Journey Map**: Actions, thoughts, pain points, emotions.\n  2. **Define**: Root cause analysis (Multi-Why, ENV Model).\n     - **Multi-Why Analysis**: Iterative \"Why?\" questions to uncover core issues.\n     - **ENV Model**:\n       - **E**lement (key conflict component),\n       - **N**ame (focus area),\n       - **V**alue (high/low).\n  3. **Ideate**: Brainstorm solutions (\"How Might We\" questions).\n  4. **Prototype**: Low-fi wireframes (horizontal vs. vertical prototypes).\n     - **Horizontal Prototype**: Surface-level design across user flows (e.g., UI mockups).\n     - **Vertical Prototype**: Deep dive into one feature (e.g., backend integration).\n  5. **Test**: Evaluate prototypes (user journey revisions, A/B testing).\n  6. **Close**: Document lessons, celebrate success, deliver product.\n\n- **Karmic Design Thinking**:\n  - Focuses on **continuous improvement** (\"Nirvana/Liberation\" as end goal).\n  - **Convergent Testing**: Narrowing down solutions based on feedback.\n\n#### **2. Prototyping & User Onboarding**\n- **Prototyping Types**:\n  - **Horizontal**: Explore broad user flows (e.g., UI navigation).\n  - **Vertical**: Test technical feasibility (e.g., database integration).\n- **Onboarding Design**:\n  - **Progressive Onboarding**: Interactive, step-by-step user guidance.\n  - **Gulfs of Interaction** (Don Norman):\n    - **Gulf of Execution**: \"How do I use this?\" (user \u2192 system).\n    - **Gulf of Evaluation**: \"Did this work?\" (system \u2192 user).\n\n#### **3. TRIZ Principles (Inventive Problem Solving)**\n| **Principle**       | **Description**                          | **Example**                                  |\n|----------------------|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|\n| **Segmentation**     | Divide object into independent parts.    | Modular sofa (rearrangeable sections).       |\n| **Merging**          | Combine functions/objects.              | Travel site (flights + hotels + cars).       |\n| **Dynamics**         | Adjust properties in real-time.          | Note-taking app (left/right-handed layouts). |\n| **Other Way Round**  | Invert the conventional approach.        | Endless pool (swim in place vs. lap pool).   |\n| **Universality**     | Design for multiple functions.           | Swiss Army knife.                            |\n\n#### **4. Project Management & Agile-Design Thinking Integration**\n- **IBM\u2019s Design Thinking Commitments**:\n  1. **Team-wide design thinking** (not just designers).\n  2. **Clarify design craft vs. design thinking**.\n  3. **Empower teams for customer-centric goals**.\n- **Project Closure**:\n  - Deliver product, assess outcomes, document lessons, celebrate.\n\n#### **5. App Marketing (AAR Framework)**\n- **AAR**: **Awareness** \u2192 **Acquisition** \u2192 **Retention**.\n  - **Awareness**: Attract users (ads, SEO).\n  - **Acquisition**: Convert users (onboarding, trials).\n  - **Retention**: Engage users (loyalty programs, updates).\n\n#### **6. Human-Centered Design Principles**\n- **Don Norman\u2019s Complexity Management**:\n  - Provide a **conceptual model** (e.g., mental map of how a system works).\n  - **Standards**: Consistency (e.g., icons, navigation).\n- **Cultural Considerations**:\n  - Adapt designs to local norms (e.g., color meanings, language).\n\n#### **7. Conflict Analysis (ENV Model)**\n- **Objective**: Structured framework to analyze conflicts.\n  - **Element**: Core issue (e.g., \"slow checkout process\").\n  - **Name**: Focus area (e.g., \"payment gateway\").\n  - **Value**: High/low priority.\n\n#### **8. Serendipity in Innovation**\n- **Definition**: Unplanned, beneficial discoveries (e.g., Post-it Notes).\n- **False**: Serendipity is **not** intentional.\n\n---\n\n### **Key Equations/Frameworks**\n1. **ENV Model**:\n   ```\n   Conflict = (Element, Name, Value[High/Low])\n   ```\n2. **Multi-Why Analysis**:\n   ```\n   Problem \u2192 Why? \u2192 Why? \u2192 Why? \u2192 Root Cause\n   ```\n3. **AAR Metrics**:\n   ```\n   Success = (Awareness \u00d7 Acquisition) \u00d7 Retention\n   ```\n\n---\n\n### **Mermaid Knowledge Graphs**\n#### **Graph 1: Design Thinking Phases**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Empathize] --> B[Define]\n    B --> C[Ideate]\n    C --> D[Prototype]\n    D --> E[Test]\n    E --> F[Close]\n    F -->|Lessons Learned| A\n```\n\n#### **Graph 2: TRIZ Principles & Examples**\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n    TRIZ[TRIZ Principles]\n    TRIZ --> A[Segmentation: Modular Sofa]\n    TRIZ --> B[Merging: Travel Booking Site]\n    TRIZ --> C[Dynamics: Note-Taking App]\n    TRIZ --> D[Other Way Round: Endless Pool]\n```\n\n#### **Graph 3: Gulfs of Interaction (Don Norman)**\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n    User[User] -->|Gulf of Execution| System[System]\n    System -->|Gulf of Evaluation| User\n```\n\n#### **Graph 4: Karmic Design Thinking Process**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    Start[Conflict/Problem] --> Empathize\n    Empathize --> Define[Root Cause: ENV/Multi-Why]\n    Define --> Ideate[How Might We?]\n    Ideate --> Prototype[Horizontal/Vertical]\n    Prototype --> Test[Convergent Testing]\n    Test -->|Iterate| Ideate\n    Test --> Close[Document & Liberate]\n```\n\n#### **Graph 5: AAR Framework (App Marketing)**\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n    A[Awareness: Ads/SEO] --> B[Acquisition: Onboarding]\n    B --> C[Retention: Engagement]\n    C -->|Feedback| A\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Exam Tips**\n1. **For Case Studies (Q3)**:\n   - Use **personas + journey maps** to identify pain points.\n   - Apply **ENV Model** and **Multi-Why** for root causes.\n   - Sketch **low-fi wireframes** (focus on user flow).\n2. **For TRIZ Questions**:\n   - Match examples to principles (e.g., \"modular\" = **Segmentation**).\n3. **For Theory (MCQs)**:\n   - **Gulfs**: Execution (how to use) vs. Evaluation (did it work?).\n   - **Karmic DT**: End goal is **Nirvana/Liberation**.\n   - **Serendipity**: Unplanned \u2260 intentional.",
