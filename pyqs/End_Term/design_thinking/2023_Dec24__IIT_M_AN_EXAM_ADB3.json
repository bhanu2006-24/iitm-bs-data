        "summary": "Here\u2019s a structured **summary of core topics, concepts, and principles** for the **Design Thinking** exam, along with **Mermaid knowledge graphs** to visualize relationships.\n\n---\n\n---\n\n### **Core Topics & Concepts Summary**\n#### **1. Design Thinking Process**\n- **Phases**:\n  1. **Empathize**: Understand user needs (personas, user journeys, \"Fly on the Wall\" technique).\n  2. **Define**: Identify root causes, problem statements, and \"How Might We\" (HMW) questions.\n  3. **Ideate**: Brainstorming (silent brainstorming, inventive triggers), prototyping (low-fi/high-fi).\n  4. **Prototype**: Rapid prototyping (digital/physical), wireframing, testing.\n  5. **Test**: Iterate based on user feedback.\n- **Key Tools**:\n  - **Personas**: Fictional user profiles (demographics, pain points, goals).\n  - **User Journey Maps**: Visualize user interactions/emotions over time.\n  - **Low-Fi Prototypes**: Sketches/paper models for quick iteration (goal: **brainstorming**, not perfection).\n  - **High-Fi Prototypes**: Interactive digital models for usability testing.\n  - **TRIZ Principles**: Systematic innovation (e.g., **Segmenting** for collapsible designs).\n\n#### **2. Innovation & Problem-Solving**\n- **Three Pillars of Innovation**:\n  1. **Desirability** (user needs),\n  2. **Feasibility** (technical/operational possibility),\n  3. **Viability** (business sustainability).\n- **Balancing Constraints**:\n  - Overemphasizing **feasibility** early limits creativity (\u2192 incremental, not radical solutions).\n  - **Holistic Design**: Balance user needs, technical limits, and business goals.\n- **Serendipity in Innovation**: Unpredictable challenges (e.g., Shivanasamudra power plant) require adaptability.\n- **Bulletproofing Ideas**: Evaluate solutions for **feasibility, desirability, adaptability** (not risk elimination).\n\n#### **3. Prototyping & Testing**\n- **Low-Fi vs. High-Fi Prototypes**:\n  | **Low-Fi**               | **High-Fi**               |\n  |--------------------------|---------------------------|\n  | Quick, cheap (paper/sketches) | Interactive, detailed (digital) |\n  | Goal: Brainstorming/iteration | Goal: Usability testing   |\n- **Rapid Prototyping Use Cases**:\n  - **Digital**: Simulate sizing options (e.g., clothing retailer).\n  - **Physical**: Test ergonomics (e.g., collapsible water bottle).\n- **Testing Methods**:\n  - **Usability Testing**: Observe users interacting with prototypes.\n  - **A/B Testing**: Compare two versions (e.g., CTAs on GroceriesGo website).\n\n#### **4. User-Centric Design (UX)**\n- **UX Framework Benefits**:\n  1. Solve user problems,\n  2. Iterate for better experiences,\n  3. Focus on **user needs** (not just profit).\n- **Empathy Techniques**:\n  - **Direct Interviews**: Best for articulate users.\n  - **\"Fly on the Wall\"**: Observe natural behavior (e.g., sensitive topics).\n- **Conflict Resolution in Design**:\n  - Deadlocks? **Revisit problem statements** or **prototype both solutions** (avoid voting).\n\n#### **5. Digital Marketing & App Optimization**\n- **App Store Optimization (ASO)**: Improve visibility in app stores (keywords, visuals, reviews).\n- **Google App Campaigns (UAC)**: Uses **machine learning** to target audiences (vs. traditional ads).\n- **Call-to-Action (CTA) Best Practices**:\n  - **Clear & Action-Oriented**: \"Get GroceriesGo Now\" > \"Learn More\".\n  - **Align with User Goals**: Busy professionals \u2192 emphasize **convenience/speed**.\n- **Brand Recall**: Secures mental space over competitors (\u2192 competitive advantage).\n\n#### **6. Agile & Project Management**\n- **Agile Methodologies**: Iterative, **user feedback-driven** (vs. waterfall).\n- **Projects vs. Routine Operations**:\n  - Projects: **Temporary**, defined goals, collaborative.\n  - Operations: **Ongoing**, repetitive tasks.\n\n#### **7. Business & Innovation Strategies**\n- **Intrapreneurship**: Employee-driven innovation within organizations.\n- **Crowdsourcing**: Tool to **implement intrapreneurship** (e.g., idea generation).\n- **Digital Marketing Checklist**: Plan campaigns for **awareness/engagement** (not just compliance).\n\n---\n\n### **Key Equations/Frameworks (Non-Math)**\n1. **Design Thinking Phases**:\n   `Empathize \u2192 Define \u2192 Ideate \u2192 Prototype \u2192 Test` (iterative loop).\n2. **Three Pillars of Innovation**:\n   `Desirability \u2229 Feasibility \u2229 Viability = Successful Innovation`.\n3. **TRIZ Principles** (Example):\n   - **Segmenting**: Divide object into independent parts (e.g., collapsible bottle).\n4. **UX Problem Statement**:\n   `[User] needs to [goal] because [insight]`.\n5. **Prototyping Hierarchy**:\n   `Low-Fi (Ideation) \u2192 Mid-Fi (Feedback) \u2192 High-Fi (Testing)`.\n\n---\n\n### **Mermaid Knowledge Graphs**\n\n#### **Graph 1: Design Thinking Process Flow**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Empathize] -->|Personas, Journey Maps| B[Define]\n    B -->|Problem Statements| C[Ideate]\n    C -->|Brainstorming, TRIZ| D[Prototype]\n    D -->|Low-Fi/High-Fi| E[Test]\n    E -->|User Feedback| A\n    style A fill:#f9f,stroke:#333\n    style B fill:#bbf,stroke:#333\n    style C fill:#f96,stroke:#333\n    style D fill:#6f9,stroke:#333\n    style E fill:#9cf,stroke:#333\n```\n\n#### **Graph 2: Three Pillars of Innovation**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Innovation] --> B[Desirability]\n    A --> C[Feasibility]\n    A --> D[Viability]\n    B -->|User Needs| E[Holistic Design]\n    C -->|Technical Limits| E\n    D -->|Business Goals| E\n    style E fill:#f66,stroke:#333\n```\n\n#### **Graph 3: Prototyping Types & Goals**\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n    A[Prototyping] --> B[Low-Fidelity]\n    A --> C[High-Fidelity]\n    B -->|Goal: Brainstorming| D[Paper Sketches]\n    B -->|Goal: Quick Iteration| E[Wireframes]\n    C -->|Goal: Usability Testing| F[Interactive Digital Models]\n    style B fill:#f96,stroke:#333\n    style C fill:#6f9,stroke:#333\n```\n\n#### **Graph 4: UX vs. Marketing Objectives**\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n    A[Designers] -->|Create| B[User-Centric Solutions]\n    C[Marketers] -->|Sell| D[Drive Engagement]\n    B -->|Aligns With| D\n    style B fill:#bbf,stroke:#333\n    style D fill:#f96,stroke:#333\n```\n\n#### **Graph 5: Conflict Resolution in Design**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Deadlock in Ideation] --> B[Revisit Problem Statement]\n    A --> C[Prototype Both Solutions]\n    B --> D[Clarify User Needs]\n    C --> D\n    D --> E[Test & Iterate]\n    style E fill:#9cf,stroke:#333\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Exam Tips**\n1. **Section A (15 Marks)**:\n   - **Structure**: Follow the 6-step template (personas \u2192 root cause \u2192 prototypes \u2192 iteration).\n   - **Time Management**: Spend **5 mins/step** (30 mins total).\n   - **Visuals**: Sketch **2-3 wireframes** (even rough) for full marks.\n2. **Section B (25 Marks)**:\n   - **MCQs**: Focus on **definitions** (e.g., ASO, TRIZ) and **processes** (e.g., Agile, prototyping).\n   - **Caselets**: Apply **user-centric logic** (e.g., GroceriesGo \u2192 prioritize **convenience** over aesthetics).\n3. **Common Pitfalls**:\n   - **Over-engineering prototypes**: Low-fi should be **simple** (not polished).\n   - **Ignoring feasibility**: Balance creativity with **technical/business constraints**.\n   - **Misapplying TRIZ**: Match principles to **physical attributes** (e.g., **Segmenting** = collapsible objects).",
