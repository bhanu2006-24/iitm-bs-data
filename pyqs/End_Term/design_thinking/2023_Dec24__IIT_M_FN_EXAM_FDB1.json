Instructions: Step 0: Ensure that you write the problem statement and question number clearly on the answer sheet. Step 1: Allocate one or two pages to personas, journey maps, and a list of problems. Step 2:Dedicate one page to identifying the root cause. Step 3: Allocate one page to identify desired results and summarize 2 to 3 'problem questions' to solve. Step 4: List the ideas in 50 words (not exceeding 5 sentences/ 5 ideas), in one page. Step 5: Sketch 2-3 wireframes of the product/service/app you will be developing, in one page. Step 6: Summarize how you'll iterate and what you\u2019ll do for customers in the future to improve or expand upon the solution, in one page.  The suggested time for this question is 30 minutes.

Begin by empathizing, developing a persona, and mapping out the user journey to identify problems. Analyze by determining the root cause and reasons for addressing the issues. Progress to the Solve phase by fleshing out ideas and creating low-fi wireframes/sketches on paper. Finally, demonstrate how your ideas address the problem and propose improvements.  Instructions: Step 0: Ensure that you write the problem statement and question number clearly on the answer sheet. Step 1: Allocate one or two pages to personas, journey maps, and a list of problems. Step 2:Dedicate one page to identifying the root cause. Step 3: Allocate one page to identify desired results and summarize 2 to 3 'problem questions' to solve. Step 4: List the ideas in 50 words (not exceeding 5 sentences/ 5 ideas), in one page. Step 5: Sketch 2-3 wireframes of the product/service/app you will be developing, in one page. Step 6: Summarize how you'll iterate and what you\u2019ll do for customers in the future to improve or expand upon the solution, in one page.  The suggested time for this question is 30 minutes. You may use the given sheets in portrait or landscape mode. Do not exceed more than 8 pages to answer the question.  CHOOSE AND ATTEMPT ONLY ONE QUESTION. Write the problem statement and question number clearly on the answer sheet. The suggested time for this question is 30 minutes.  1. A. Your customer is a hotel industry worker. They face challenges at work as well as in their personal life. There exist worries like managing guest requests efficiently while maintaining service quality. The worker often struggles with multiple tasks, leading to potential errors and delays, affecting customer satisfaction. Also, the work days extend over long hours causing fatigue and physical and mental stress, which have their consequences.  OR   1. B. Stop unwanted subscription fees: It\u2019s hard to keep track of all the products and services that we have subscribed to every month. All we see is money deducted from our accounts, sometimes from services that we don\u2019t need anymore. How can you design a product/ service which helps manage subscriptions?"

        "summary": "Here\u2019s a structured **summary of core topics, concepts, and principles** for the **Design Thinking** exam, followed by **Mermaid knowledge graphs** to visualize relationships.\n\n---\n\n### **Core Topics & Key Concepts**\n#### **1. Design Thinking Process**\n- **Phases**:\n  1. **Empathize**: Understand user needs (personas, journey maps, empathy gap).\n  2. **Define**: Root cause analysis, problem statements (\"How Might We\" questions).\n  3. **Ideate**: Brainstorming (silent brainstorming, inventive triggers), low-fi prototyping.\n  4. **Prototype**: Rapid prototyping (digital/physical), wireframes, user testing.\n  5. **Test**: Iteration, feedback loops, bulletproofing ideas (feasibility/desirability).\n- **Key Tools**:\n  - **Personas**: Fictional user profiles.\n  - **Journey Maps**: Visualize user interactions/pain points.\n  - **Wireframes**: Low-fidelity sketches of interfaces.\n  - **How Might We (HMW)**: Open-ended problem reframing (e.g., *\"How might we reduce subscription clutter?\"*).\n\n#### **2. User-Centric Design**\n- **Empathy Gap**: Discrepancy between designer assumptions and real user experiences.\n- **Fly on the Wall**: Observational research (vs. interviews) for unbiased insights.\n- **Holistic Design**: Balancing user needs, business viability, and technical feasibility.\n\n#### **3. Prototyping & Iteration**\n- **Low-Fidelity Prototypes**: Quick, rough models (paper sketches, digital mockups) to **brainstorm ideas** (not final designs).\n- **Rapid Prototyping**: Test sizing options (e.g., digital simulations for clothing).\n- **Bulletproofing**: Stress-test ideas for **feasibility, desirability, adaptability**.\n\n#### **4. Innovation Principles**\n- **Three Pillars of Innovation**:\n  1. **Desirability** (user needs),\n  2. **Feasibility** (technical/operational),\n  3. **Viability** (business sustainability).\n- **System Seeking**: Identifying patterns/connections in larger systems (e.g., subscription ecosystems).\n- **Intrapreneurship vs. Crowdsourcing**:\n  - **Intrapreneurship**: Internal innovation (employees driving change).\n  - **Crowdsourcing**: External input (e.g., user feedback, open ideation).\n\n#### **5. Digital Marketing & App Growth**\n- **App Store Optimization (ASO)**: Improve visibility in app stores (keywords, visuals, reviews).\n- **Google App Campaigns (UAC)**: Machine learning-driven ad targeting.\n- **Referral Marketing**: Leverage social proof (e.g., testimonials, incentives for sharing).\n- **Mobile-Friendly Design**: Responsive web design (adapts to device size).\n\n#### **6. Conflict & Stakeholder Balance**\n- **Personal vs. Professional Conflicts**: Analyze intersections (e.g., Tony Stark\u2019s arc in MCU).\n- **Holistic Design**: Balance diverse stakeholder interests (users, business, tech).\n\n#### **7. Agile & Project Management**\n- **Agile Methodologies**: Iterative development with **user feedback**.\n- **Projects vs. Operations**:\n  - Projects: **Temporary**, goal-specific (e.g., redesigning an app).\n  - Operations: **Ongoing** (e.g., daily customer support).\n\n---\n\n### **Key Equations/Frameworks (Non-Math)**\n1. **Design Thinking Formula**:\n   `Empathize \u2192 Define \u2192 Ideate \u2192 Prototype \u2192 Test` (Iterative loop).\n2. **Innovation Success**:\n   `Desirability + Feasibility + Viability = Sustainable Solution`.\n3. **HMW Question Template**:\n   *\"How might we [action] [user need] without [constraint]?\"*\n   Example: *\"How might we track subscriptions without manual input?\"*\n\n---\n\n### **Mermaid Knowledge Graphs**\n#### **Graph 1: Design Thinking Process Flow**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Empathize] -->|Personas/Journey Maps| B[Define]\n    B -->|Root Cause/HMW| C[Ideate]\n    C -->|Brainstorming| D[Prototype]\n    D -->|Low-Fi Wireframes| E[Test]\n    E -->|User Feedback| A\n    style A fill:#f9f,stroke:#333\n    style B fill:#bbf,stroke:#333\n    style C fill:#f96,stroke:#333\n    style D fill:#6f9,stroke:#333\n    style E fill:#9cf,stroke:#333\n```\n\n#### **Graph 2: Innovation Pillars & Stakeholder Balance**\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n    subgraph Innovation\n        D[Desirability: User Needs] --> F[Feasibility: Tech/Operations]\n        F --> V[Viability: Business Model]\n        V --> D\n    end\n    subgraph Stakeholders\n        U[Users] -->|Feedback| D\n        B[Business] -->|Goals| V\n        T[Tech Team] -->|Constraints| F\n    end\n    style D fill:#f96,stroke:#333\n    style F fill:#6f9,stroke:#333\n    style V fill:#9cf,stroke:#333\n```\n\n#### **Graph 3: Prototyping & Testing Relationships**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    P[Low-Fi Prototype] -->|Quick Iteration| T[User Testing]\n    T -->|Feedback| I[Ideas Refinement]\n    I -->|Bulletproofing| P2[High-Fi Prototype]\n    P2 -->|Validation| L[Launch]\n    style P fill:#f96,stroke:#333\n    style T fill:#6f9,stroke:#333\n    style I fill:#bbf,stroke:#333\n```\n\n#### **Graph 4: Digital Marketing Ecosystem**\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n    ASO[App Store Optimization] -->|Visibility| UAC[Google App Campaigns]\n    UAC -->|ML Targeting| RM[Referral Marketing]\n    RM -->|Social Proof| ASO\n    click ASO \"#app-store-optimization\" \"Improve app store rankings\"\n    click UAC \"#google-app-campaigns\" \"Machine learning ads\"\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Exam Tips**\n1. **Section A (Case Study)**:\n   - **Structure**: Follow the 6-step template (empathize \u2192 define \u2192 ideate \u2192 prototype \u2192 test \u2192 iterate).\n   - **Wireframes**: Sketch **2\u20133 simple layouts** (e.g., subscription tracker dashboard).\n   - **Root Cause**: Use **\"5 Whys\"** to drill down (e.g., *\"Why do users forget subscriptions?\" \u2192 \"No centralized tracking\"*).\n\n2. **Section B (MCQs)**:\n   - **Key Themes**:\n     - **Empathy Gap** (Q14) = Designer assumptions vs. real user needs.\n     - **HMW Questions** (Q13) = Open-ended, user-focused.\n     - **Prototyping** (Q10, Q18) = Low-fi for iteration, not final product.\n     - **Innovation Pillars** (Q24) = Desirability + Feasibility + Viability.\n   - **Tricky Questions**:\n     - Q15: Overemphasis on **feasibility** \u2192 **limits innovation** (stifles radical ideas).\n     - Q17: **Second iteration ideation** \u2192 Use **silent brainstorming + triggers**.\n\n3. **Common Pitfalls**:\n   - Confusing **sympathy** (pity) with **empathy** (understanding).\n   - Assuming **high-fi prototypes** are for early testing (they\u2019re not; use low-fi first).\n   - Ignoring **business viability** in user-centric designs.",
