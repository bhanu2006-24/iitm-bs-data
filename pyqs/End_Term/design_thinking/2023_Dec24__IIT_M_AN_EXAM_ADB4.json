        "summary": "Here\u2019s a structured **summary of core topics, concepts, and principles** for the **Design Thinking** exam, along with **Mermaid knowledge graphs** to visualize relationships.\n\n---\n\n---\n\n### **Core Topics & Concepts**\n#### **1. Design Thinking Process**\n- **Phases**:\n  1. **Empathize**: Understand user needs (personas, journey maps, \"Fly on the Wall\" technique).\n  2. **Define**: Root cause analysis, problem statements (e.g., \"How Might We...\" questions).\n  3. **Ideate**: Brainstorming, silent brainstorming, inventive solution triggers (e.g., TRIZ principles).\n  4. **Prototype**: Low-fidelity (paper sketches) vs. high-fidelity prototypes; rapid prototyping.\n  5. **Test**: Iterate based on user feedback.\n- **Key Tools**:\n  - **Personas**: Fictional user profiles.\n  - **User Journey Maps**: Visualize user interactions and pain points.\n  - **Wireframes**: Basic layouts for apps/websites.\n  - **TRIZ Principles**: Systematic innovation (e.g., \"Segmenting\" for collapsible designs).\n\n#### **2. Innovation & Problem-Solving**\n- **Three Pillars of Innovation**:\n  - **Desirability** (user needs),\n  - **Feasibility** (technical/operational possibility),\n  - **Viability** (business sustainability).\n- **Balancing Constraints**:\n  - Overemphasizing feasibility \u2192 limits creativity (e.g., incremental vs. radical ideas).\n  - **Holistic Design**: Balance stakeholder interests (users, business, tech).\n- **Serendipity in Innovation**: Unforeseen challenges (e.g., Shivanasamudra power plant case).\n\n#### **3. Prototyping & Testing**\n- **Low-Fidelity Prototypes**:\n  - Goal: Quick iteration, not visual polish.\n  - Tools: Paper sketches, digital mockups (e.g., Figma).\n- **Rapid Prototyping**:\n  - Example: Digital sizing simulations for clothing retailers.\n- **Bulletproofing Ideas**:\n  - Evaluate feasibility, desirability, and adaptability.\n\n#### **4. User-Centric Design (UX)**\n- **UX Frameworks**:\n  - Focus on user problems, iteration, and user feedback.\n  - **Not** about profit maximization (Option D in Q9 is incorrect).\n- **Responsive Design**:\n  - Adapts to device size (not connection speed or user type).\n- **ASO (App Store Optimization)**:\n  - Improve visibility in app stores (keywords, visuals, metadata).\n- **Google App Campaigns (UAC)**:\n  - Uses **machine learning** for audience targeting (vs. traditional ads).\n\n#### **5. Agile & Collaboration**\n- **Agile Methodologies**:\n  - Iterative development with **user feedback loops**.\n- **Conflict Resolution**:\n  - Revisit problem statements or prototype competing ideas (not voting).\n- **Intrapreneurship vs. Crowdsourcing**:\n  - Crowdsourcing can **support** intrapreneurship (e.g., idea generation).\n\n#### **6. Marketing & Business Alignment**\n- **Designers vs. Marketers**:\n  - Designers: **Create** solutions.\n  - Marketers: **Sell and drive usage**.\n- **Digital Marketing Checklist**:\n  - Plan campaigns for **awareness and engagement** (not legal compliance).\n- **Brand Recall**:\n  - Competitive advantage by occupying **mental space** (e.g., \"Think Different\" for Apple).\n\n#### **7. TRIZ Principles (Example-Based)**\n| Principle       | Example                          | Application                     |\n|-----------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| **Segmenting**  | Collapsible water bottle         | Foldable designs                |\n| **Nested Dolls**| Telescoping antenna              | Compact storage                 |\n| **Universality**| Multi-tool (e.g., Swiss Army)    | Single device for multiple uses |\n\n#### **8. Case Studies**\n- **GroceriesGo App**:\n  - **Primary Focus**: Clear navigation + concise info (busy professionals).\n  - **CTA**: \"Get GroceriesGo Now\" (direct action).\n- **Mindfulness App for Students**:\n  - Design a **single detail view** (e.g., meditation timer + progress tracker).\n\n---\n\n---\n\n### **Key Equations/Frameworks (Non-Math)**\n1. **Design Thinking Formula**:\n   ```\n   Empathize \u2192 Define \u2192 Ideate \u2192 Prototype \u2192 Test (Iterate)\n   ```\n2. **Innovation Success**:\n   ```\n   Success = Desirability \u00d7 Feasibility \u00d7 Viability\n   ```\n3. **TRIZ Contradiction Matrix** (Simplified):\n   - Identify **technical contradictions** (e.g., \"I want a bottle that holds more but takes less space\") \u2192 Apply principles like **Segmenting**.\n\n---\n\n---\n\n### **Mermaid Knowledge Graphs**\n#### **Graph 1: Design Thinking Process Flow**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Empathize] -->|Personas/Journey Maps| B[Define]\n    B -->|Problem Statements| C[Ideate]\n    C -->|Brainstorming/TRIZ| D[Prototype]\n    D -->|Low-Fi/High-Fi| E[Test]\n    E -->|User Feedback| C\n    style A fill:#f9f,stroke:#333\n    style B fill:#bbf,stroke:#333\n    style C fill:#f96,stroke:#333\n    style D fill:#6f9,stroke:#333\n    style E fill:#9f6,stroke:#333\n```\n\n#### **Graph 2: Innovation Pillars & Stakeholders**\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n    U[User Desirability] -->|Needs| I[Innovation]\n    T[Technical Feasibility] -->|Constraints| I\n    B[Business Viability] -->|Sustainability| I\n    I -->|Holistic Design| S[Solution]\n    S -->|Balances| U\n    S -->|Balances| T\n    S -->|Balances| B\n```\n\n#### **Graph 3: Prototyping & Testing Relationship**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    P[Prototype] -->|Low-Fi| T[Test]\n    P -->|High-Fi| T\n    T -->|Feedback| I[Iterate]\n    I -->|Improve| P\n    style P fill:#f96,stroke:#333\n    style T fill:#9f6,stroke:#333\n```\n\n#### **Graph 4: TRIZ Principles Hierarchy**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    TRIZ[TRIZ Principles] --> S[Segmenting]\n    TRIZ --> N[Nested Dolls]\n    TRIZ --> U[Universality]\n    S -->|Example| C[Collapsible Bottle]\n    N -->|Example| T[Telescoping Antenna]\n    U -->|Example| M[Multi-Tool]\n```\n\n#### **Graph 5: Agile vs. Traditional Development**\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n    A[Agile] -->|Iterative| F[User Feedback]\n    A -->|Flexible| S[Sprints]\n    T[Traditional] -->|Linear| P[Planned Phases]\n    T -->|Rigid| D[Documentation]\n    F -->|Informs| A\n```\n\n---\n\n---\n\n### **Exam Tips**\n1. **Section A (15 Marks)**:\n   - **Structure**: Follow the 6-step template (personas \u2192 root cause \u2192 wireframes \u2192 iteration).\n   - **Time Management**: Spend ~5 mins per step (30 mins total).\n   - **Visuals**: Sketch **2-3 wireframes** (even if rough).\n   - **Example**: For the **healthcare worker** question, focus on:\n     - **Empathize**: Burnout, time constraints.\n     - **Define**: \"How might we reduce administrative burden?\"\n     - **Ideate**: App for task prioritization + mental health resources.\n     - **Prototype**: Dashboard with patient queue + break reminders.\n\n2. **Section B (25 Marks)**:\n   - **Key Themes**:\n     - **UX/UI**: Low-fi prototypes, responsive design.\n     - **Innovation**: TRIZ, holistic design, serendipity.\n     - **Marketing**: ASO, brand recall, CTAs.\n   - **Tricky Questions**:\n     - Q14 (TRIZ): Collapsible bottle = **Segmenting**.\n     - Q15: Feasibility overemphasis \u2192 **limits radical ideas**.\n     - Q24: **Three pillars** = Desirability, Feasibility, Viability.\n\n3. **Avoid Pitfalls**:\n   - **Not**: Voting to resolve deadlocks (Q13 \u2192 **prototype both**).\n   - **Not**: High-fidelity prototypes for early iteration (Q10 \u2192 **low-fi**).\n   - **Not**: Ignoring stakeholder balance (Q21 \u2192 **holistic design**).",
