The spider cam is itself a powerful ARM-based computer which has connectivity to the Cloud, an all-seeing AI-powered superbeing, through the wire on which it hangs. Using this connectivity, it can send as much or as little data as required and also receive instructions from the cloud. Your task is to design the data pipeline that enables such feedback to the fielder for every ball that comes his way with as much accuracy as possible throughout the match. You are given two ML models: a vision model that given a frame from the spider cam computes an alert if the ball is headed to him, and an adjustment model that helps adjust catch positioning of the fielder which takes as input a continuous video feed. Which of the following options best satisfies the requirements?"

Your management has now instructed you to reduce the cost of AI projects significantly, and has given guidance that latency of execution is not a concern since the consumer for the model output is batch oriented, and also that they would be ok with a lesser recall rate provided the drop isn\u2019t significant.

        "summary": "Here\u2019s a structured summary of the **core topics, concepts, principles, and equations** essential for the **\"Introduction to Big Data\"** exam, along with **Mermaid knowledge graphs** to visualize relationships.\n\n---\n\n---\n\n### **Core Topics & Concepts**\n#### **1.

Distributed Computing Frameworks**\n   - **Hadoop Ecosystem**:\n     - **HDFS**: Distributed file system for storing large datasets.\n     - **MapReduce**: Batch processing paradigm (Map \u2192 Shuffle \u2192 Reduce).\n     - **YARN**: Resource manager (not a divide-and-conquer framework).\n   - **Apache Spark**:\n     - **RDDs**: Resilient Distributed Datasets (immutable, fault-tolerant).\n     - **DataFrames/Datasets**: Optimized for structured data (Catalyst optimizer).\n     - **Spark Streaming**: Micro-batch processing (DStreams) or continuous (Structured Streaming).\n     - **Spark SQL**: SQL-like queries on distributed data.\n     - **MLlib**: Machine learning library.\n   - **Key Differences (MapReduce vs. Spark)**:\n     | Feature               | MapReduce                          | Spark                              |\n     |-----------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n     | **Processing Model**  | Batch-only                         | Batch, Streaming, ML, Graph        |\n     | **Memory Usage**      | Disk-based (slow)                  | In-memory (fast)                   |\n     | **Execution Model**   | Rigid (Map \u2192 Reduce)               | DAG (flexible operations)          |\n     | **Fault Tolerance**    | Re-executes tasks                  | Lineage-based recovery             |\n     | **Latency**           | High (minutes/hours)               | Low (seconds)                      |\n\n#### **3. Data Processing Paradigms**\n   - **Divide-and-Conquer**:\n     - Split data into chunks, process in parallel, and combine results.\n     - Examples: MapReduce, Spark, Hive, PySpark, Spark MLlib.\n     - **Not YARN** (it\u2019s a resource manager, not a processing paradigm).\n   - **ETL vs. ELT**:\n     - **ETL**: Extract \u2192 Transform \u2192 Load (traditional, bottleneck on transformation).\n     - **ELT**: Extract \u2192 Load \u2192 Transform (modern, leverages distributed compute).\n   - **Hot Potato Principle**:\n     - Minimize work per processing step for **scalability** and **recoverability**.\n     - Avoid heavy computations in intermediate steps (e.g., use lightweight transforms).\n     - **Not dependent on a message store** (Option D in Q2 is false).\n\n#### **4. Streaming Systems**\n   - **Kafka**:\n     - Distributed event streaming platform (publish-subscribe model).\n     - **Partitions**: Enable parallel consumption (scaling consumers).\n     - **Offsets**: Track progress of consumers.\n     - **Scaling**:\n       - Add **brokers** (not just disks or partitions) to handle higher throughput.\n       - Increasing partitions helps but requires consumer rebalancing.\n   - **Stream Processing Semantics**:\n     - **At-least-once**: Guarantees no data loss but may have duplicates.\n     - **At-most-once**: No duplicates but may lose data.\n     - **Exactly-once**: No loss or duplicates (requires idempotent sinks/transactions).\n   - **Structured Streaming (Spark)**:\n     - Micro-batch processing with **exactly-once** guarantees (via checkpointing).\n     - Supports **stateful operations** (e.g., windowed aggregations).\n     - **Failure Recovery**: Retries failed batches without visible side effects to consumers.\n\n#### **5. Cloud-Native Design**\n   - **Principles**:\n     - **Scalability**: Auto-scaling (e.g., Kubernetes, serverless).\n     - **Resilience**: Self-healing (e.g., retries, circuit breakers).\n     - **Observability**: Metrics, logs, traces (e.g., Prometheus, Kafka monitoring).\n     - **Manageability**: Declarative configs (e.g., Terraform, Helm).\n   - **Serverless**:\n     - **Google Cloud Functions**: Event-driven, auto-scaling (ideal for low-maintenance pipelines).\n     - **Dataproc**: Managed Hadoop/Spark (for batch/streaming).\n     - **Dataflow**: Fully managed stream/batch processing (Apache Beam).\n\n#### **6. Data Storage & Formats**\n   - **File Formats**:\n     - **CSV/JSON**: Human-readable but slow for big data.\n     - **Parquet/ORC**: Columnar storage (optimized for analytics).\n   - **Databases**:\n     - **OLTP**: MongoDB (transactional, row-based).\n     - **OLAP**: Hadoop/Hive (analytical, columnar).\n     - **NoSQL**: Redis (key-value, low-latency reads).\n   - **Data Lakes**:\n     - Centralized repository (e.g., HDFS, GCS, S3) for raw and processed data.\n\n#### **7. Performance Optimization**\n   - **Broadcast Variables (Spark)**:\n     - Cache small datasets (e.g., 1MB file) on all workers to avoid shuffling.\n   - **Partitioning**:\n     - Distribute data evenly to avoid skew (e.g., `repartition` in Spark).\n   - **Caching**:\n     - Persist intermediate RDDs/DataFrames in memory (`cache()` or `persist()`).\n   - **Avoid Driver Bottlenecks**:\n     - Push transformations to workers (e.g., filter early, avoid `collect()`).\n\n#### **8. Machine Learning in Big Data**\n   - **Deep Learning Models**:\n     - **Model Loading**: Avoid repeated loads (e.g., use singleton patterns or Spark\u2019s `mapPartitions`).\n     - **Trade-offs**:\n       - **GPU vs. CPU**: GPUs for low-latency, CPUs for cost savings.\n       - **Model Size**: Smaller models (e.g., MobileNet) reduce resource usage.\n   - **ML Pipelines**:\n     - **Spark MLlib**: Distributed training/inference.\n     - **TensorFlow/PyTorch on Spark**: For deep learning at scale.\n\n#### **9. Time Handling in Data Pipelines**\n   - **Event Time vs. Processing Time**:\n     - **Event Time**: When the event occurred (e.g., transaction timestamp).\n     - **Processing Time**: When the system processes the event.\n   - **Business Time**:\n     - Aligns with organizational schedules (e.g., weekly sales reports).\n     - **Time Zone Changes**: Require rewriting pipelines if business logic depends on local time (e.g., Q10).\n\n#### **10. Data Pipeline Design**\n   - **Lambda Architecture**:\n     - **Batch Layer**: Hadoop/MapReduce (historical data).\n     - **Speed Layer**: Spark Streaming (real-time).\n     - **Serving Layer**: Merge results for queries.\n   - **Kappa Architecture**:\n     - Stream-only (e.g., Kafka + Spark Streaming).\n   - **Edge Computing**:\n     - Process data near the source (e.g., spider cam in Q12) to reduce latency.\n\n#### **11. Fault Tolerance & Recovery**\n   - **Checkpointing**: Save state periodically (e.g., Spark Streaming).\n   - **Idempotent Operations**: Ensure retries don\u2019t cause duplicates.\n   - **Logging**:\n     - Debug logs should not affect consumer visibility (e.g., Q15).\n\n---\n\n### **Key Equations (Mathematics/Performance)**\n1. **MapReduce WordCount Example**:\n   - **Map**: `(key, value) \u2192 [(word, 1)]`\n   - **Reduce**: `(word, [1, 1, 1]) \u2192 (word, 3)`\n\n2. **Spark Aggregation**:\n   ```python\n   df.groupBy(\"IP\").agg(count(\"*\").alias(\"hits\"))\n   ```\n\n3. **Kafka Throughput**:\n   - `Throughput = (Partitions \u00d7 Replication Factor) / (Producer + Consumer Latency)`\n\n4. **Spark Parallelism**:\n   - `Optimal Partitions = (Total Data Size) / (Target Partition Size: 128MB\u20131GB)`\n\n5. **Streaming Lag**:\n   - `Lag = (Event Time - Processing Time)`\n\n---\n\n### **Mermaid Knowledge Graphs**\n#### **Graph 1: Big Data Ecosystem Relationships**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Big Data] --> B[Batch Processing]\n    A --> C[Stream Processing]\n    B --> D[MapReduce]\n    B --> E[Hive]\n    C --> F[Spark Streaming]\n    C --> G[Kafka]\n    D --> H[HDFS]\n    E --> H\n    F --> I[Structured Streaming]\n    G --> J[Producers/Consumers]\n    I --> K[Exactly-Once Semantics]\n```\n\n#### **Graph 2: Spark vs. MapReduce**\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n    A[MapReduce] -->|Disk-Based| B[High Latency]\n    A -->|Rigid: Map-Reduce| C[Limited Flexibility]\n    D[Spark] -->|In-Memory| E[Low Latency]\n    D -->|DAG| F[Flexible Operations]\n    D --> G[MLlib]\n    D --> H[Streaming]\n```\n\n#### **Graph 3: Streaming Semantics**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Stream Processing] --> B[At-Least-Once]\n    A --> C[At-Most-Once]\n    A --> D[Exactly-Once]\n    B --> E[Duplicates Possible]\n    C --> F[Data Loss Possible]\n    D --> G[Checkpointing]\n    D --> H[Idempotent Sinks]\n```\n\n#### **Graph 4: Cloud-Native Design**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Cloud-Native] --> B[Scalability]\n    A --> C[Resilience]\n    A --> D[Observability]\n    A --> E[Manageability]\n    B --> F[Auto-Scaling]\n    C --> G[Self-Healing]\n    D --> H[Logging/Metrics]\n    E --> I[Declarative Configs]\n```\n\n#### **Graph 5: Data Pipeline Components**\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n    A[Data Source] --> B[Ingestion]\n    B --> C[Storage: HDFS/GCS]\n    C --> D[Processing: Spark/MapReduce]\n    D --> E[Serving: DB/Dashboard]\n    D --> F[ML: Training/Inference]\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Exam Tips**\n1. **Spark Optimization**:\n   - Use `broadcast` for small datasets, avoid `collect()`, and leverage DataFrames.\n2. **Kafka Scaling**:\n   - Add brokers (not just partitions) to handle throughput.\n3. **Fault Tolerance**:\n   - Structured Streaming provides exactly-once guarantees via checkpoints.\n4. **Cloud-Native**:\n   - Serverless (e.g., Cloud Functions) reduces administrative overhead.\n5. **Time Handling**:\n   - Business time changes (e.g., weekends) require pipeline rewrites.\n6. **ETL vs. ELT**:\n   - Push transformations to distributed systems (ELT) for scalability.",
