                        "In the class, we saw the UDF for mobilenet_v2. By definition, UDFs are scalar. In Spark, there is another class of user defined routines called UDAFs, which stand for User Defined Aggregator Functions. UDAFs are meant to provide a means to write a custom aggregation function which aggregates over a grouping of values to arrive at a single value. UDAF structure differs saliently from UDFs in that it exposes the notion of a buffer as a way of maintaining intermediate state before finalizing aggregate output. Why is a buffer required for UDAF and not for a UDF?"

However, your management has instructed you to reduce the cost of AI projects significantly.

Consider also that apart from the functional logic, the same application is also emitting into a file the start time and end time of every batch invocation for audit purposes.  Assume there is a failure in one of the Dataproc machines that results in a failure of a specific run. For the external world (i.e. anybody consuming the outputs of this application), will they see any change in output as a result of the failure at all, or will the only impact of failure be one of slower performance for the failed-and-retried run? select the one from the list below that answer this question."

The business head at IRCTC is interested in a real-time view of all of her stations irrespective of whether there were bookings or not. She wants to see this be presented in a monitor mounted in her office wall that refreshes with the latest info on an India map every 1 minute along with the time of update so that she gets the confirmation that this is the latest data, so that she can plan for new summer-special trains as required.
