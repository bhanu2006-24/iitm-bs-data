                        "Consider a Structured Streaming application running on Google Dataproc firing up every 10 seconds, consuming any number of records from Kafka available since last read, and emitting some computed answers to another Kafka topic. Consider also that apart from the functional logic, the same application is also emitting into a file the start time and end time of every batch invocation for audit purposes.  Assume there is a failure in one of the Dataproc machines that results in a failure of a specific run. For the external world (i.e. anybody consuming the outputs of this application), will they see any change in output as a result of the failure at all, or will the only visible impact of failure be of slower performance for the failed-and-retried run?"

        "summary": "Here\u2019s a structured **summary of core topics, concepts, principles, and equations** essential for the **\"Introduction to Big Data\"** exam, followed by **Mermaid knowledge graphs** to visualize relationships.\n\n---\n\n---\n\n### **Core Topics & Concepts**\n#### **1. Big Data Fundamentals**\n- **Definition**: High-volume, high-velocity, and/or high-variety data requiring distributed processing.\n- **4 Vs of Big Data**: Volume, Velocity, Variety, Veracity.\n- **Batch vs. Stream Processing**:\n  - **Batch**: Processes finite datasets (e.g., Hadoop MapReduce, Spark batch).\n  - **Stream**: Processes infinite/unbounded data in real-time (e.g., Spark Streaming, Kafka Streams).\n- **Divide-and-Conquer Paradigm**: Splitting problems into smaller subproblems (e.g., MapReduce, Spark).\n\n#### **2. Distributed Systems & Frameworks**\n- **Hadoop**:\n  - **HDFS**: Distributed file system for storing large datasets.\n  - **MapReduce**: Batch processing model (Map \u2192 Shuffle \u2192 Reduce).\n  - **YARN**: Resource manager for Hadoop clusters.\n- **Spark**:\n  - **RDDs (Resilient Distributed Datasets)**: Immutable, partitioned collections.\n  - **DataFrames/Datasets**: Optimized tabular data structures with Catalyst optimizer.\n  - **Spark SQL**: SQL-like queries on distributed data.\n  - **Structured Streaming**: Micro-batch stream processing with exactly-once semantics.\n  - **Spark vs. MapReduce**:\n    - Spark uses **DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs)** for parallel execution (no barrier synchronization).\n    - Spark optimizes for **in-memory computation** (MapReduce uses disk).\n- **Flink**: Alternative to Spark for low-latency streaming (not covered in depth here).\n\n#### **3. Data Processing Models**\n- **Hot Potato Principle** (Stream Processing):\n  - Minimal processing per stage; pass intermediate results to the next stage via a message store (e.g., Kafka).\n  - Avoids monolithic processing.\n- **Lambda Architecture**:\n  - **Batch Layer**: Pre-computes views (e.g., Hadoop).\n  - **Speed Layer**: Real-time processing (e.g., Spark Streaming).\n  - **Serving Layer**: Merges batch and real-time results.\n- **Kappa Architecture**: Simplifies Lambda by using only streaming (e.g., Kafka + Spark Streaming).\n\n#### **4. Message Brokers & Event Streaming**\n- **Kafka**:\n  - **Topics/Partitions**: Logs for storing streams of records.\n  - **Producers/Consumers**: Publish/subscribe model.\n  - **Brokers**: Servers storing topic data.\n  - **Replication**: Ensures fault tolerance (e.g., `replication.factor=2`).\n  - **Offsets**: Track consumer progress.\n  - **Exactly-Once Semantics**: Idempotent producers + transactional writes.\n- **Pub/Sub**: Google\u2019s managed message queue (similar to Kafka but serverless).\n\n#### **5. Cloud-Native Big Data**\n- **Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Services**:\n  - **Dataproc**: Managed Spark/Hadoop.\n  - **Dataflow**: Managed Flink/Beam for streaming/batch.\n  - **BigQuery**: Serverless data warehouse.\n  - **Cloud Functions**: Serverless event-driven compute.\n  - **Datastore/Firestore**: NoSQL databases.\n  - **GCS (Google Cloud Storage)**: Object storage for data lakes.\n- **Serverless vs. Managed Services**:\n  - **IaaS**: VMs, self-managed clusters (e.g., Hadoop on GCP VMs).\n  - **PaaS**: Managed services (e.g., Dataproc, Dataflow).\n- **Cloud-Native Principles**:\n  - **Resilience**: Auto-recovery from failures (e.g., Kafka replication, Spark checkpointing).\n  - **Observability**: Logging/metrics (e.g., Spark UI, Prometheus).\n  - **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling (e.g., adding Kafka brokers, Spark executors).\n\n#### **6. Performance Optimization**\n- **Partitioning**:\n  - **Kafka**: Increase partitions for parallelism (but avoid too many small partitions).\n  - **Spark**: Use `repartition()` or `coalesce()` to balance data across executors.\n- **Broadcast Variables**: Share small datasets (e.g., lookup tables) efficiently across workers.\n- **Caching/Persisting**: Reuse RDDs/DataFrames in memory (`cache()`, `persist()`).\n- **Join Optimizations**:\n  - **Broadcast Join**: For small tables (avoid shuffles).\n  - **Bucketing**: Pre-partition tables by join keys.\n- **Cost-Based Optimizer (CBO)**: Use `ANALYZE TABLE` to update statistics for Spark SQL.\n- **Resource Allocation**: Tune executor memory/cores (`spark.executor.memory`).\n\n#### **7. Data Serialization & Storage**\n- **File Formats**:\n  - **Parquet/ORC**: Columnar storage for analytics.\n  - **Avro**: Row-based with schema evolution.\n  - **JSON/CSV**: Human-readable but less efficient.\n- **Data Lakes**: Centralized repositories (e.g., GCS + Hive metastore).\n- **Data Warehouses**: Structured storage for SQL (e.g., BigQuery, Snowflake).\n\n#### **8. Fault Tolerance & Recovery**\n- **Checkpointing**: Save state in Spark Streaming/Flink to recover from failures.\n- **Kafka Consumer Groups**: Track offsets to resume from last read position.\n- **Idempotent Operations**: Ensure retries don\u2019t duplicate side effects (e.g., Kafka transactions).\n\n#### **9. Real-Time Analytics & Dashboards**\n- **Output Modes in Spark Streaming**:\n  - **Append**: Only new results.\n  - **Complete**: Full aggregated table (for stateful operations).\n  - **Update**: Only changed rows.\n- **Watermarking**: Handle late data in streaming (e.g., `withWatermark()`).\n- **Window Functions**: Tumbling/sliding windows for aggregations (e.g., `window(timeColumn, \"5 minutes\")`).\n\n#### **10. Machine Learning in Big Data**\n- **MLlib**: Spark\u2019s distributed ML library.\n- **Model Serving**:\n  - **Edge Deployment**: Run models on devices (e.g., spider cam in Q13).\n  - **Cloud ML**: Train/deploy models (e.g., Google Vertex AI).\n- **UDFs vs. UDAFs**:\n  - **UDF (User-Defined Function)**: Scalar operations (1 row \u2192 1 output).\n  - **UDAF (User-Defined Aggregate Function)**: Aggregations (multiple rows \u2192 1 output; requires intermediate buffers).\n\n#### **11. Data Governance & Best Practices**\n- **Schema Evolution**: Handle changes in data structure (e.g., Avro schemas).\n- **Data Quality**: Validate/clean data (e.g., Spark\u2019s `DataFrameNaFunctions`).\n- **Security**: Encryption, IAM roles (e.g., GCP service accounts).\n- **Hot Potato Principle**: Minimize per-stage processing in streams.\n\n---\n\n---\n\n### **Key Equations & Metrics**\n*(Focus on performance and scalability calculations)*\n\n1. **Spark Parallelism**:\n   - **Optimal Partitions**: `total_cores * 2\u20134` (avoid too many small tasks).\n   - **Partition Size**: Aim for **100MB\u20131GB** per partition.\n\n2. **Kafka Throughput**:\n   - **Max Throughput per Partition**: ~1MB/s (depends on disk/network).\n   - **Total Throughput**: `num_partitions * throughput_per_partition`.\n\n3. **Spark Memory Tuning**:\n   - **Executor Memory**:\n     ```\n     spark.executor.memory = (total_memory * 0.7) / num_executors\n     ```\n   - **Overhead Memory**: ~10% of `executor.memory` for JVM.\n\n4. **Batch Processing Time**:\n   - **Amdahl\u2019s Law**: Speedup limited by serial components.\n     ```\n     Speedup \u2264 1 / (serial_fraction + parallel_fraction/N)\n     ```\n     where `N` = number of workers.\n\n5. **Streaming Latency**:\n   - **End-to-End Latency**: `ingest_time + processing_time + emit_time`.\n   - **Micro-Batch Latency**: Spark\u2019s `trigger.ProcessingTime(\"1 minute\")`.\n\n6. **Data Skew Mitigation**:\n   - **Salting**: Add random prefix to keys to distribute load:\n     ```\n     key_salted = (key, random_salt)  # Distribute across reducers\n     ```\n\n7. **Kafka Replication Overhead**:\n   - **Storage Overhead**: `replication.factor * data_size`.\n   - **ISR (In-Sync Replicas)**: Minimum `min.insync.replicas` for durability.\n\n8. **Cost Optimization**:\n   - **Spark Dynamic Allocation**:\n     ```\n     spark.dynamicAllocation.enabled=true\n     spark.shuffle.service.enabled=true\n     ```\n   - **Cloud Cost**: `VM_cost + storage_cost + network_egress`.\n\n---\n\n---\n\n### **Mermaid Knowledge Graphs**\n#### **Graph 1: Big Data Ecosystem**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Big Data] --> B[Batch Processing]\n    A --> C[Stream Processing]\n    B --> D[Hadoop MapReduce]\n    B --> E[Spark Batch]\n    C --> F[Spark Streaming]\n    C --> G[Kafka Streams]\n    C --> H[Flink]\n    D --> I[HDFS]\n    E --> J[DataFrames]\n    F --> K[Structured Streaming]\n    G --> L[Kafka Topics]\n    H --> M[Stateful Operators]\n    J --> N[Catalyst Optimizer]\n    K --> O[Watermarking]\n    L --> P[Partitions]\n    P --> Q[Replication]\n```\n\n#### **Graph 2: Spark vs. MapReduce**\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n    A[Spark] --> B[In-Memory]\n    A --> C[DAG Execution]\n    A --> D[Lazy Evaluation]\n    D --> E[Actions Trigger Jobs]\n    A --> F[DataFrames]\n    F --> G[SQL Support]\n    H[MapReduce] --> I[Disk-Based]\n    H --> J[Barrier Sync]\n    H --> K[Map & Reduce Only]\n    A --> L[Libraries: MLlib, GraphX]\n    H --> M[No Native ML]\n```\n\n#### **Graph 3: Kafka Architecture**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Kafka Cluster] --> B[Broker 1]\n    A --> C[Broker 2]\n    B --> D[Topic A: Partition 0]\n    B --> E[Topic A: Partition 1]\n    C --> F[Topic A: Partition 0 Replica]\n    C --> G[Topic A: Partition 1 Replica]\n    D --> H[Leader]\n    F --> H\n    E --> I[Follower]\n    G --> I\n    J[Producer] --> D\n    J --> E\n    K[Consumer Group] --> D\n    K --> E\n    H --> L[ISR: In-Sync Replicas]\n```\n\n#### **Graph 4: Cloud-Native Big Data**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Google Cloud] --> B[Dataproc]\n    A --> C[Dataflow]\n    A --> D[BigQuery]\n    A --> E[Pub/Sub]\n    B --> F[Managed Spark/Hadoop]\n    C --> G[Apache Beam]\n    D --> H[Serverless SQL]\n    E --> I[Message Queue]\n    A --> J[GCS]\n    J --> K[Data Lake]\n    F --> L[HDFS/Object Storage]\n    G --> M[Streaming/Batch]\n    I --> N[Kafka Alternative]\n```\n\n#### **Graph 5: Streaming Processing Pipeline**\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n    A[Kafka Topic] --> B[Spark Structured Streaming]\n    B --> C[Window Aggregations]\n    C --> D[Watermarking]\n    B --> E[Stateful Operations]\n    E --> F[Checkpointing]\n    B --> G[Output Modes]\n    G --> H[Append]\n    G --> I[Complete]\n    G --> J[Update]\n    I --> K[Dashboard]\n    J --> K\n    F --> L[Fault Recovery]\n```\n\n#### **Graph 6: Performance Optimization**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Slow Spark Job] --> B[Check Partitioning]\n    A --> C[Broadcast Small Tables]\n    A --> D[Cache Intermediate Data]\n    A --> E[Tune Executor Memory]\n    B --> F[Repartition/Coalesce]\n    C --> G[Avoid Shuffles]\n    D --> H[persist()]\n    E --> I[spark.executor.memory]\n    A --> J[Enable CBO]\n    J --> K[ANALYZE TABLE]\n    A --> L[Dynamic Allocation]\n```\n\n---\n\n---\n### **Exam Tips**\n1. **Focus Areas**:\n   -
