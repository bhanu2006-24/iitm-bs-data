                        "In the class, we saw the UDF for mobilenet_v2. By definition, UDFs are scalar. In Spark, there is another class of user defined routines called UDAFs, which stand for User Defined Aggregator Functions. UDAFs are meant to provide a means to write a custom aggregation function which aggregates over a grouping of values to arrive at a single value. UDAF structure differs saliently from UDFs in that it exposes the notion of a buffer as a way of maintaining intermediate state before finalizing aggregate output. Why is a buffer required for UDAF and not for a UDF?"

Consider also that apart from the functional logic, the same application is also emitting into a file the start time and end time of every batch invocation for audit purposes.  Assume there is a failure in one of the Dataproc machines that results in a failure of a specific run. For the external world (i.e. anybody consuming the outputs of this application), will they see any change in output as a result of the failure at all, or will the only impact of failure be one of slower performance for the failed-and-retried run? select the one from the list below that answer this question."

        "summary": "Here\u2019s a structured **summary of core topics, concepts, principles, and equations** for the **\"Introduction to Big Data\"** exam, followed by **Mermaid knowledge graphs** to visualize relationships.\n\n---\n\n## **Core Topics & Concepts Summary**\n### **1. Batch vs. Streaming Processing**\n- **Batch Processing**:\n  - Operates on **static, bounded datasets** (e.g., daily logs).\n  - High latency, assumes **complete data**.\n  - Examples: Hadoop MapReduce, Spark batch jobs.\n- **Streaming Processing**:\n  - Operates on **dynamic, unbounded data** (e.g., real-time sensor data).\n  - Low latency, **no assumption of completeness**.\n  - Uses **windows** (e.g., tumbling, sliding) to group data.\n  - Examples: Spark Streaming, Kafka Streams, Flink.\n- **Common Capabilities**:\n  - Both can handle **massively large datasets** (scalability).\n  - Both can use **windowing** (streaming uses time windows; batch uses logical partitions).\n\n**Key Equation (Windowing in Streaming)**:\n- **Tumbling Window**: Fixed-size, non-overlapping (e.g., 5-minute chunks).\n- **Sliding Window**: Fixed-size, overlapping (e.g., 5-minute window sliding every 1 minute).\n- **Session Window**: Dynamic, gap-based (e.g., 30-minute inactivity ends a session).\n\n---\n\n### **2. Spark Optimizations**\n#### **Spark SQL Performance**\n- **Cost-Based Optimizer (CBO)**: Uses statistics (e.g., `ANALYZE TABLE`) to optimize query plans.\n- **Partitioning**: Distributes data by a key (e.g., `df.repartition(\"key\")`).\n- **Caching**: Persists DataFrames in memory (`df.cache()`).\n- **Broadcast Join**: For small tables, broadcast to all executors (`spark.sql.autoBroadcastJoinThreshold`).\n\n**Key Commands**:\n```sql\n-- Enable CBO\nSET spark.sql.cbo.enabled=true;\n-- Analyze table stats\nANALYZE TABLE table_name COMPUTE STATISTICS;\n-- Broadcast hint\nSELECT /*+ BROADCAST(small_table) */ * FROM large_table JOIN small_table;\n```\n\n#### **Structured Streaming**\n- **Exactly-Once Semantics**: Guarantees no duplicates/missing data via **checkpointing** and **idempotent sinks** (e.g., Kafka offsets).\n- **Output Modes**:\n  - **Append**: Only new results (e.g., `df.writeStream.outputMode(\"append\")`).\n  - **Complete**: Full aggregated state (e.g., for dashboards).\n  - **Update**: Only changed rows.\n- **Watermarking**: Handles late data (e.g., `df.withWatermark(\"time\", \"10 minutes\")`).\n\n**Key Code Snippet**:\n```python\ndf.writeStream \\\n  .outputMode(\"complete\") \\\n  .format(\"kafka\") \\\n  .option(\"checkpointLocation\", \"/path\") \\\n  .start()\n```\n\n---\n\n### **3. Pub/Sub & Message Queues**\n- **Push vs. Pull Delivery**:\n  - **Push**: Pub/Sub sends messages to subscribers (higher throughput).\n  - **Pull**: Subscribers request messages (better for controlled rates).\n- **Subscription Types**:\n  - **Shared**: Messages distributed across subscribers (load balancing).\n  - **Exclusive**: One subscriber gets all messages.\n- **Use Cases**:\n  - **Pull**: When subscribers need to control processing rate.\n  - **Push**: For real-time, high-throughput systems.\n\n**Key Diagram**:\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n    Publisher --> Topic\n    Topic -->|Push| Subscriber1\n    Topic -->|Push| Subscriber2\n    Subscriber3 -->|Pull| Topic\n```\n\n---\n\n### **4. Kafka Architecture**\n- **Brokers**: Servers storing topic partitions.\n- **Topics & Partitions**:\n  - **Partitions**: Ordered, immutable sequences of records.\n  - **Replication**: Copies of partitions for fault tolerance.\n- **Producers/Consumers**:\n  - Producers write to topics; consumers read from partitions.\n  - **Consumer Groups**: Parallel consumption (each partition \u2192 1 consumer).\n- **Scaling**:\n  - **Add Brokers**: Distributes load (improves **availability** and **throughput**).\n  - **Increase Partitions**: Parallelizes consumption (but adds overhead).\n\n**Key Equations**:\n- **Throughput** = (Partitions \u00d7 Replication Factor) / Brokers\n- **Availability** = 1 - (Probability of all replicas failing)\n\n---\n\n### **5. Fault Tolerance & Recovery**\n- **Checkpointing**: Saves state (e.g., Spark Streaming offsets) to recover from failures.\n- **Idempotent Sinks**: Ensures no duplicates (e.g., Kafka transactions).\n- **Side Effects**: Non-idempotent operations (e.g., writing timestamps) can break exactly-once semantics.\n\n**Example**:\n```python\n# Spark Structured Streaming with checkpointing\ndf.writeStream \\\n  .option(\"checkpointLocation\", \"/checkpoint_dir\") \\\n  .start()\n```\n\n---\n\n### **6. UDFs vs. UDAFs in Spark**\n- **UDF (User-Defined Function)**:\n  - Scalar operation (1 input row \u2192 1 output).\n  - No intermediate state (e.g., `def square(x): return x*x`).\n- **UDAF (User-Defined Aggregate Function)**:\n  - Aggregates multiple rows (e.g., `SUM`, `AVG`).\n  - Uses a **buffer** to store intermediate state (e.g., partial sums).\n  - Example: Custom `MY_AVG` aggregating values across groups.\n\n**Key Code**:\n```python\nfrom pyspark.sql.functions import pandas_udf\n@pandas_udf(\"double\")\ndef my_udf(x: pd.Series) -> pd.Series:\n    return x * 2  # Scalar UDF\n```\n\n---\n\n### **7. Cloud & Infrastructure (IaaS vs. PaaS)**\n- **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)**:\n  - Manage VMs, storage, networking (e.g., GCP VMs, Hadoop on VMs).\n- **PaaS (Platform as a Service)**:\n  - Managed services (e.g., Dataproc, Dataflow, Cloud Functions).\n- **Serverless**: No infrastructure management (e.g., Pub/Sub, Dataflow).\n\n**Order of PaaS/IaaS (Most IaaS \u2192 Most PaaS)**:\n1. VMs + Hadoop/HBase (IaaS)\n2. Kubernetes + Spark (Hybrid)\n3. Dataproc (Managed Spark)\n4. Dataflow (Serverless)\n5. Cloud Functions + Pub/Sub (Fully PaaS)\n\n---\n\n### **8. Real-Time Analytics & Dashboards**\n- **Requirements**:\n  - Low latency (<1 min refresh).\n  - **Complete Output Mode**: For full state (e.g., all stations in IRCTC example).\n  - **Watermarking**: Handle late data (e.g., `df.withWatermark(\"time\", \"5 minutes\")`).\n- **Architecture**:\n  - **Source**: Kafka/Pub/Sub \u2192 **Processing**: Spark/Flink \u2192 **Sink**: Dashboard (e.g., Redis, Datastore).\n\n**Example Pipeline**:\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n    Kafka --> Spark_Streaming -->|Complete Mode| Datastore --> Dashboard\n```\n\n---\n\n### **9. Model Serving & Edge Computing**\n- **Edge ML**: Run models on-device (e.g., spider cam in cricket bat example).\n- **Trade-offs**:\n  - **Cloud**: Higher latency but scalable.\n  - **Edge**: Lower latency but limited resources.\n- **Hybrid Approach**:\n  - Periodically retrain in cloud \u2192 deploy compressed model to edge.\n\n**Key Steps**:\n1. Collect data on edge.\n2. Send batches to cloud for retraining.\n3. Deploy updated model to edge.\n\n---\n\n## **Mermaid Knowledge Graphs**\n### **1.
