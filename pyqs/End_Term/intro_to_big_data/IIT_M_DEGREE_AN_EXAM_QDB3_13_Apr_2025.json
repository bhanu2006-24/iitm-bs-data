The input data is coming into GCS every minute from a variety of sources as standalone files. Therefore, the business leader now feels that having to wait till 9AM the next day is no longer acceptable and instead ideally wants purchase information for each customer at least every 5 minutes during the day itself.

As a result of management change, the company has decided to shutdown its business in the Middle East and relocate all of its operations and business HQ to India. Which of the following changes will need to be done to its ETL pipeline to ensure the correct output continues to be produced?"

When there is a chance of a catch by this fielder, the watch continually whispers every second to go forward, back, left or right thus improving his chances of settling under the ball and taking the catch. The watch is connected to the spider cam. The spider cam is itself a powerful ARM-based computer which has connectivity to the Cloud, an all-seeing AI-powered superbeing, through the wire on which it hangs. Using this connectivity, it can send as much or as little data as required and also receive instructions from the cloud. Your task is to design the data pipeline that enables such feedback to the fielder for every ball that comes his way with as much accuracy as possible throughout the match. You are given two ML models: a vision model that given a frame from the spider cam computes an alert if the ball is headed to him, and an adjustment model that helps adjust catch positioning of the fielder which takes as input a continuous video feed. Which of the following options best satisfies the requirements?",

        "summary": "Here\u2019s a structured **summary of core topics, concepts, principles, and equations** essential for the **\"Introduction to Big Data\"** exam, followed by **Mermaid knowledge graphs** to visualize relationships.\n\n---\n\n---\n\n### **Core Topics & Concepts Summary**\n#### **1. Big Data Architectures & Ecosystems**\n- **Batch vs. Streaming Processing**:\n  - **Batch**: Operates on static, bounded data (e.g., daily sales aggregation).\n    - Tools: Spark Batch, Hadoop MapReduce.\n    - Characteristics: High latency, complete data assumption.\n  - **Streaming**: Operates on unbounded, real-time data (e.g., inventory updates every minute).\n    - Tools: Spark Structured Streaming, Kafka Streams, Google Dataflow.\n    - Characteristics: Low latency, handles late data, windowed aggregations.\n  - **Common Capabilities** (Spark):\n    - Same syntax for batch/streaming (DataFrame API).\n    - Schema evolution support.\n    - Scalability to large datasets (streaming via micro-batches).\n\n- **Lambda vs. Kappa Architecture**:\n  - **Lambda**: Separate batch (accuracy) and speed (real-time) layers.\n  - **Kappa**: Unified streaming layer (simpler, but requires replayability).\n\n- **IaaS vs. PaaS**:\n  - **IaaS**: Infrastructure as a Service (e.g., self-managed Kafka/Hadoop VMs).\n  - **PaaS**: Platform as a Service (e.g., Google Dataflow, Pub/Sub, Vertex AI).\n  - **Order of Abstraction**: `(IaaS) VMs \u2192 Kubernetes \u2192 Dataproc \u2192 Dataflow (PaaS)`.\n\n#### **2. Data Processing Frameworks**\n- **Apache Spark**:\n  - **RDDs vs. DataFrames**:\n    - RDDs: Low-level, immutable distributed collections (Spark 1.0).\n    - DataFrames: Optimized with Catalyst optimizer, schema-aware.\n  - **Optimizations**:\n    - **Broadcast Join**: For small tables (`spark.sql.autoBroadcastJoinThreshold`).\n    - **Partitioning**: Avoid shuffles by partitioning on join keys.\n    - **Caching**: Persist intermediate DataFrames (`df.cache()`).\n    - **Cost-Based Optimizer (CBO)**: Enable with `spark.sql.cbo.enabled=true`.\n    - **Statistics**: Run `ANALYZE TABLE` to update metadata for better query planning.\n  - **Structured Streaming**:\n    - **Output Modes**:\n      - `Append`: Only new results (e.g., alerts).\n      - `Complete`: Full aggregated table (e.g., dashboards).\n      - `Update`: Only changed rows (e.g., inventory updates).\n    - **Fault Tolerance**:\n      - Exactly-once semantics via checkpointing + idempotent sinks.\n      - Retries failed micro-batches (no data loss, but potential latency).\n    - **Watermarking**: Handle late data in windowed aggregations.\n\n- **Google Dataflow**:\n  - Fully managed Spark alternative (PaaS).\n  - Auto-scaling, serverless execution.\n\n- **Flink**:\n  - True streaming (no micro-batches), stateful processing.\n\n#### **3. Message Brokers & Event Streaming**\n- **Kafka**:\n  - **Partitions**: Parallelism unit (1 partition = 1 consumer thread).\n  - **Consumer Groups**: Scale consumption (each group gets all messages).\n  - **Offsets**: Track progress (committed offsets enable fault tolerance).\n  - **Scaling**:\n    - Add brokers (horizontal scaling).\n    - Increase partitions (but requires consumer rebalancing).\n  - **Exactly-Once Semantics**: Transactions + idempotent producers.\n\n- **Google Pub/Sub**:\n  - Serverless, auto-scaling alternative to Kafka.\n  - Decouples publishers/subscribers (subscribers control consumption rate).\n\n#### **4. Data Storage & Databases**\n- **Data Lakes**:\n  - Raw data storage (e.g., GCS, S3) for analytics.\n  - Schema-on-read (vs. schema-on-write in databases).\n- **NoSQL Databases**:\n  - **Redis**: In-memory key-value store (low-latency KPIs).\n  - **HBase/Datastore**: Scalable, distributed NoSQL for real-time apps.\n- **OLTP vs. OLAP**:\n  - **OLTP**: Transactional (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL).\n  - **OLAP**: Analytical (e.g., Hadoop, BigQuery).\n\n#### **5. Real-Time Analytics & Dashboards**\n- **Requirements**:\n  - Low-latency updates (e.g., 1-minute refresh).\n  - Time synchronization (e.g., display timestamp on dashboard).\n- **Tools**:\n  - Spark Streaming \u2192 Aggregations \u2192 Visualization (e.g., Tableau, Grafana).\n  - **State Management**: Track incremental updates (e.g., inventory counts).\n\n#### **6. Machine Learning in Big Data**\n- **Distributed Training**:\n  - **Data Parallelism**: Split data across workers (e.g., Spark MLlib).\n  - **Model Parallelism**: Split model across workers (e.g., large DL models).\n- **Model Serving**:\n  - **Vertex AI**: Managed ML deployment (PaaS).\n  - **Edge Devices**: Deploy compressed models (e.g., smartwatch use case).\n- **Optimizations**:\n  - **Model Compression**: Reduce size for edge deployment (e.g., pruning, quantization).\n  - **Batch Inference**: Trade latency for cost (e.g., CPU-only clusters).\n\n#### **7. Fault Tolerance & Recovery**\n- **Checkpointing**:\n  - Save state periodically (e.g., Spark Streaming checkpoints).\n- **Idempotent Sinks**:\n  - Ensure retries don\u2019t duplicate outputs (e.g., Kafka transactions).\n- **Replayability**:\n  - Message brokers (Kafka/PubSub) must support offset replay for recovery.\n\n#### **8. Performance Tuning**\n- **Spark SQL**:\n  - **Skew Handling**: Salting keys, adaptive query execution (`spark.sql.adaptive.enabled`).\n  - **Join Strategies**: Broadcast hash join for small tables.\n- **Streaming**:\n  - **Micro-Batch Duration**: Balance latency vs. throughput.\n  - **Resource Allocation**: Scale executors based on workload.\n\n#### **9. Time Handling in Distributed Systems**\n- **Event Time vs. Processing Time**:\n  - **Event Time**: When the event occurred (e.g., sale timestamp).\n  - **Processing Time**: When the system processed it.\n- **Weekend/Timezone Changes**:\n  - Business logic must adapt to new definitions (e.g., Friday-Saturday \u2192 Sunday-Monday).\n\n#### **10. Cost Optimization**\n- **Trade-offs**:\n  - **Latency vs. Cost**: Batch processing is cheaper but slower.\n  - **GPU vs. CPU**: GPUs for DL training, CPUs for batch inference.\n- **Cloud Strategies**:\n  - **Dataproc**: Managed Spark (IaaS).\n  - **Dataflow**: Serverless (PaaS).\n\n---\n\n### **Key Equations (Mathematics/Performance)**\n1. **Spark Parallelism**:\n   - Optimal partitions = `Total data size / Target partition size (128MB\u20131GB)`.\n   - Example: For 10GB data \u2192 20 partitions (512MB each).\n\n2. **Kafka Throughput**:\n   - `Throughput = (Partitions \u00d7 Replication Factor) \u00d7 (Message Size / Compression Ratio)`.\n   - Scaling: Increase partitions or brokers.\n\n3. **Streaming Latency**:\n   - `End-to-End Latency = Ingestion Latency + Processing Latency + Sink Latency`.\n   - Example: Kafka (10ms) + Spark (500ms) + DB (20ms) = 530ms.\n\n4. **Model Compression Ratio**:\n   - `Compression Ratio = Original Size / Compressed Size`.\n   - Example: MobileNetV2 (50MB) \u2192 New model (5MB) \u2192 10\u00d7 compression.\n\n5. **Cost of Spark Cluster**:\n   - `Cost = (Number of Workers \u00d7 Hours \u00d7 Price per Worker) + Storage Costs`.\n   - Example: 10 workers \u00d7 24h \u00d7 $0.2/h = $48/day.\n\n---\n\n### **Mermaid Knowledge Graphs**\n#### **1.
