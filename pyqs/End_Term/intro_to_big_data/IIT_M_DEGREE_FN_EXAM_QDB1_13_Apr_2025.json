The watch is connected to the spider cam. The spider cam is itself a powerful ARM-based computer which has connectivity to the Cloud, an all-seeing AI-powered superbeing, through the wire on which it hangs. Using this connectivity, it can send as much or as little data as required and also receive instructions from the cloud. Your task is to design the data pipeline that enables such feedback to the fielder for every ball that comes his way with as much accuracy as possible throughout the match. You are given two ML models: a vision model that given a frame from the spider cam computes an alert if the ball is headed to him, and an adjustment model that helps adjust catch positioning of the fielder which takes as input a continuous video feed. Which of the following options best satisfies the requirements?"

The model with the best recall rate from the PyTorch library runs in under 3 seconds on an average, when executing on a GPU-powered Spark cluster. Your management has now instructed you to reduce the cost of AI projects significantly, and has given guidance that latency of execution is not a concern since the consumer for the model output is batch oriented, and also that they would be ok with a lesser recall rate provided the drop isn\u2019t significant.

        "summary": "Here\u2019s a structured **summary of core topics, concepts, principles, and equations** essential for the **\"Introduction to Big Data\"** exam, followed by **Mermaid knowledge graphs** to visualize relationships.\n\n---\n\n---\n\n### **Core Topics & Concepts**\n#### **1. Big Data Fundamentals**\n   - **Definition**: High-volume, high-velocity, and/or high-variety data requiring distributed processing.\n   - **4Vs**: Volume, Velocity, Variety, Veracity.\n   - **Batch vs. Streaming**:\n     - **Batch**: Process large datasets in fixed time windows (e.g., MapReduce, Hive).\n     - **Streaming**: Process data in real-time (e.g., Spark Streaming, Kafka).\n   - **Scalability**: Horizontal (adding machines) vs. Vertical (upgrading hardware).\n\n#### **2. Distributed Processing Frameworks**\n   - **MapReduce**:\n     - **Phases**: Map \u2192 Shuffle \u2192 Reduce.\n     - **Limitations**: Disk-heavy, rigid structure (only Map/Reduce steps).\n     - **Fault Tolerance**: Re-executes failed tasks.\n   - **Spark**:\n     - **Advantages**: In-memory processing, DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) optimization, lazy evaluation.\n     - **Components**:\n       - **RDDs** (Resilient Distributed Datasets): Immutable, partitioned collections.\n       - **DataFrames/Datasets**: Optimized tabular data (Catalyst optimizer).\n       - **Structured Streaming**: Micro-batch processing with exactly-once semantics.\n     - **Actions vs. Transformations**:\n       - **Transformations** (e.g., `map`, `filter`): Lazy, return new RDD/DataFrame.\n       - **Actions** (e.g., `count`, `collect`): Trigger computation.\n   - **YARN**: Resource manager (not a processing framework).\n\n#### **3. Data Storage & Serialization**\n   - **HDFS**: Distributed file system (replication, block storage).\n   - **Parquet/ORC**: Columnar storage formats for analytics.\n   - **Kafka**: Distributed event streaming (topics, partitions, brokers, offsets).\n     - **Scaling**: Add brokers/partitions (not disks).\n     - **Semantics**:\n       - **At-least-once**: Retries may cause duplicates.\n       - **At-most-once**: No retries (data loss possible).\n       - **Exactly-once**: Idempotent processing (Spark Structured Streaming).\n\n#### **4. Cloud-Native & Serverless Architectures**\n   - **Cloud-Native Principles**:\n     - **Resilience**: Auto-recovery from failures.\n     - **Observability**: Metrics, logs, tracing.\n     - **Scalability**: Auto-scaling (e.g., Kubernetes, serverless).\n   - **Serverless Options**:\n     - **Google Cloud Functions**: Event-driven, no infrastructure management.\n     - **Dataproc**: Managed Spark/Hadoop.\n     - **Dataflow**: Fully managed stream/batch processing (Apache Beam).\n\n#### **5. Performance Optimization**\n   - **Broadcast Variables**: Cache small datasets (e.g., 1MB lookup tables) on workers.\n   - **Partitioning**: Avoid skew (e.g., `repartition` in Spark).\n   - **Caching**: Persist RDDs/DataFrames in memory (`cache()`, `persist()`).\n   - **UDFs (User-Defined Functions)**: Avoid when possible (use built-in operations).\n   - **ELT vs. ETL**:\n     - **ELT**: Extract \u2192 Load \u2192 Transform (leverages distributed processing).\n     - **ETL**: Extract \u2192 Transform \u2192 Load (bottlenecks on single machine).\n\n#### **6. Fault Tolerance & Recovery**\n   - **Checkpointing**: Save state (e.g., Spark Streaming offsets).\n   - **Idempotence**: Ensure retries don\u2019t duplicate side effects.\n   - **Kafka Offsets**: Track consumed messages for recovery.\n\n#### **7. Time Handling in Data Pipelines**\n   - **Event Time**: When the event occurred (e.g., timestamp in data).\n   - **Processing Time**: When the system processes the event.\n   - **Watermarks**: Handle late data in streaming (e.g., `withWatermark` in Spark).\n\n#### **8. Machine Learning in Big Data**\n   - **Distributed ML**: Train models on clusters (e.g., Spark MLlib, TensorFlow on Spark).\n   - **Model Serving**:\n     - **Batch**: Precompute predictions (e.g., daily).\n     - **Real-time**: Serve models via APIs (e.g., TensorFlow Serving).\n   - **Optimizations**:\n     - **Model Size**: Smaller models reduce latency/cost (e.g., quantized models).\n     - **Hardware**: GPUs for training, CPUs for inference (if latency is flexible).\n\n#### **9. Data Ingestion & Pipelines**\n   - **CDC (Change Data Capture)**: Capture database changes (e.g., Debezium).\n   - **Lambda Architecture**: Batch + Speed layers (now often replaced by **Kappa Architecture** with streaming-only).\n   - **Edge Processing**: Process data near the source (e.g., IoT devices, spider cam in Q12).\n\n#### **10. Cost Optimization**\n   - **Right-Sizing**: Match cluster resources to workload.\n   - **Spot Instances**: Cheaper but preemptible (for fault-tolerant jobs).\n   - **Serverless**: Pay-per-use (e.g., Cloud Functions, BigQuery).\n\n---\n\n### **Key Equations/Principles**\n1. **MapReduce WordCount Pseudocode**:\n   ```python\n   # Mapper\n   def map(key, value):\n       for word in value.split():\n           emit(word, 1)\n\n   # Reducer\n   def reduce(key, values):\n       emit(key, sum(values))\n   ```\n\n2. **Spark RDD Lineage**:\n   - RDDs track transformations (e.g., `map`, `filter`) to recompute lost partitions.\n\n3. **Kafka Throughput**:\n   - **Throughput \u221d (Partitions \u00d7 Replication Factor) / Brokers**.\n   - Scaling: Add brokers or partitions (not disks).\n\n4. **Spark Broadcast Threshold**:\n   - Use broadcast if dataset size < **10MB** (configurable via `spark.sql.autoBroadcastJoinThreshold`).\n\n5. **Exactly-Once Processing**:\n   - **Spark + Kafka Integration**:\n     - Commit offsets **after** writing output (transactional writes).\n\n6. **Watermarking in Structured Streaming**:\n   - `df.withWatermark(\"eventTime\", \"10 minutes\")`: Ignore data older than watermark.\n\n7. **Cost of Distributed Joins**:\n   - **Shuffle Join**: Expensive (O(N log N)).\n   - **Broadcast Join**: O(1) if small table is broadcast.\n\n---\n\n### **Mermaid Knowledge Graphs**\n#### **1.
