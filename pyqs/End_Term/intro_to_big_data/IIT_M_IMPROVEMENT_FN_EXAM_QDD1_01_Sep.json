                        "Consider a Structured Streaming application running on Google Dataproc firing up every 10 seconds, consuming any number of records from Kafka available since last read, and emitting some computed answers to another Kafka topic. Consider also that apart from the functional logic, the same application is also emitting into a file the start time and end time of every batch invocation for audit purposes.  Assume there is a failure in one of the Dataproc machines that results in a failure of a specific run. For the external world (i.e. anybody consuming the outputs of this application), will they see any change in output as a result of the failure at all, or will the only visible impact of failure be of slower performance for the failed-and-retried run?"

        "summary": "Here\u2019s a structured **summary of core topics, concepts, principles, and equations** essential for the **\"Introduction to Big Data\"** exam, followed by **Mermaid knowledge graphs** to visualize relationships.\n\n---\n\n---\n\n### **Core Topics & Concepts Summary**\n#### **1. Big Data Fundamentals**\n- **Definition**: High-volume, high-velocity, and/or high-variety data requiring distributed processing.\n- **4 Vs of Big Data**: Volume, Velocity, Variety, Veracity.\n- **Batch vs. Stream Processing**:\n  - **Batch**: Processes finite datasets (e.g., Hadoop MapReduce, Spark batch).\n  - **Stream**: Processes unbounded, real-time data (e.g., Spark Streaming, Kafka Streams).\n- **Divide-and-Conquer Paradigm**: Splitting problems into smaller subproblems (e.g., MapReduce, Spark).\n\n#### **2. Distributed Systems & Architectures**\n- **Cloud-Native Design Principles**:\n  - **Resilience**: Auto-recovery from failures (e.g., Kafka retries, Spark checkpointing).\n  - **Observability**: Logging, metrics, and tracing (e.g., Spark UI, Kafka monitoring).\n  - **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling (e.g., adding Kafka brokers, Spark executors).\n  - **Managed Services**: PaaS (e.g., Google Dataflow, Dataproc) vs. IaaS (e.g., self-managed Hadoop).\n- **Hot Potato Principle**: Minimal processing per stage in stream pipelines to hand off data quickly (e.g., Spark Structured Streaming micro-batches).\n\n#### **3. Hadoop & MapReduce**\n- **MapReduce**:\n  - **Map**: Emits `<key, value>` pairs.\n  - **Shuffle**: Groups by key.\n  - **Reduce**: Aggregates values per key.\n  - **Limitations**: Disk-heavy, rigid (only Map/Reduce steps), barrier synchronization.\n- **Hadoop Ecosystem**:\n  - **HDFS**: Distributed file system.\n  - **YARN**: Resource manager.\n\n#### **4. Apache Spark**\n- **Key Features**:\n  - In-memory computation (vs. MapReduce\u2019s disk-based).\n  - Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) for parallel execution.\n  - Lazy evaluation (optimizes execution plan).\n- **Components**:\n  - **Spark Core**: RDDs (Resilient Distributed Datasets).\n  - **Spark SQL**: DataFrames/Datasets (optimized with Catalyst optimizer).\n  - **Spark Streaming**: Micro-batch processing (e.g., `window` operations).\n  - **Structured Streaming**: Unified batch/stream API with exactly-once semantics.\n- **Optimizations**:\n  - **Broadcast Variables**: Send small datasets to all workers (e.g., lookup tables).\n  - **Partitioning**: Avoid shuffles (e.g., `repartition`, `coalesce`).\n  - **Caching**: Persist RDDs/DataFrames in memory (`cache()`, `persist()`).\n  - **Cost-Based Optimizer (CBO)**: Uses statistics (e.g., `ANALYZE TABLE`).\n- **Fault Tolerance**:\n  - **Checkpointing**: Save state for recovery (e.g., Spark Streaming).\n  - **Lineage**: Recompute lost RDDs from transformations.\n\n#### **5. Apache Kafka**\n- **Publishing-Subscription Model**:\n  - **Topics**: Categories for messages.\n  - **Partitions**: Ordered, immutable logs (scaled via brokers).\n  - **Producers/Consumers**: Publish/read messages (e.g., `Pub/Sub` in GCP).\n  - **Consumer Groups**: Parallel consumption (each partition \u2192 1 consumer).\n- **Guarantees**:\n  - **At-Least-Once**: Messages may be reprocessed.\n  - **Exactly-Once**: Idempotent processing (e.g., Spark + Kafka integration).\n- **Scaling**:\n  - Add brokers/partitions (not disks/memory alone).\n  - **Replication Factor**: Copies of partitions for availability.\n\n#### **6. Data Processing Patterns**\n- **ETL/ELT Pipelines**:\n  - **Extract**: CDC (Change Data Capture), Kafka Connect.\n  - **Transform**: Spark, Dataflow.\n  - **Load**: Datastores (e.g., HBase, Datastore, Redis).\n- **Lambda Architecture**:\n  - Batch (accuracy) + Stream (speed) layers.\n- **Kappa Architecture**:\n  - Stream-only (e.g., Kafka + Spark Streaming).\n\n#### **7. Performance Optimization**\n- **Spark**:\n  - Avoid `collect()` (driver OOM risk).\n  - Use `broadcast` for small joins.\n  - Tune `spark.default.parallelism` (partitions = cores \u00d7 2\u20133).\n- **Kafka**:\n  - Increase partitions for throughput (but not beyond consumers).\n  - Monitor lag (`kafka-consumer-groups`).\n- **Data Skew**:\n  - Salting keys (e.g., `key \u2192 (key, random_suffix)`).\n  - Custom partitioning.\n\n#### **8. Data Serialization & Storage**\n- **Formats**:\n  - **CSV/JSON**: Human-readable (slow).\n  - **Parquet/ORC**: Columnar (fast for analytics).\n  - **Avro**: Row-based + schema evolution.\n- **Datastores**:\n  - **HBase**: Wide-column (OLTP).\n  - **Datastore**: NoSQL (GCP PaaS).\n  - **Redis**: In-memory key-value (low-latency).\n\n#### **9. Real-Time Analytics**\n- **Use Cases**:\n  - Fraud detection (streaming).\n  - Dashboards (e.g., Spark + Kafka \u2192 Redis).\n- **Latency Trade-offs**:\n  - **Batch**: High latency, high accuracy.\n  - **Stream**: Low latency, approximate (e.g., sliding windows).\n\n#### **10. Cost & Resource Management**\n- **Cloud Cost Optimization**:\n  - **Dataproc**: Managed Spark/Hadoop (cheaper than VMs).\n  - **Dataflow**: Serverless (auto-scaling).\n  - **Spot Instances**: For fault-tolerant workloads.\n- **Right-Sizing**:\n  - Match resources to workload (e.g., GPU for DL models).\n\n#### **11. Data Governance & Observability**\n- **Monitoring**:\n  - Spark UI (stages, tasks).\n  - Kafka metrics (throughput, lag).\n- **Audit Logs**:\n  - Track batch start/end times (e.g., side effects in streaming).\n\n---\n\n---\n\n### **Key Equations & Metrics**\n*(Focus on mathematical concepts for performance tuning)*\n\n1. **Spark Parallelism**:\n   - **Optimal Partitions**:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Partitions} = \\text{Total Cores} \\times 2 \\text{\u2013}3\n     \\]\n   - **Data Skew Mitigation**:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Salting Key} = (\\text{original\\_key}, \\text{random\\_int} \\mod N)\n     \\]\n\n2. **Kafka Throughput**:\n   - **Partitions per Topic**:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Max Consumers} = \\text{Partitions}\n     \\]\n   - **Replication Overhead**:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Storage} = \\text{Data Size} \\times \\text{Replication Factor}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Streaming Latency**:\n   - **Micro-Batch Duration** (Spark):\n     \\[\n     \\text{Latency} = \\text{Batch Interval} + \\text{Processing Time}\n     \\]\n   - **Windowed Aggregations**:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Sliding Window} = \\text{Window Duration} / \\text{Slide Interval}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Cost Estimation** (Cloud):\n   - **Dataproc**:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Cost} = (\\text{VM Cost} + \\text{Storage Cost}) \\times \\text{Uptime}\n     \\]\n   - **Dataflow**:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Cost} = \\text{vCPU} \\times \\text{Hours} + \\text{Shuffle Storage}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Join Optimization**:\n   - **Broadcast Join Threshold** (Spark):\n     \\[\n     \\text{Broadcast if} \\quad \\text{Table Size} < \\text{spark.sql.autoBroadcastJoinThreshold}\n     \\]\n\n---\n\n---\n\n### **Mermaid Knowledge Graphs**\n#### **1.
