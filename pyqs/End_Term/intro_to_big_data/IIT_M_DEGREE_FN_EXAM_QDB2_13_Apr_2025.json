The spider cam is itself a powerful ARM-based computer which has connectivity to the Cloud, an all-seeing AI-powered superbeing, through the wire on which it hangs. Using this connectivity, it can send as much or as little data as required and also receive instructions from the cloud. Your task is to design the data pipeline that enables such feedback to the fielder for every ball that comes his way with as much accuracy as possible throughout the match. You are given two ML models: a vision model that given a frame from the spider cam computes an alert if the ball is headed to him, and an adjustment model that helps adjust catch positioning of the fielder which takes as input a continuous video feed. Which of the following options best satisfies the requirements?"

Your management has now instructed you to reduce the cost of AI projects significantly, and has given guidance that latency of execution is not a concern since the consumer for the model output is batch oriented, and also that they would be ok with a lesser recall rate provided the drop isn\u2019t significant.

        "summary": "Here\u2019s a structured **summary of core topics, concepts, principles, and equations** essential for the **\"Introduction to Big Data\"** exam, followed by **Mermaid knowledge graphs** to visualize relationships.\n\n---\n\n## **Core Topics & Concepts**\n### **1. Big Data Fundamentals**\n- **Definition**: High-volume, high-velocity, and/or high-variety data requiring distributed processing.\n- **4Vs of Big Data**: Volume, Velocity, Variety, Veracity.\n- **Batch vs. Streaming Processing**:\n  - **Batch**: Process large datasets in fixed time windows (e.g., MapReduce, Hive).\n  - **Streaming**: Process data in real-time (e.g., Spark Streaming, Kafka).\n\n### **2. Distributed Computing Frameworks**\n#### **Hadoop Ecosystem**\n- **HDFS**: Distributed file system for storing large datasets.\n- **MapReduce**:\n  - **Map**: Processes input data into key-value pairs.\n  - **Reduce**: Aggregates intermediate results.\n  - **Limitations**: Disk-heavy, rigid Map-Reduce paradigm, barrier synchronization.\n- **YARN**: Resource manager (not a divide-and-conquer paradigm).\n\n#### **Apache Spark**\n- **In-Memory Processing**: Faster than MapReduce (avoids disk I/O).\n- **RDDs (Resilient Distributed Datasets)**: Immutable, partitioned collections.\n- **DataFrames/Datasets**: Optimized tabular data structures (Catalyst optimizer).\n- **Spark Streaming**: Micro-batch processing (Discretized Streams).\n- **Structured Streaming**: High-level API for streaming (exactly-once semantics).\n- **Spark SQL**: SQL-like queries on DataFrames.\n- **Broadcast Variables**: Efficiently share small datasets across workers.\n- **Accumulators**: Shared variables for aggregation.\n\n#### **Key Differences: MapReduce vs. Spark**\n| Feature               | MapReduce                          | Spark                              |\n|-----------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| **Execution Model**   | Disk-based (slow)                  | In-memory (fast)                   |\n| **Flexibility**       | Rigid (Map \u2192 Reduce)               | DAG (arbitrary operations)         |\n| **Fault Tolerance**   | Re-executes tasks                  | Lineage-based recovery             |\n| **Latency**           | High (batch-only)                  | Low (streaming + batch)            |\n| **APIs**              | Limited (Map, Reduce)              | Rich (RDDs, DataFrames, SQL)      |\n\n---\n\n### **3. Big Data Processing Principles**\n#### **Hot Potato Principle**\n- **Goal**: Minimize work per processing step for **scalability** and **recoverability**.\n- **Key Rules**:\n  - Avoid heavy computations in any single step.\n  - Use intermediate storage (e.g., Kafka, message queues) for fault tolerance.\n  - **Not mandatory** (rule-of-thumb).\n- **Misconception**: Does **not** provide the same benefits for batch and streaming (false in Option B).\n\n#### **Divide-and-Conquer Paradigm**\n- **Examples**: Spark (RDDs, DataFrames), Hive (SQL on Hadoop), Spark MLlib.\n- **Non-Example**: YARN (resource manager, not a processing paradigm).\n\n#### **Cloud-Native Design**\n- **Characteristics**:\n  - **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling (e.g., auto-scaling in GCP).\n  - **Resilience**: Auto-recovery from failures.\n  - **Observability**: Logging, monitoring (e.g., Kafka for metadata).\n  - **Manageability**: Minimal manual intervention.\n- **Example**: Auto-scaling Spark on Dataproc with Kafka for logging.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Data Storage & Processing**\n#### **File Formats**\n- **RFC 4180 (CSV)**: Standard for comma-separated values.\n  - **Requirement**: Strict formatting (headers, consistent delimiters).\n  - **Non-compliant files** (e.g., `data.bin` with custom formatting) require manual parsing (e.g., `split(\",\")` in PySpark).\n\n#### **Data Lakes vs. Databases**\n- **Data Lake**: Raw data storage (e.g., HDFS, GCS).\n- **Database**: Structured query support (e.g., MongoDB, Redis).\n- **ETL vs. ELT**:\n  - **ETL**: Extract \u2192 Transform \u2192 Load (bottleneck: transformation in Python).\n  - **ELT**: Extract \u2192 Load \u2192 Transform (leverages Spark for scaling).\n\n---\n\n### **5. Streaming Systems**\n#### **Kafka**\n- **Broker**: Node storing topic partitions.\n- **Topic/Partition**: Logical data streams (parallelism via partitions).\n- **Consumer Groups**: Parallel consumption (1 consumer per partition).\n- **Offsets**: Track progress in topic consumption.\n- **Scaling**:\n  - **Add brokers** (not just disks or partitions) for throughput.\n  - **Partitions**: More partitions \u2192 higher parallelism (but overhead).\n\n#### **Stream Processing Semantics**\n| Semantic          | Description                          | Example                          |\n|-------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| **At-most-once**  | Messages may be lost.                | Kafka consumer auto-commit.     |\n| **At-least-once** | Messages may be duplicated.          | Spark + Kafka (retry on failure).|\n| **Exactly-once**  | No loss/duplication.                 | Spark Structured Streaming + Kafka transactions. |\n\n#### **Structured Streaming in Spark**\n- **Exactly-once processing**: Checkpointing + idempotent sinks.\n- **Failure Recovery**: Retries failed mini-batches (no output duplication).\n- **Stateful Operations**: Window aggregates, watermarks.\n\n---\n\n### **6. Machine Learning in Big Data**\n#### **Deep Learning (DL) in Spark**\n- **Challenges**:\n  - Large model sizes \u2192 slow loading.\n  - GPU costs for low-latency inference.\n- **Optimizations**:\n  - **Model Caching**: Avoid reloading (e.g., `model.eval()` in PyTorch UDFs).\n  - **Model Compression**: Smaller models for CPU execution.\n  - **Batch Processing**: Trade latency for cost (e.g., replace Spark Streaming with single-threaded Python).\n\n#### **ML Pipelines**\n- **Example**: Spider cam + AI models for real-time feedback.\n  - **Edge Computing**: Deploy models on-device (e.g., spider cam) to minimize latency.\n  - **Cloud Retraining**: Periodically update models (e.g., Google Cloud ML).\n\n---\n\n### **7. Performance Optimization**\n#### **Broadcast Variables**\n- **Use Case**: Small datasets (e.g., 1MB suspect locations file) shared across workers.\n- **Benefit**: Avoids shuffling (faster joins/filters).\n\n#### **Partitioning**\n- **Goal**: Evenly distribute data to avoid skew.\n- **Example**: Group by `IP address` in Spark to compute avg hits per customer.\n\n#### **Avoiding Driver Bottlenecks**\n- **Bad Practice**: Pulling all data to the driver (e.g., `take()` in Spark).\n- **Good Practice**: Use distributed operations (e.g., `groupBy`, `agg`).\n\n---\n\n### **8. Time Handling in ETL**\n- **Event Time**: When the event occurred (e.g., transaction timestamp).\n- **Processing Time**: When the system processes the event.\n- **Business Time**: Aligned with operational schedules (e.g., weekdays).\n- **Challenge**: Timezone/week definition changes (e.g., Middle East \u2192 India) require ETL rewrites.\n\n---\n\n### **9. Cost vs. Performance Trade-offs**\n| Scenario                          | High Performance (Costly)       | Cost-Optimized (Slower)          |\n|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| **DL Inference**                  | GPU + Spark Streaming           | CPU + Batch Processing           |\n| **Streaming**                     | Kafka + Spark Structured Streaming | Batch catch-up jobs          |\n| **Data Storage**                  | HDFS (distributed)              | Local FS (single-node)           |\n\n---\n\n## **Key Equations (Mathematics/Performance)**\n1. **MapReduce Shuffle Cost**:\n   - \\( \\text{Shuffle Size} = \\text{Map Output Size} \\times \\text{Reducers} \\)\n   - Minimize with combiners or broadcast joins.\n\n2. **Spark Partition Size**:\n   - Optimal partition size: **100MB\u20131GB** (avoid too many small partitions).\n\n3. **Streaming Lag**:\n   - \\( \\text{Lag} = \\text{Input Rate} - \\text{Processing Rate} \\)\n   - Scale Kafka brokers/partitions to reduce lag.\n\n4. **Model Latency**:\n   - \\( \\text{Inference Time} \\propto \\text{Model Size} \\)\n   - Compress models for CPU execution if latency is not critical.\n\n---\n\n## **Mermaid Knowledge Graphs**\n### **1.
