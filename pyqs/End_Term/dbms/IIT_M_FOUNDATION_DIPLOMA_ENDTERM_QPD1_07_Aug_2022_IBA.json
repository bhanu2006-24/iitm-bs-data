        "summary": "Here\u2019s a structured **summary of core topics, concepts, principles, and equations** essential for the **Diploma Level: Database Management Systems (DBMS)** exam, based on the provided question paper.\nThe summary is organized by **key themes**, followed by **Mermaid knowledge graphs** to visualize relationships.\n\n---\n\n## **1. Functional Dependencies & Normalization**\n### **Core Topics**\n- **Functional Dependencies (FDs):**\n  - Definition: A constraint between two sets of attributes in a relation (e.g., \\( X \\rightarrow Y \\) means \\( Y \\) is functionally dependent on \\( X \\)).\n  - Closure of FDs (\\( F^+ \\)): Compute all implied FDs from a given set \\( F \\).\n  - Minimal Cover: A minimal set of FDs equivalent to \\( F \\) with no redundant FDs or attributes.\n  - **Example (Q2, Q19, Q20):**\n    Given \\( \\mathcal{F} = \\{ AD \\rightarrow E, B \\rightarrow D, \\ldots \\} \\), compute candidate keys or check normal forms.\n\n- **Candidate Keys:**\n  - A minimal superkey (uniquely identifies tuples). Compute using FD closure.\n  - **Algorithm:**\n    1. Compute \\( X^+ \\) for all subsets \\( X \\) of attributes.\n    2. Check if \\( X^+ \\) includes all attributes of the relation.\n    3. Ensure minimality (no proper subset of \\( X \\) is a superkey).\n  - **Example (Q2):**\n    For \\( R1(A, B, C, E) \\), derive candidate keys from \\( \\mathcal{F} \\).\n\n- **Normal Forms (NFs):**\n  - **1NF:** Atomic values (no repeating groups).\n  - **2NF:** No partial dependencies (all non-prime attributes depend on the full candidate key).\n  - **3NF:** No transitive dependencies (non-prime attributes depend only on candidate keys).\n  - **BCNF:** For every FD \\( X \\rightarrow A \\), \\( X \\) must be a superkey.\n  - **4NF:** No multi-valued dependencies (MVDs) unless the left side is a superkey.\n  - **Example (Q7, Q19):**\n    - Decompose `players(Name, Team, Coach, Runs)` into 4NF (eliminate MVDs).\n    - Check if a relation is in 3NF but not BCNF (e.g., \\( \\{ AB \\rightarrow C, C \\rightarrow A \\} \\)).\n\n- **Decomposition:**\n  - **Lossless Join:** Ensure no spurious tuples after decomposition. Check using the **Chase Algorithm** or FD preservation.\n  - **Dependency Preservation:** All original FDs can be inferred from FDs in decomposed relations.\n  - **Example (Q20):**\n    Check if \\( R1(BC), R2(ABDE), R3(EG) \\) is lossless for \\( R(A, B, C, D, E, G) \\).\n\n---\n### **Key Equations/Algorithms**\n1. **Closure of FDs (\\( X^+ \\)):**\n   - Initialize \\( X^+ = X \\).\n   - Repeat: For each FD \\( Y \\rightarrow Z \\) in \\( F \\), if \\( Y \\subseteq X^+ \\), add \\( Z \\) to \\( X^+ \\).\n   - Stop when no more attributes can be added.\n\n2. **Candidate Key Check:**\n   - For a relation \\( R \\) with attributes \\( U \\), a set \\( K \\subseteq U \\) is a candidate key if:\n     - \\( K^+ = U \\) (closure includes all attributes).\n     - No proper subset of \\( K \\) satisfies this.\n\n3. **BCNF Violation Test:**\n   - For each FD \\( X \\rightarrow A \\), if \\( X \\) is not a superkey, the relation violates BCNF.\n\n4. **4NF Violation Test:**\n   - For a multi-valued dependency \\( X \\rightarrow\\rightarrow Y \\), if \\( X \\) is not a superkey, decompose into \\( R1(X, Y) \\) and \\( R2(X, Z) \\), where \\( Z = U - XY \\).\n\n---\n\n## **2. SQL & Relational Algebra**\n### **Core Topics**\n- **SQL Commands:**\n  - **DML (Data Manipulation Language):** `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `SELECT` (Q5, Q8, Q17, Q24).\n  - **DDL (Data Definition Language):** `CREATE TABLE`, `ALTER TABLE`, `DROP TABLE` (Q6).\n  - **TCL (Transaction Control Language):** `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`, `SAVEPOINT`.\n  - **DCL (Data Control Language):** `GRANT`, `REVOKE` (Q3).\n\n- **Joins & Subqueries:**\n  - **Natural Join (`NATURAL JOIN`):** Joins tables on common attributes (Q18).\n  - **Subqueries:** Nested `SELECT` statements (e.g., `WHERE EXISTS`, `IN`, `NOT IN`).\n  - **Set Operations:** `UNION`, `INTERSECT`, `EXCEPT` (Q24).\n\n- **Aggregation & Grouping:**\n  - `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`.\n\n- **String Patterns:**\n  - `LIKE` operator (e.g., `LIKE 'Ak%'`, `LIKE 'A__%'` for Q17).\n\n- **Transaction Isolation Levels:**\n  - `READ UNCOMMITTED`, `READ COMMITTED`, `REPEATABLE READ`, `SERIALIZABLE`.\n\n---\n### **Key SQL Examples**\n1. **Create Tables with Primary Keys (Q6):**\n   ```sql\n   CREATE TABLE student_dept (\n       roll_no INT PRIMARY KEY,\n       course VARCHAR(50),\n       section VARCHAR(10),\n       department VARCHAR(50)\n   );\n   ```\n\n2. **Grant Privileges (Q3):**\n   ```sql\n   GRANT DELETE, UPDATE ON table_name TO role_name;\n   ```\n\n3. **Pattern Matching (Q17):**\n   ```sql\n   SELECT customer_name\n   FROM customer\n   WHERE customer_name LIKE 'Ak%'\n   ORDER BY customer_name ASC\n   FETCH FIRST 3 ROWS ONLY;\n   ```\n\n4. **Subquery for EXCEPT (Q24):**\n   ```sql\n   SELECT music_name\n   FROM music\n   WHERE producer = 'YourFavMusic.com'\n   EXCEPT\n   SELECT music_name\n   FROM music\n   JOIN music_playback_singer ON music.music_id = music_playback_singer.music_id\n   JOIN singer ON singer.singer_id = music_playback_singer.singer_id\n   WHERE singer.singer_name = 'Lady Jaye';\n   ```\n\n5. **Natural Join (Q18):**\n   ```sql\n   SELECT p.name, t.points\n   FROM players p NATURAL JOIN teams t\n   WHERE p.jersey_no = 7;\n   ```\n\n---\n\n## **3. Transaction Management & Concurrency Control**\n### **Core Topics**\n- **ACID Properties:**\n  - **Atomicity:** All-or-nothing execution (using logs for undo/redo).\n  - **Consistency:** Preserves database constraints.\n  - **Isolation:** Transactions execute independently (serializability).\n  - **Durability:** Committed changes persist after failures.\n\n- **Transaction States:**\n  - Active, Partially Committed, Committed, Failed, Aborted.\n\n- **Logs & Recovery:**\n  - **Undo Log:** Rollback uncommitted transactions.\n  - **Redo Log:** Reapply committed transactions after a crash.\n  - **Checkpoints:** Periodic snapshots to reduce recovery time (Q21).\n  - **Immediate vs. Deferred Database Modification (Q23):**\n    - Immediate: Updates applied during transaction (requires undo/redo logs).\n    - Deferred: Updates applied at commit (only redo logs needed).\n\n- **Locking Protocols:**\n  - **Two-Phase Locking (2PL):**\n    - **Strict 2PL:** All locks held until commit (no cascading rollbacks, Q16).\n    - **Rigorous 2PL:** All locks held until commit + all unlocks after commit.\n  - **Deadlocks:** Detected using wait-for graphs.\n\n- **Schedule Types:**\n  - **Serializable:** Equivalent to a serial schedule.\n  - **Recoverable:** No transaction commits until all transactions it read from commit (Q22).\n  - **Cascadeless:** No transaction reads from an uncommitted transaction.\n  - **Conflict Serializability:** Swapping non-conflicting operations yields a serial schedule (Q9, Q25).\n\n---\n### **Key Equations/Algorithms**\n1. **Conflict Serializable Schedules:**\n   - Construct a **precedence graph** for a schedule \\( S \\):\n     - Nodes: Transactions \\( T_1, T_2, \\ldots \\).\n     - Edges: \\( T_i \\rightarrow T_j \\) if \\( T_i \\) performs an operation conflicting with \\( T_j \\)'s operation, and \\( T_i \\)'s operation comes first.\n   - If the graph is **acyclic**, \\( S \\) is conflict serializable.\n   - **Number of serial schedules:** For \\( n \\) transactions, there are \\( n! \\) possible serial schedules (Q25: \\( 4! = 24 \\)).\n\n2. **Recovery Actions (Q23):**\n   - **Immediate Modification:**\n     - **Undo:** Restore old values from log for uncommitted transactions.\n     - **Redo:** Reapply new values from log for committed transactions.\n   - **Deferred Modification:**\n     - Only **redo** is needed (no undo).\n\n3. **Lock Compatibility Matrix:**\n   |       | S (Shared) | X (Exclusive) |\n   |-------|------------|---------------|\n   | S     | Yes        | No            |\n   | X     | No         | No            |\n\n---\n\n## **4. Indexing & Storage**\n### **Core Topics**\n- **Index Types:**\n  - **Primary Index:** Built on the primary key (sparse or dense).\n  - **Secondary Index:** Built on non-key attributes (always dense).\n  - **Clustered Index:** Determines physical order of data (one per table).\n  - **Bitmap Index:** Efficient for low-cardinality attributes (Q11).\n  - **B-Tree Index:** Balanced tree for range queries (Q13).\n  - **Hash Index:** O(1) lookups (no range queries).\n\n- **RAID Levels:**\n  - **RAID-0:** Striping (no redundancy).\n  - **RAID-1:** Mirroring (100% redundancy).\n  - **RAID-4:** Dedicated parity disk (Q15).\n  - **RAID-5:** Distributed parity.\n\n- **Buffer Management:**\n  - **LRU (Least Recently Used):** Replace least recently accessed pages.\n\n---\n### **Key Equations**\n1. **Primary Sparse Index Blocks (Q12):**\n   - **Blocking Factor (bfr):** \\( \\text{bfr} = \\lfloor \\frac{\\text{Block Size}}{\\text{Record Size}} \\rfloor \\).\n   - **Number of Blocks:** \\( \\lceil \\frac{\\text{Total Records}}{\\text{bfr}} \\rceil \\).\n   - **Index Entries:** One per block (sparse).\n   - **Index Record Size:** \\( \\text{Search Key Size} + \\text{Block Pointer Size} \\).\n   - **Number of Index Blocks:** \\( \\lceil \\frac{\\text{Number of Data Blocks} \\times \\text{Index Record Size}}{\\text{Block Size}} \\rceil \\).\n   - **Example (Q12):**\n     - Records: 10,000, Block Size: 512, Record Size: 32 \u2192 \\( \\text{bfr} = 16 \\), Data Blocks = 625.\n     - Index Record Size: \\( 16 (\\text{key}) + 14 (\\text{pointer}) = 30 \\).\n     - Index Blocks: \\( \\lceil \\frac{625 \\times 30}{512} \\rceil = 37 \\).\n\n2. **Bitmap Index Size (Q11):**\n   - **Size per attribute value:** \\( \\lceil \\frac{\\text{Number of Records}}{\\text{Bits per Block}} \\rceil \\times \\text{Number of Blocks} \\).\n   - **Total Size:** Sum over all distinct values.\n   - **Example (Q11):**\n     - Records: \\( x \\), Values: 4 (Petrol, Diesel, CNG, Electric).\n     - Size: \\( 1000 \\) bytes \u2192 \\( x \\times 4 \\text{ bits} = 1000 \\times 8 \\) \u2192 \\( x = 2000 \\).\n\n3. **B-Tree Non-Leaf Node Record Pointer (Q13):**\n   - **Order \\( n \\):** Maximum \\( n-1 \\) keys per node.\n   - **Record Pointer Size:**\n     - For order 8, each non-leaf node has up to 7 keys and 8 pointers.\n     - **Block Size:** 1024 bytes.\n     - **Key Size:** 13 bytes (IMEI), **Tree Pointer Size:** 64 bytes.\n     - **Record Pointer Size:** \\( \\frac{1024 - (7 \\times 13 + 8 \\times 64)}{8} = 60 \\) bytes.\n\n---\n\n## **5. ER Diagrams & Schema Design**\n### **Core Topics**\n- **Entities & Attributes:**\n  - Strong vs. Weak entities.\n  - Simple vs. Composite vs. Derived attributes.\n\n- **Relationships:**\n  - **Cardinality:** 1:1, 1:N, M:N.\n  - **Participation:** Total vs. Partial.\n\n- **Weak Entity Sets:**\n  - Require a **discriminator** + partial key of the owner.\n\n- **Example (Q14):**\n  - **Instructor-Course:** M:N (an instructor can teach many courses; a course can have many instructors).\n  - **Health Information:** Weak entity (depends on `instructor`).\n\n---\n### **Key Rules**\n1. **M:N Relationships:** Resolve into a separate table with foreign keys.\n2. **Weak Entities:** Include the owner\u2019s primary key as a foreign key.\n\n---\n\n## **6. Security & Authorization**\n### **Core Topics**\n- **Privileges:**\n  - `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `ALL PRIVILEGES`.\n- **Roles:**\n  - Group privileges for easy management (Q3).\n- **Grant/Revoke:**\n  - `GRANT privilege ON object TO user/role [WITH GRANT OPTION]`.\n  - `REVOKE privilege ON object FROM user/role`.\n\n---\n### **Key Example (Q3)**\n```sql\nGRANT Department_Lead TO Employee1;  -- Inherits DELETE and UPDATE only.\n```\n\n---\n\n## **7. Query Optimization**\n### **Core Topics**\n- **Expression Trees:**\n  - Represent SQL queries as trees for optimization (Q10).\n  - Push selections (`\u03c3`) and projections (`\u03a0`) early to reduce intermediate results.\n- **Heuristics:**\n  - Perform selections before joins.\n  - Use smaller relations for joins first.\n\n---\n### **Key Example (Q10)**\nOptimized tree for:\n```sql\nSELECT name\nFROM instructor\nWHERE salary > 90000 AND building = 'Palmer';\n```\n```\n        \u03a0_name\n          |\n         \u2a1d (building='Palmer')\n        /       \\\n\u03c3_salary>90000   \u03c3_building='Palmer'\n      |                 |\n   instructor         department\n```\n\n---\n\n## **Mermaid Knowledge Graphs**\n### **Graph 1: Functional Dependencies & Normalization**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Functional Dependencies] --> B[Closure F+]\n    A --> C[Minimal Cover]\n    B --> D[Candidate Keys]\n    D --> E[Superkey]\n    D --> F[Minimality]\n    A --> G[Normal Forms]\n    G --> H[1NF: Atomic Values]\n    G --> I[2NF: No Partial Dependencies]\n    G --> J[3NF: No Transitive Dependencies]\n    G --> K[BCNF: X\u2192A implies X is Superkey]\n    G --> L[4NF: No Multi-Valued Dependencies]\n    D --> M[Decomposition]\n    M --> N[Lossless Join]\n    M --> O[Dependency Preservation]\n```\n\n### **Graph 2: SQL Commands & Relational Algebra**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[SQL] --> B[DML]\n    B --> B1[SELECT]\n    B --> B2[INSERT]\n    B --> B3[UPDATE]\n    B --> B4[DELETE]\n    A --> C[DDL]\n    C --> C1[CREATE TABLE]\n    C --> C2[ALTER TABLE]\n    C --> C3[DROP TABLE]\n    A --> D[TCL]\n    D --> D1[COMMIT]\n    D --> D2[ROLLBACK]\n    A --> E[DCL]\n    E --> E1[GRANT]\n    E --> E2[REVOKE]\n    A --> F[Relational Algebra]\n    F --> F1[Selection \u03c3]\n    F --> F2[Projection \u03a0]\n    F --> F3[Join \u2a1d]\n    F --> F4[Union \u222a]\n    F --> F5[Set Difference \u2212]\n```\n\n### **Graph 3: Transaction Management**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Transactions] --> B[ACID Properties]\n    B --> B1[Atomicity]\n    B --> B2[Consistency]\n    B --> B3[Isolation]\n    B --> B4[Durability]\n    A --> C[Recovery]\n    C --> C1[Undo Log]\n    C --> C2[Redo Log]\n    C --> C3[Checkpoints]\n    A --> D[Concurrency Control]\n    D --> D1[Locking]\n    D1 --> D1a[Shared Lock S]\n    D1 --> D1b[Exclusive Lock X]\n    D --> D2[Two-Phase Locking 2PL]\n    D2 --> D2a[Strict 2PL]\n    D2 --> D2b[Rigorous 2PL]\n    D --> D3[Deadlocks]\n    A --> E[Schedules]\n    E --> E1[Serializable]\n    E --> E2[Recoverable]\n    E --> E3[Conflict Serializable]\n    E --> E4[Precedence Graph]\n```\n\n### **Graph 4: Indexing & Storage**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Indexing] --> B[Primary Index]\n    A --> C[Secondary Index]\n    A --> D[Clustered Index]\n    A --> E[Bitmap Index]\n    A --> F[B-Tree]\n    F --> F1[Order n]\n    F --> F2[Balanced Tree]\n    A --> G[Hash Index]\n    A --> H[RAID Levels]\n    H --> H1[RAID-0: Striping]\n    H --> H2[RAID-1: Mirroring]\n    H --> H3[RAID-4: Parity Disk]\n    H --> H4[RAID-5: Distributed Parity]\n```\n\n### **Graph 5: ER Diagrams & Schema Design**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[ER Diagrams] --> B[Entities]\n    B --> B1[Strong Entity]\n    B --> B2[Weak Entity]\n    A --> C[Attributes]\n    C --> C1[Simple]\n    C --> C2[Composite]\n    C --> C3[Derived]\n    A --> D[Relationships]\n    D --> D1[Cardinality]\n    D1 --> D1a[1:1]\n    D1 --> D1b[1:N]\n    D1 --> D1c[M:N]\n    D --> D2[Participation]\n    D2 --> D2a[Total]\n    D2 --> D2b[Partial]\n    A --> E[Schema Design]\n    E --> E1[Resolve M:N]\n    E --> E2[Weak Entities]\n```\n\n### **Graph 6: Query Optimization**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Query Optimization] --> B[Expression Trees]\n    A --> C[Heuristics]\n    C --> C1[Push Selections Early]\n    C --> C2[Push Projections Early]\n    C --> C3[Join Smaller Relations First]\n    A --> D[Cost Estimation]\n    D --> D1[I/O Cost]\n    D --> D2[CPU Cost]\n    A --> E[Join Algorithms]\n    E --> E1[Nested Loop Join]\n    E --> E2[Hash Join]\n    E --> E3[Sort-Merge Join]\n```",
