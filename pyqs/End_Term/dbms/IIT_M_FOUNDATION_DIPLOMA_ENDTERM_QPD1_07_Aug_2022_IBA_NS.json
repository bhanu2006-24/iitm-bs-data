        "summary": "Here\u2019s a structured **summary of core topics, concepts, principles, and equations** essential for the **Database Management Systems (DBMS) exam**, along with **Mermaid knowledge graphs** to visualize relationships.\n\n---\n\n## **1. Core Topics & Concepts**\n### **A. Functional Dependencies & Normalization**\n#### **Key Concepts:**\n1. **Functional Dependency (FD):**\n   - Notation: \\( X \\rightarrow Y \\) (X functionally determines Y).\n   - **Closure of FDs (\\( F^+ \\))**: Set of all FDs derivable from \\( F \\).\n   - **Minimal Cover**: Irreducible set of FDs (no redundant FDs or attributes).\n   - **Candidate Keys**: Minimal superkeys (e.g., \\( AB \\) in \\( R(A,B,C) \\) if \\( AB \\rightarrow C \\) and no subset of \\( AB \\) determines \\( C \\)).\n\n2. **Normal Forms (NF):**\n   - **1NF**: Atomic values (no repeating groups).\n   - **2NF**: No partial dependencies (all non-prime attributes depend on the **full candidate key**).\n   - **3NF**: No transitive dependencies (non-prime attributes depend **only on the candidate key**).\n   - **BCNF**: For every \\( X \\rightarrow A \\), \\( X \\) must be a **superkey**.\n   - **4NF**: No multi-valued dependencies (MVDs) unless the left side is a superkey.\n\n3. **Decomposition:**\n   - **Lossless Join**: Decomposition preserves original data (checked via **common attributes** or **FD closure**).\n   - **Dependency Preservation**: All original FDs can be inferred from the decomposed relations.\n\n#### **Key Equations/Algorithms:**\n- **Closure of Attributes (\\( X^+ \\))**:\n  - Start with \\( X \\), repeatedly apply FDs until no new attributes can be added.\n  - Example: For \\( F = \\{AB \\rightarrow C, B \\rightarrow D\\} \\), \\( (AB)^+ = ABCD \\).\n- **Candidate Key Check**:\n  - Compute \\( X^+ \\) for all subsets \\( X \\) of attributes. If \\( X^+ \\) includes all attributes, \\( X \\) is a candidate key.\n- **Lossless Join Test**:\n  - Compute \\( (R1 \\cap R2)^+ \\) (common attributes). If it includes a candidate key of \\( R1 \\) or \\( R2 \\), the decomposition is lossless.\n\n#### **Example (Q2, Q7, Q19, Q20):**\n- **Q2**: Find candidate keys for \\( R1(A,B,C,E) \\) given \\( \\mathcal{F} \\).\n  - Compute closures: \\( A^+ = A \\), \\( B^+ = BD \\), \\( AB^+ = ABCDE \\), etc.\n  - Candidate keys: \\( AB \\), \\( BC \\).\n- **Q7**: Decompose `players` into 4NF (multi-valued dependency on `Name` and `Team`).\n- **Q19**: Check if \\( R \\) is in 3NF but not BCNF (e.g., \\( \\{AB \\rightarrow CD, C \\rightarrow A\\} \\)).\n- **Q20**: Test lossless join for \\( R1(BC) \\), \\( R2(ABDE) \\), \\( R3(EG) \\).\n\n---\n\n### **B. Transaction Management & Concurrency Control**\n#### **Key Concepts:**\n1. **ACID Properties**:\n   - **Atomicity**: All-or-nothing execution.\n   - **Consistency**: Preserves database constraints.\n   - **Isolation**: Transactions execute independently.\n   - **Durability**: Committed changes persist.\n\n2. **Schedule Types**:\n   - **Serial Schedule**: Transactions execute sequentially.\n   - **Serializable Schedule**: Equivalent to some serial schedule.\n   - **Conflict Serializable**: Swapping non-conflicting operations preserves equivalence.\n   - **View Serializable**: Final state matches a serial schedule.\n\n3. **Locking Protocols**:\n   - **Two-Phase Locking (2PL)**:\n     - **Growing Phase**: Acquire locks.\n     - **Shrinking Phase**: Release locks.\n   - **Strict 2PL**: All locks held until commit.\n   - **Rigorous 2PL**: All locks held until commit + no new locks after first unlock.\n\n4. **Recovery Techniques**:\n   - **Log Records**: `<T, start>`, `<T, X, old, new>`, `<T, commit/abort>`.\n   - **Undo/Redo**:\n     - **Undo**: Rollback uncommitted transactions (use `old` value).\n     - **Redo**: Reapply committed transactions (use `new` value).\n   - **Checkpointing**: Periodically save database state to reduce recovery time.\n\n#### **Key Equations/Algorithms:**\n- **Conflict Serializability Test**:\n  - Build a **precedence graph**. If no cycles, the schedule is conflict-serializable.\n- **Recovery Rules (Q4, Q22, Q23):**\n  - **Undo**: If `<T, start>` exists but no `<T, commit>`, undo \\( T \\).\n  - **Redo**: If `<T, commit>` exists, redo \\( T \\).\n- **Number of Serial Schedules**:\n  - For \\( n \\) transactions, there are \\( n! \\) serial schedules.\n\n#### **Example (Q4, Q9, Q16, Q22, Q23, Q25):**\n- **Q4**: Identify correct recovery statements (e.g., redo only if `<T, commit>` exists).\n- **Q9**: Count conflict-serializable schedules (4 for \\( T1, T2, T3, T4 \\)).\n- **Q16**: Check if schedules follow **Strict 2PL** (e.g., \\( S2 \\) holds locks until commit).\n- **Q22**: Determine if a schedule is **recoverable/cascadeless**.\n- **Q23**: Recover from logs (immediate vs. deferred modification).\n- **Q25**: Count serial schedules (24 for 4 transactions).\n\n---\n\n### **C. SQL & Relational Algebra**\n#### **Key Concepts:**\n1. **SQL Commands**:\n   - **DML**: `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`.\n   - **DDL**: `CREATE`, `ALTER`, `DROP`.\n   - **TCL**: `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`.\n   - **DCL**: `GRANT`, `REVOKE`.\n\n2. **Joins & Subqueries**:\n   - **Natural Join**: Matches attributes with the same name.\n   - **Outer Join**: Includes non-matching rows (`LEFT`, `RIGHT`, `FULL`).\n   - **Subqueries**: Nested `SELECT` statements (e.g., `WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM instructor)`).\n\n3. **Aggregation & Grouping**:\n   - `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`.\n\n4. **String Patterns**:\n   - `LIKE` (e.g., `LIKE 'Ak%'`, `LIKE '_a%'`).\n\n#### **Key Equations/Algorithms:**\n- **Relational Algebra Trees (Q10)**:\n  - Optimize by pushing selections (`\u03c3`) and projections (`\u03a0`) down the tree.\n- **SQL Query Optimization**:\n  - Use indexes on `WHERE`/`JOIN` attributes.\n\n#### **Example (Q5, Q6, Q8, Q10, Q17, Q18, Q24):**\n- **Q5**: `INSERT` uses **DML**.\n- **Q6**: Create tables with **primary keys** based on FDs.\n- **Q8**: `WHERE quantity <= 5 ORDER BY value DESC`.\n- **Q10**: Optimize expression tree (push `\u03c3` early).\n- **Q17**: `LIKE 'Ak%' ORDER BY customer_name ASC`.\n- **Q18**: Convert SQL to **TRC/DRC**.\n- **Q24**: Use `EXCEPT` or `NOT IN` for anti-joins.\n\n---\n\n### **D. Indexing & Storage**\n#### **Key Concepts:**\n1. **Index Types**:\n   - **Primary Index**: Sparse (one entry per block).\n   - **Secondary Index**: Dense (one entry per record).\n   - **Bitmap Index**: Bit vectors for low-cardinality attributes.\n   - **B-Tree**: Balanced tree with \\( n \\) keys per node (order \\( p \\)).\n   - **B+ Tree**: All keys in leaves, linked for range queries.\n\n2. **RAID Levels**:\n   - **RAID-0**: Striping (no redundancy).\n   - **RAID-1**: Mirroring (100% redundancy).\n   - **RAID-4**: Dedicated parity disk.\n   - **RAID-5**: Distributed parity.\n\n3. **Buffer Management**:\n   - **LRU (Least Recently Used)**: Replace least recently accessed blocks.\n\n#### **Key Equations:**\n- **B-Tree Order \\( p \\)**:\n  - Non-leaf node: \\( p-1 \\) keys, \\( p \\) pointers.\n  - Leaf node: \\( p-1 \\) to \\( 2p-1 \\) keys.\n- **Index Size Calculations (Q11, Q12, Q13)**:\n  - **Bitmap Index**: \\( \\text{Size} = \\text{Number of records} \\times \\text{Number of distinct values} \\).\n  - **Sparse Index**: \\( \\text{Entries} = \\frac{\\text{Total records}}{\\text{Blocking factor}} \\).\n  - **B-Tree Non-Leaf Node**:\n    - \\( \\text{Record pointer size} = \\text{Block size} - (\\text{Key size} + \\text{Tree pointer size}) \\times (p-1) \\).\n\n#### **Example (Q11, Q12, Q13, Q15):**\n- **Q11**: Bitmap index size = 1000 bytes, 4 values \u2192 \\( x = 2000 \\).\n- **Q12**: Sparse index blocks = \\( \\lceil \\frac{10000 \\text{ records}}{16 \\text{ records/block}} \\rceil = 625 \\), but **37** index blocks (since \\( \\frac{625}{17} \\approx 37 \\)).\n- **Q13**: B-Tree non-leaf node: \\( 1024 - (13 + 64) \\times 7 = 60 \\) bytes.\n- **Q15**: RAID-4 parity recovery (XOR of other disks).\n\n---\n\n### **E. ER Diagrams & Schema Design**\n#### **Key Concepts:**\n1. **ER Components**:\n   - **Entities**: Rectangles (e.g., `instructor`, `course`).\n   - **Attributes**: Ovals (e.g., `name`, `salary`).\n   - **Relationships**: Diamonds (e.g., `teaches`).\n   - **Cardinality**: 1:1, 1:N, M:N.\n   - **Weak Entities**: Double rectangles (existence-dependent).\n\n2. **Schema Design**:\n   - Convert ER to relational tables (entities \u2192 tables, relationships \u2192 foreign keys).\n   - Handle **M:N** relationships with a **junction table**.\n\n#### **Example (Q14):**\n- **Q14**: ER diagram for `instructor`\u2013`course` (M:N with `manages`) and `health` (weak entity).\n\n---\n\n### **F. Security & Authorization**\n#### **Key Concepts:**\n1. **Privileges**:\n   - `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`.\n2. **Roles**:\n   - `GRANT role TO user` (inherits privileges).\n3. **SQL Commands**:\n   - `GRANT SELECT ON table TO user`.\n   - `REVOKE DELETE ON table FROM user`.\n\n#### **Example (Q3):**\n- **Q3**: `GRANT Department_Lead TO Employee1` \u2192 inherits `DELETE`/`UPDATE`.\n\n---\n\n## **2.
