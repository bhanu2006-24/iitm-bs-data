        "summary": "Here\u2019s a structured **summary of core topics, concepts, principles, and equations** for the **Reinforcement Learning (RL) exam**, followed by **Mermaid knowledge graphs** to visualize relationships.\n\n---\n\n## **Core Topics & Key Concepts**\n### **1. Multi-Armed Bandits (MAB)**\n- **Exploration vs. Exploitation**:\n  - **\u03b5-greedy**: Chooses random action with probability \u03b5, else greedy.\n  - **UCB (Upper Confidence Bound)**: Balances exploration/exploitation using confidence intervals.\n- **Regret Minimization**:\n  - UCB minimizes regret better than \u03b5-greedy because \u03b5-greedy keeps a constant probability of choosing suboptimal arms.\n- **Softmax Policy for MAB**:\n  - Update rule for policy parameters (\u03b8) in gradient bandit:\n    \\[\n    \\Delta \\theta_i =\n    \\begin{cases}\n    \\alpha (r - \\bar{r})(1 - \\pi(a_i, \\theta)) & \\text{if action } a_i \\text{ is chosen}, \\\\\n    \\alpha (r - \\bar{r})(-\\pi(a_i, \\theta)) & \\text{otherwise}.\n    \\end{cases}\n    \\]\n\n---\n\n### **2. Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)**\n- **Bellman Equations**:\n  - **Value Function**: \\( V(s) = \\max_a \\sum_{s'} P(s'|s,a) [R(s,a,s') + \\gamma V(s')] \\)\n  - **Q-Function**: \\( Q(s,a) = \\sum_{s'} P(s'|s,a) [R(s,a,s') + \\gamma \\max_{a'} Q(s',a')] \\)\n- **Policy Iteration**:\n  - **Policy Evaluation**: Iteratively compute \\( V^\\pi \\) using Bellman equation.\n  - **Policy Improvement**: Update policy greedily w.r.t. \\( Q^\\pi \\).\n  - **Convergence**: Random tie-breaking may cause oscillations but still converges.\n- **Real-Time Dynamic Programming (RTDP)**: On-policy trajectory-sampling version of **Value Iteration**.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Temporal Difference (TD) Learning**\n- **TD(0) Update**:\n  \\[\n  V(s) \\leftarrow V(s) + \\alpha [r + \\gamma V(s') - V(s)]\n  \\]\n- **TD(\u03bb) (Eligibility Traces)**:\n  - **Accumulating Traces**: \\( e_t(s) = \\gamma \\lambda e_{t-1}(s) + \\nabla V(s) \\)\n  - **Replacing Traces**: Reset trace to 1 when state is visited.\n  - **\u03bb-Return**: \\( G_t^\\lambda = (1 - \\lambda) \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\lambda^{n-1} G_t^n \\)\n- **SARSA (On-Policy TD Control)**:\n  \\[\n  Q(s,a) \\leftarrow Q(s,a) + \\alpha [r + \\gamma Q(s',a') - Q(s,a)]\n  \\]\n- **Q-Learning (Off-Policy TD Control)**:\n  \\[\n  Q(s,a) \\leftarrow Q(s,a) + \\alpha [r + \\gamma \\max_{a'} Q(s',a') - Q(s,a)]\n  \\]\n\n---\n\n### **4. Monte Carlo (MC) Methods**\n- **First-Visit vs. Every-Visit**:\n  - **First-Visit**: Average returns only for the first occurrence of a state in an episode.\n  - **Every-Visit**: Average returns for all occurrences (increases **bias**).\n- **MC Control (Policy Gradient)**:\n  \\[\n  \\theta_{t+1} \\leftarrow \\theta_t + \\alpha G_t \\frac{\\nabla \\pi(A_t|S_t, \\theta_t)}{\\pi(A_t|S_t, \\theta_t)}\n  \\]\n\n---\n\n### **5. Function Approximation & Deep RL**\n- **Actor-Critic Methods**:\n  - **Critic**: Estimates \\( V(s) \\) or \\( Q(s,a) \\).\n  - **Actor**: Updates policy using gradient:\n    \\[\n    \\theta_{t+1} \\leftarrow \\theta_t + \\alpha (G_{t:t+1} - \\hat{v}(S_t, w)) \\frac{\\nabla \\pi(A_t | S_t, \\theta_t)}{\\pi(A_t | S_t, \\theta_t)}\n    \\]\n- **Deep Q-Networks (DQN)**:\n  - **Output Layer**: Linear (no ReLU/sigmoid) because Q-values can be any real number.\n  - **Experience Replay**: Stores transitions to break temporal correlations.\n- **Policy Search Methods**:\n  - Advantages:\n    - Simpler solution description.\n    - Better convergence with function approximation.\n    - Works well in continuous action spaces.\n    - Robust to partial observability.\n\n---\n\n### **6. Semi-Markov Decision Processes (SMDPs)**\n- **Options**: Temporal abstractions (e.g., \"go to door\" instead of individual steps).\n- **SMDP Q-Learning**:\n  - If \\( \\tau \\) (option duration) is fixed, converges to same policy as standard Q-learning **only when \\( \\tau = 1 \\)**.\n\n---\n\n### **7. Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)**\n- **Steps in Order**: **Selection \u2192 Expansion \u2192 Simulation \u2192 Backup**.\n- **UCT (Upper Confidence Bound for Trees)**:\n  - Modifies **Selection** step to balance exploration/exploitation.\n- **Rollout Policy**: Used in **Simulation** to estimate action values (not full \\( q^* \\)).\n\n---\n\n### **8. Exploration Strategies in Grid Worlds**\n- **Reward Shaping for Shortest Path**:\n  - Works with:\n    - **+10 goal reward, -1 step penalty**.\n    - **0 goal reward, -1 step penalty**.\n    - **+1 goal reward with \u03b3 = 0.9 or 0.1** (but not \u03b3 = 0).\n\n---\n\n## **Key Equations Summary**\n| **Concept**               | **Equation**                                                                 |\n|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **UCB**                   | \\( A_t = \\argmax_a \\left( Q_t(a) + c \\sqrt{\\frac{\\ln t}{N_t(a)}} \\right) \\) |\n| **TD(0) Update**          | \\( V(s) \\leftarrow V(s) + \\alpha [r + \\gamma V(s') - V(s)] \\)               |\n| **Q-Learning Update**     | \\( Q(s,a) \\leftarrow Q(s,a) + \\alpha [r + \\gamma \\max_a Q(s',a) - Q(s,a)] \\) |\n| **SARSA Update**          | \\( Q(s,a) \\leftarrow Q(s,a) + \\alpha [r + \\gamma Q(s',a') - Q(s,a)] \\)     |\n| **Policy Gradient (REINFORCE)** | \\( \\theta \\leftarrow \\theta + \\alpha G_t \\nabla \\log \\pi(a|s,\\theta) \\) |\n| **Actor-Critic Update**   | \\( \\theta \\leftarrow \\theta + \\alpha \\delta \\nabla \\log \\pi(a|s,\\theta) \\) |\n| **\u03bb-Return**              | \\( G_t^\\lambda = (1-\\lambda) \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\lambda^{n-1} G_t^n \\)      |\n| **Eligibility Trace (Accumulating)** | \\( e_t(s) = \\gamma \\lambda e_{t-1}(s) + \\nabla V(s) \\) |\n\n---\n\n## **Mermaid Knowledge Graphs**\n### **Graph 1: Core RL Algorithms & Relationships**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Reinforcement Learning] --> B[Model-Based]\n    A --> C[Model-Free]\n    B --> D[Dynamic Programming]\n    B --> E[Monte Carlo Tree Search]\n    C --> F[Temporal Difference]\n    C --> G[Monte Carlo]\n    F --> H[Q-Learning]\n    F --> I[SARSA]\n    F --> J[TD Lambda]\n    G --> K[First-Visit MC]\n    G --> L[Every-Visit MC]\n    D --> M[Policy Iteration]\n    D --> N[Value Iteration]\n    E --> O[UCT]\n    H --> P[DQN]\n    I --> Q[Expected SARSA]\n```\n\n### **Graph 2: Policy Gradient & Actor-Critic**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Policy Optimization] --> B[Policy Gradient]\n    A --> C[Actor-Critic]\n    B --> D[REINFORCE]\n    B --> E[Monte Carlo Policy Gradient]\n    C --> F[Advantage Actor-Critic]\n    C --> G[Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient]\n    D --> H[\"\u03b8 \u2190 \u03b8 + \u03b1 G_t \u2207 log \u03c0(a|s,\u03b8)\"]\n    F --> I[\"Critic: V(s) or Q(s,a)\"]\n    F --> J[\"Actor: \u03c0(a|s,\u03b8)\"]\n```\n\n### **Graph 3: Exploration vs. Exploitation**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Exploration vs. Exploitation] --> B[\u03b5-Greedy]\n    A --> C[UCB]\n    A --> D[Thompson Sampling]\n    B --> E[\"Random action with prob \u03b5\"]\n    C --> F[\"Balances with confidence intervals\"]\n    D --> G[\"Bayesian approach\"]\n```\n\n### **Graph 4: MCTS Workflow**\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n    A[Selection] --> B[Expansion]\n    B --> C[Simulation]\n    C --> D[Backup]\n    D --> A\n```\n\n### **Graph 5: TD Learning Family**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[TD Learning] --> B[TD(0)]\n    A --> C[TD(\u03bb)]\n    A --> D[SARSA]\n    A --> E[Q-Learning]\n    C --> F[Eligibility Traces]\n    D --> G[On-Policy]\n    E --> H[Off-Policy]\n```\n\n---\n## **Exam Tips**\n1. **Focus on Equations**: TD updates, Q-Learning, Policy Gradient, and \u03bb-Return are **high-yield**.\n2. **Algorithmic Differences**:\n   - **On-Policy (SARSA) vs. Off-Policy (Q-Learning)**.\n   - **MCTS Steps Order**: Selection \u2192 Expansion \u2192 Simulation \u2192 Backup.\n3. **Exploration Strategies**: UCB > \u03b5-greedy for regret minimization.\n4. **Function Approximation**: DQN uses **linear output layer** (no ReLU/sigmoid).\n5. **SMDP**: Only converges to same policy as Q-Learning when \\( \\tau = 1 \\).",
