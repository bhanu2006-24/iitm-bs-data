Core Topics & Concepts**\n### **A. Fundamentals of RL**\n1. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**\n   - Exploratory actions are critical in stochastic environments (Q3).\n   - **\u03b5-greedy, Softmax, UCB** (Upper Confidence Bound) for balancing exploration/exploitation.\n\n2. **Markov Decision Process (MDP)**\n   - States, actions, rewards, transition probabilities, discount factor (\u03b3).\n   - **Bellman Equations** (for \\( V(s) \\) and \\( Q(s,a) \\)):\n     \\[\n     V(s) = \\sum_a \\pi(a|s) \\sum_{s',r} P(s'|s,a) [r + \\gamma V(s')]\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     Q(s,a) = \\sum_{s',r} P(s'|s,a) [r + \\gamma \\max_{a'} Q(s',a')]\n     \\]\n\n3. **Policies & Optimality**\n   - **Optimal Policy (\u03c0*)**: Maximizes expected return.\n   - **Value Function (V\u03c0, Q\u03c0)**: Expected return under policy \u03c0.\n   - **Advantage Function (A\u03c0)** (Q5):\n     \\[\n     A_\\pi(s,a) = Q_\\pi(s,a) - V_\\pi(s)\n     \\]\n   - If two policies (\u03c0, \u03c0\u2019) are optimal, their value functions are equal (Q19).\n\n---\n\n### **B. Dynamic Programming (DP)**\n1. **Bootstrapping & Backups**\n   - **DP**: Bootstraps (uses estimates), full backups (updates all states) (Q4).\n   - **Policy Evaluation**: Iterative update of \\( V(s) \\).\n   - **Policy Improvement**: Greedy update using \\( Q(s,a) \\).\n\n2. **Value Iteration & Policy Iteration**\n   - **Generalized Policy Iteration (GPI)** (Q25):\n     - Alternates between **policy evaluation** (update \\( V \\)) and **policy improvement** (update \u03c0).\n     - **Asynchronous DP** is a form of GPI.\n\n---\n\n### **C. Monte Carlo (MC) Methods**\n1. **First-Visit vs. Every-Visit MC** (Q31, Q32)\n   - **First-Visit**: Average return for the **first time** a state is visited in an episode.\n   - **Every-Visit**: Average return for **every visit** to a state.\n   - Example (Q31, Q32):\n     - First-visit estimate for a 10-step episode with return 10: **10**.\n     - Every-visit estimate: **5.5** (average over all visits).\n\n2. **MC Control (Policy Iteration)**\n   - **On-Policy (e.g., REINFORCE)**: Learns the policy being executed.\n   - **Off-Policy (e.g., Q-Learning)**: Learns a target policy while following another.\n\n3. **MC Policy Gradient with Baseline** (Q22)\n   - Replace \\( Q_\\pi(S_t, A_t) \\) with **actual return \\( G_t \\)**.\n   - Baseline reduces variance (Q16):\n     \\[\n     \\nabla J(\\theta) \\propto \\sum_s \\mu(s) \\sum_a (Q_\\pi(s,a) - b(s)) \\nabla \\pi(a|s,\\theta)\n     \\]\n\n---\n\n### **D. Temporal Difference (TD) Learning**\n1. **TD(0) vs. MC vs. TD(\u03bb)**\n   - **TD(0)**: Bootstraps (updates online), sample backups.\n   - **MC**: No bootstrapping, waits for episode end.\n   - **TD(\u03bb)**: Combines TD and MC using **eligibility traces** (Q8, Q26).\n     - **Forward View**: Updates based on future rewards.\n     - **Backward View**: Uses eligibility traces to assign credit to past actions.\n     - **Accumulating Traces** (Q8):\n       \\[\n       e_t(s) =\n       \\begin{cases}\n       \\gamma \\lambda e_{t-1}(s) & \\text{if } s \\neq s_t \\\\\n       \\gamma \\lambda e_{t-1}(s) + 1 & \\text{if } s = s_t\n       \\end{cases}\n       \\]\n\n2. **SARSA vs. Q-Learning** (Q11, Q21)\n   - **SARSA**: On-policy, TD-control.\n   - **Q-Learning**: Off-policy, suffers from **maximization bias** (overestimates Q-values).\n   - **Double Q-Learning**: Reduces bias by using two Q-functions.\n\n3. **TD(\u03bb) Behavior** (Q9)\n   - When **\u03bb = 1**, TD(\u03bb) behaves like **MC** (but updates incrementally).\n   - When **\u03bb = 0**, it behaves like **TD(0)**.\n\n---\n\n### **E. Function Approximation & Deep RL**\n1. **State Aggregation** (Q10)\n   - Assumes nearby states have similar values.\n   - **Breaks down** when states near borders (but in the same cell) have different values.\n\n2. **Deep Q-Networks (DQN)** (Q12)\n   - **Target Network**: Updates slower than the online network to stabilize training.\n   - **Experience Replay**: Breaks temporal correlations.\n\n3. **Policy Gradient Methods** (Q13, Q14, Q15, Q16)\n   - **REINFORCE**: Monte Carlo policy gradient.\n   - **Policy Gradient Theorem**:\n     \\[\n     \\nabla J(\\theta) \\propto \\sum_s \\mu(s) \\sum_a Q_\\pi(s,a) \\nabla \\pi(a|s,\\theta)\n     \\]\n   - **Baseline**: Subtracts a baseline \\( b(s) \\) to reduce variance (Q16).\n   - **Multi-Arm Bandit Cost Function** (Q14):\n     \\[\n     J(\\theta) = \\sum_a Q^*(a) \\pi_\\theta(a)\n     \\]\n   - **Gradient Estimation from Samples** (Q15):\n     \\[\n     \\hat{\\nabla} J(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N r_i \\frac{\\nabla \\pi_\\theta(a_i)}{\\pi_\\theta(a_i)}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Actor-Critic Methods (A3C)** (Q23)\n   - **Parallel Processing**: Multiple agents update a shared policy.\n   - **N-step TD Error**: Used for updates.\n   - **Small Updates**: Individual learners contribute small gradient updates.\n\n---\n\n### **F. Advanced Topics**\n1. **Options & Semi-Markov Options** (Q27, Q28)\n   - **Option**: Temporal abstraction (initiation set, policy, termination condition).\n   - **Markov Option**: Policy depends only on the current state.\n   - **Semi-Markov Option**: Policy may depend on history since option execution began.\n\n2. **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)** (Q17, Q24)\n   - **UCT (Upper Confidence Bound for Trees)** (Q17):\n     \\[\n     \\argmax_a \\left[ Q(s,a) + 2c \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\ln N(s)}{N(s,a)}} \\right]\n     \\]\n   - **Characteristics**: Anytime, heuristic-based.\n\n3. **Hierarchical RL & Reusability** (Q6)\n   - **Recursive Optimal**: Maximizes reusability of sub-policies.\n\n4. **Influence Maximization in Networks** (Q18)\n   - **RL Formulation**:\n     - **State**: Discovered graph \\( G_t \\).\n     - **Action**: Query nodes in \\( G_t \\).\n     - **Reward**: Based on influenced nodes in \\( G^* \\) after discovery.\n\n---\n\n## **2.
