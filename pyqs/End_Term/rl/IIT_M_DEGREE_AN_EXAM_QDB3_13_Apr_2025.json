        "summary": "Here\u2019s a structured **summary of core topics, concepts, principles, and equations** for the **Reinforcement Learning (RL) exam**, along with **Mermaid knowledge graphs** to visualize relationships.\n\n---\n\n---\n\n### **1. Core Topics & Concepts**\n#### **A. Fundamentals of RL**\n1. **RL vs. Supervised/Unsupervised Learning**\n   - RL is **not unsupervised** (Question 3).\n   - Key difference: RL maximizes **cumulative reward** (no labels, but feedback via rewards).\n   - **Equation**:\n     \\[\n     G_t = \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\gamma^k R_{t+k+1}\n     \\]\n     where \\(G_t\\) = return, \\(\\gamma\\) = discount factor, \\(R\\) = reward.\n\n2. **Markov Decision Process (MDP)**\n   - Defined by \\((S, A, P, R, \\gamma)\\):\n     - \\(S\\): State space.\n     - \\(A\\): Action space.\n     - \\(P(s'|s,a)\\): Transition probability.\n     - \\(R(s,a,s')\\): Reward function.\n     - \\(\\gamma\\): Discount factor.\n   - **Bellman Equation** (for \\(v_\\pi(s)\\)):\n     \\[\n     v_\\pi(s) = \\sum_a \\pi(a|s) \\sum_{s',r} P(s',r|s,a) [r + \\gamma v_\\pi(s')]\n     \\]\n   - **Example**: Question 11 (equiprobable random policy in a grid MDP).\n\n---\n\n#### **B. Value-Based Methods**\n1. **Monte Carlo (MC) vs. Temporal Difference (TD) Learning**\n   - **MC**:\n     - Updates **after full episode** (unbiased but high variance).\n     - **Equation**:\n       \\[\n       V(S_t) \\leftarrow V(S_t) + \\alpha [G_t - V(S_t)]\n       \\]\n   - **TD(0)**:\n     - Updates **online** (biased but low variance).\n     - **Equation**:\n       \\[\n       V(S_t) \\leftarrow V(S_t) + \\alpha [R_{t+1} + \\gamma V(S_{t+1}) - V(S_t)]\n       \\]\n   - **Key Difference**: MC is unbiased; TD may introduce bias (Question 4).\n\n2. **Q-Learning**\n   - Off-policy TD control.\n   - **Equation**:\n     \\[\n     Q(S_t, A_t) \\leftarrow Q(S_t, A_t) + \\alpha [R_{t+1} + \\gamma \\max_a Q(S_{t+1}, a) - Q(S_t, A_t)]\n     \\]\n   - **Maximization Bias**: Overestimates Q-values in stochastic environments (Question 5).\n     - Solution: **Double Q-Learning**.\n\n3. **SARSA**\n   - On-policy TD control.\n   - **Equation**:\n     \\[\n     Q(S_t, A_t) \\leftarrow Q(S_t, A_t) + \\alpha [R_{t+1} + \\gamma Q(S_{t+1}, A_{t+1}) - Q(S_t, A_t)]\n     \\]\n   - **Expected SARSA**: Uses expected value of next action (better for stochastic environments, Question 7).\n\n4. **Upper Confidence Bound (UCB)**\n   - Balances exploration/exploitation.\n   - **Equation**:\n     \\[\n     A_t = \\arg\\max_a \\left[ Q_t(a) + c \\sqrt{\\frac{\\ln t}{N_t(a)}} \\right]\n     \\]\n   - **Key Property**: Confidence intervals shrink with more samples (Question 6).\n\n---\n\n#### **C. Policy-Based Methods**\n1. **Policy Gradient Theorem**\n   - **Equation**:\n     \\[\n     \\nabla J(\\theta) \\propto \\sum_s \\mu(s) \\sum_a Q_\\pi(s,a) \\nabla \\pi(a|s,\\theta)\n     \\]\n   - **REINFORCE with Baseline**:\n     - Baseline \\(b\\) can be **state-dependent** or **constant** (Question 10).\n     - Reduces variance without introducing bias if \\(b\\) is independent of \\(a\\).\n\n2. **Actor-Critic Methods**\n   - **Actor**: Policy \\(\\pi(a|s,\\theta)\\).\n   - **Critic**: Value function \\(V(s)\\) or \\(Q(s,a)\\).\n   - **TD Target in Actor-Critic**:\n     - Replaces \\(G_t\\) with \\(R_{t+1} + \\gamma V(S_{t+1})\\).\n     - **Effect**: Reduces variance but may introduce bias (Question 9).\n\n---\n\n#### **D. Advanced Topics**\n1. **Generalized Policy Iteration (GPI)**\n   - Combines **policy evaluation** and **policy improvement**.\n   - Examples:\n     - Value Iteration (Question 8).\n     - Q-Learning/SARSA.\n     - Monte Carlo Control.\n\n2. **Function Approximation (Deep RL)**\n   - **Deep Q-Network (DQN)**:\n     - Uses neural networks to approximate \\(Q(s,a)\\).\n     - **Experience Replay**: Stabilizes training (Question 12\u201316).\n   - **Hierarchical RL**:\n     - Decomposes tasks into sub-goals (e.g., \"Goto A\" \u2192 \"Goto B\" \u2192 \"End\").\n     - **Optimal Policies**:\n       - **Flat Optimal**: Shortest path (Question 20).\n       - **Recursively Optimal**: Follows hierarchy (Question 19).\n\n3. **Exploration Strategies**\n   - **\\(\\epsilon\\)-Greedy**:\n     - Probability of exploration = \\(\\epsilon\\).\n     - **Example**: Question 16 (\\(\\epsilon = 0.06\\)).\n   - **Rollout Algorithms**:\n     - Simulates trajectories to estimate \\(Q(s,a)\\).\n     - **Example**: Question 17\u201318 (comparing \\(a_1\\) and \\(a_2\\)).\n\n---\n\n#### **E.

Exam-Specific Tips**\n1. **Numerical Questions**:\n   - **MDP Value Iteration** (Question 11): Solve Bellman equations for \\(v_\\pi(s)\\).\n   - **DQN Forward Pass** (Questions 12\u201315): Compute ReLU activations and Q-values step-by-step.\n   - **Rollout Returns** (Questions 17\u201318): Simulate trajectories and sum rewards.\n\n2. **Theoretical Questions**:\n   - **MC vs. TD** (Question 4): Focus on bias/variance trade-offs.\n   - **Maximization Bias** (Question 5): Know how it affects Q-learning.\n   - **UCB** (Question 6): Understand confidence interval behavior.\n   - **Expected SARSA** (Question 7): Why it\u2019s better for stochastic environments.\n\n3. **Algorithmic Questions**:\n   - **Policy Gradient** (Question 10): Baseline properties.\n   - **Actor-Critic** (Question 9): TD target\u2019s effect on variance/bias.\n   - **Hierarchical RL** (Questions 19\u201321): Compare flat vs. hierarchical policies.\n\n4. **Diagram-Based Questions**:\n   - **Grid Worlds** (Questions 19\u201321): Trace routes and count time-steps.\n   - **DQN Architecture** (Questions 12\u201316): Follow weights and activations.\n\n---\n### **4. Common Pitfalls**\n- **Misclassifying RL**: RL is **not unsupervised** (Question 3).\n- **Confusing MC/TD**: MC uses full returns; TD uses bootstrapping.\n- **Overlooking Baselines**: In policy gradients, baselines reduce variance but must be chosen carefully.\n- **Hierarchical RL**: Recursively optimal policies may take longer paths than flat optimal ones.",
