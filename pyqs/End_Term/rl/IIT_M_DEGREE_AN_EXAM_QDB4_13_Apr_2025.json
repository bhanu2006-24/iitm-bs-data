        "summary": "Here\u2019s a structured **summary of core topics, concepts, principles, and equations** for the **Reinforcement Learning (RL) exam**, followed by **Mermaid knowledge graphs** to visualize relationships.\n\n---\n\n## **1. Core Topics & Concepts**\n### **A. Fundamentals of RL**\n1. **RL vs. Supervised/Unsupervised Learning**\n   - RL is **not unsupervised** (despite lacking labels) because it optimizes a **reward signal** (not just data structure).\n   - **Key Difference**:\n     - Supervised: Learns from input-output pairs.\n     - Unsupervised: Learns data patterns (e.g., clustering).\n     - RL: Learns from **interactions** (trial-and-error) to maximize **cumulative reward**.\n\n2. **Markov Decision Process (MDP)**\n   - Defined by \\((S, A, P, R, \\gamma)\\):\n     - \\(S\\): State space.\n     - \\(A\\): Action space.\n     - \\(P(s'|s,a)\\): Transition probability.\n     - \\(R(s,a,s')\\): Reward function.\n     - \\(\\gamma\\): Discount factor (\\(0 \\leq \\gamma \\leq 1\\)).\n   - **Bellman Equation** (for value function \\(V^\\pi(s)\\)):\n     \\[\n     V^\\pi(s) = \\sum_a \\pi(a|s) \\sum_{s'} P(s'|s,a) [R(s,a,s') + \\gamma V^\\pi(s')]\n     \\]\n   - **Optimal Value Function**:\n     \\[\n     V^*(s) = \\max_a \\sum_{s'} P(s'|s,a) [R(s,a,s') + \\gamma V^*(s')]\n     \\]\n\n3. **Policies & Value Functions**\n   - **Policy (\\(\\pi\\))**: Maps states to actions (deterministic/stochastic).\n   - **State-Value Function (\\(V^\\pi(s)\\))**: Expected return from state \\(s\\) under policy \\(\\pi\\).\n   - **Action-Value Function (\\(Q^\\pi(s,a)\\))**: Expected return for taking action \\(a\\) in state \\(s\\) under \\(\\pi\\).\n\n---\n\n### **B. RL Algorithms**\n#### **1. Dynamic Programming (DP)**\n   - **Policy Evaluation**: Iteratively compute \\(V^\\pi\\) using Bellman updates.\n   - **Policy Improvement**: Greedily improve \\(\\pi\\) using \\(V^\\pi\\).\n   - **Value Iteration**: Directly compute \\(V^*\\) without policy iteration.\n     \\[\n     V_{k+1}(s) = \\max_a \\sum_{s'} P(s'|s,a) [R(s,a,s') + \\gamma V_k(s')]\n     \\]\n\n#### **2. Monte Carlo (MC) Methods**\n   - **First-Visit MC**: Average returns for the first time a state is visited in an episode.\n   - **Every-Visit MC**: Average returns for every visit to a state.\n   - **Key Property**: **Unbiased estimates** of \\(V^\\pi\\) or \\(Q^\\pi\\) (since they use full returns).\n   - **Limitation**: High variance; requires complete episodes.\n\n#### **3. Temporal Difference (TD) Learning**\n   - **TD(0) Update Rule**:\n     \\[\n     V(s) \\leftarrow V(s) + \\alpha [R + \\gamma V(s') - V(s)]\n     \\]\n   - **SARSA (On-Policy TD Control)**:\n     \\[\n     Q(s,a) \\leftarrow Q(s,a) + \\alpha [R + \\gamma Q(s',a') - Q(s,a)]\n     \\]\n   - **Q-Learning (Off-Policy TD Control)**:\n     \\[\n     Q(s,a) \\leftarrow Q(s,a) + \\alpha [R + \\gamma \\max_{a'} Q(s',a') - Q(s,a)]\n     \\]\n   - **Key Differences**:\n     - **MC**: Unbiased but high variance; updates at episode end.\n     - **TD**: Biased (bootstrapping) but lower variance; updates online.\n\n#### **4. Maximization Bias in Q-Learning**\n   - **Problem**: Overestimation of \\(Q(s,a)\\) due to \\(\\max\\) operator in noisy environments.\n   - **Effect**: Suboptimal policies and slower convergence.\n   - **Solutions**:\n     - Double Q-Learning (reduces bias by decoupling action selection and evaluation).\n     - Expected SARSA (uses expected value instead of \\(\\max\\)).\n\n#### **5. Exploration vs. Exploitation**\n   - **\\(\\epsilon\\)-Greedy**: Choose random action with probability \\(\\epsilon\\).\n   - **Upper Confidence Bound (UCB)**:\n     \\[\n     A_t = \\argmax_a \\left[ Q_t(a) + c \\sqrt{\\frac{\\ln t}{N_t(a)}} \\right]\n     \\]\n     - \\(N_t(a)\\): Number of times action \\(a\\) was chosen.\n     - \\(c\\): Exploration constant.\n   - **UCB Properties**:\n     - Confidence intervals shrink as \\(N_t(a)\\) increases.\n     - True value lies within the interval with high probability.\n\n#### **6. Expected SARSA**\n   - **Update Rule**:\n     \\[\n     Q(s,a) \\leftarrow Q(s,a) + \\alpha [R + \\gamma \\mathbb{E}_\\pi[Q(s',a')] - Q(s,a)]\n     \\]\n   - **Use Case**: High-stochasticity environments where \\(\\max\\) in Q-Learning is unstable.\n\n#### **7. Generalized Policy Iteration (GPI)**\n   - Combines **policy evaluation** and **policy improvement**.\n   - Examples:\n     - Value Iteration (special case of GPI).\n     - Q-Learning, SARSA, Monte Carlo Control.\n\n---\n\n### **C. Function Approximation & Deep RL**\n#### **1. Deep Q-Networks (DQN)**\n   - **Neural Network**: Approximates \\(Q(s,a; \\theta)\\).\n   - **Experience Replay**: Stores transitions \\((s,a,r,s')\\) to break temporal correlations.\n   - **Target Network**: Stabilizes training by using a separate network for TD targets.\n   - **Loss Function**:\n     \\[\n     L(\\theta) = \\mathbb{E}[(r + \\gamma \\max_{a'} Q(s',a'; \\theta^-) - Q(s,a; \\theta))^2]\n     \\]\n     - \\(\\theta^-\\): Target network parameters (updated periodically).\n\n#### **2. Policy Gradient Methods**\n   - **REINFORCE Algorithm**:\n     - **Gradient Theorem**:\n       \\[\n       \\nabla J(\\theta) \\propto \\mathbb{E}_\\pi \\left[ \\nabla \\log \\pi(a|s;\\theta) Q^\\pi(s,a) \\right]\n       \\]\n     - **Baseline (\\(b\\))**: Reduces variance; can be state-dependent (\\(b(s)\\)) or a constant.\n     - **Valid Baselines**: \\(b(s)\\) or random variable independent of \\(s,a\\).\n\n#### **3. Actor-Critic Methods**\n   - **Actor**: Policy \\(\\pi(a|s;\\theta)\\).\n   - **Critic**: Value function \\(V^\\pi(s; w)\\).\n   - **TD Target vs. Return (\\(G_t\\))**:\n     - Using TD target **reduces variance** but **introduces bias** in gradient estimates.\n\n---\n\n### **D. Advanced Topics**\n#### **1. Rollout Algorithms**\n   - **Idea**: Simulate trajectories from a state \\(s\\) using a model to estimate \\(Q(s,a)\\).\n   - **Use Case**: Improving a policy \\(\\pi\\) by comparing rollout returns.\n\n#### **2. Hierarchical RL**\n   - **Subgoals**: Decompose tasks into subtasks (e.g., `Start \u2192 Goto A \u2192 Goto B \u2192 End`).\n   - **Options**: Temporal abstraction (policies over policies).\n\n#### **3. Multi-Step Bootstrapping**\n   - **n-Step Returns**:\n     \\[\n     G_t^{(n)} = R_{t+1} + \\gamma R_{t+2} + \\dots + \\gamma^{n-1} R_{t+n} + \\gamma^n V(s_{t+n})\n     \\]\n   - **Eligibility Traces**: Combine TD and MC (e.g., TD(\\(\\lambda\\))).\n\n---\n\n## **2.

Exam-Specific Notes**\n1. **Monte Carlo vs. TD Learning** (Q4):\n   - MC is **unbiased** (uses full returns).\n   - TD is **biased** (bootstrapping) but **lower variance**.\n\n2. **Maximization Bias in Q-Learning** (Q5):\n   - Leads to **overestimation** of Q-values \u2192 **suboptimal policies**.\n\n3. **UCB Algorithm** (Q6):\n   - Confidence intervals **shrink** as actions are selected more often.\n   - True value lies within the interval **with high probability**.\n\n4. **Expected SARSA** (Q7):\n   - Best for **high-stochasticity** environments (avoids \\(\\max\\) overestimation).\n\n5. **Generalized Policy Iteration** (Q8):\n   - Includes **Value Iteration, Q-Learning, SARSA, MC Control**.\n\n6. **Actor-Critic** (Q9):\n   - Using **TD target** reduces variance but introduces bias.\n\n7. **Policy Gradient Baseline** (Q10):\n   - Baseline \\(b\\) can be **state-dependent** or **independent** of \\(s,a\\).\n\n8. **MDP Value Calculation** (Q11):\n   - Solve **linear system** from Bellman equations for equiprobable policy.\n\n9. **Deep Q-Network** (Q12-Q16):\n   - Compute **hidden layer activations** (ReLU) and **output Q-values**.\n   - **\u03b5-greedy** action selection: \\(P(a) = 1 - \\epsilon\\) for greedy action.\n\n10. **Rollout Algorithm** (Q17-Q18):\n    - Simulate trajectories to estimate **Q-values** for actions.\n\n11. **Hierarchical RL** (Q19-Q21):\n    - **Recursively Optimal Policy**: Follows hierarchy (e.g., `Start \u2192 A \u2192 B \u2192 End`).\n    - **Flat Optimal Policy**: May exploit shortcuts (e.g., teleport states).",
