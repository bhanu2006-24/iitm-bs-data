        "summary": "Here\u2019s a structured **summary of core topics, concepts, principles, and equations** for the **Deep Learning** exam, followed by **Mermaid knowledge graphs** to visualize relationships.\n\n---\n\n## **1. Core Topics & Key Concepts**\n### **A. Neural Network Basics**\n1. **Activation Functions**\n   - **Output Layer Choices for Regression**:\n     - Target in `(-1, 1)` \u2192 Use **Tanh** (squashes to `[-1, 1]`).\n     - Unbounded target \u2192 Use **Linear (Identity)**.\n     - **ReLU** is **not suitable** for bounded regression (outputs \u2265 0).\n     - *Equation*:\n       - Tanh: \\( \\tanh(x) = \\frac{e^x - e^{-x}}{e^x + e^{-x}} \\)\n       - ReLU: \\( \\text{ReLU}(x) = \\max(0, x) \\)\n\n2. **Bias-Variance Tradeoff**\n   - **Training Error (Curve 2)**: Decreases with complexity (underfitting \u2192 overfitting).\n   - **Test Error (Curve 1)**: U-shaped (high bias \u2192 high variance).\n   - **Optimal Complexity (Line 3)**: Minimizes test error (low bias, low variance).\n   - *Key Insight*: High bias = underfitting; high variance = overfitting.\n\n3. **Dropout**\n   - **Training**: Randomly drop neurons with probability `p` (e.g., `p=0.5`).\n   - **Inference**: Scale activations by `p` (or `1-p` if using inverted dropout).\n   - *Purpose*: Prevents co-adaptation, acts as ensemble method.\n\n---\n\n### **B. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**\n1. **Convolution Layer Math**\n   - **Output Size Calculation**:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Output Size} = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{W - F + 2P}{S} \\right\\rfloor + 1\n     \\]\n     - `W`: Input size, `F`: Filter size, `P`: Padding, `S`: Stride.\n   - **Example (Q7)**:\n     - Input: `100\u00d7100\u00d75`, Kernel: `9\u00d79`, Stride: `1`, Output: `100\u00d7100\u00d710`.\n     - *Solution*: \\( P = 4 \\) (since \\( 100 - 9 + 2P = 99 \\Rightarrow P = 4 \\)).\n\n2. **Pooling Layers**\n   - **Max Pooling**: Reduces spatial dimensions (e.g., `F=2, S=2` halves size).\n   - **Volume Propagation**:\n     - Input: `64\u00d764\u00d73` \u2192 Conv1 (`F=3, S=1, P=1, K=6`) \u2192 `64\u00d764\u00d76` \u2192 MaxPool (`F=2, S=2`) \u2192 `32\u00d732\u00d76`.\n\n3. **Parameter Counting**\n   - **Convolutional Layer**:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Params} = (F \\times F \\times D_{\\text{in}} + 1) \\times K\n     \\]\n     - `D_in`: Input depth, `K`: Number of filters.\n   - **Fully Connected (FC) Layer**:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Params} = (D_{\\text{in}} + 1) \\times D_{\\text{out}}\n     \\]\n   - **Example (Q24)**:\n     - Conv2: `F=3, K=12, D_in=6` \u2192 Params = `(3\u00d73\u00d76 + 1) \u00d7 12 = 648`.\n\n---\n\n### **C. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**\n1. **Vanilla RNN Equations**\n   - **State Update**:\n     \\[\n     s_t = \\sigma(U x_t + W s_{t-1} + b)\n     \\]\n   - **Output**:\n     \\[\n     \\hat{y}_t = \\text{softmax}(V s_t + c)\n     \\]\n   - **Parameter Count**:\n     - `U`: `D_x \u00d7 D_h` (input-to-hidden), `W`: `D_h \u00d7 D_h` (hidden-to-hidden).\n     - `V`: `D_h \u00d7 D_y` (hidden-to-output).\n     - *Example (Q27)*: `D_x=6, D_h=2, D_y=5` \u2192 Total params = `(6\u00d72 + 2\u00d72 + 2) + (2\u00d75 + 5) = 33`.\n\n2. **Initialization & Behavior**\n   - **Zero Initialization**: All outputs = uniform (e.g., `[0.2, 0.2, ..., 0.2]` for softmax).\n   - **Vanishing Gradients**: If weights are too small, gradients explode/vanish.\n\n---\n\n### **D. Transformers & Attention**\n1. **Self-Attention Mechanics**\n   - **Query/Key/Value (Q/K/V)**:\n     - `Q = W_Q X`, `K = W_K X`, `V = W_V X` (X: input embeddings).\n     - *Dimensions*:\n       - `W_Q`: `D_model \u00d7 D_head` (e.g., `32\u00d74` for `D_model=32, D_head=4`).\n       - Attention scores: `Q K^T` \u2192 `Seq_len \u00d7 Seq_len` (e.g., `5\u00d75` for seq_len=5).\n   - **Multi-Head Attention**:\n     - Concatenate heads \u2192 Project back to `D_model`.\n     - *Example (Q12)*: Output dim = `5 \u00d7 32` (seq_len \u00d7 D_model).\n\n2. **Masked Self-Attention (Decoder)**\n   - **Mask Matrix `M`**:\n     - Upper triangular (future tokens masked).\n     - `M_ij = 0` if `i \u2264 j`, else `-\u221e` (before softmax).\n     - *Example (Q16)*: `M_41 = -\u221e` (token 4 cannot attend to token 1).\n\n3. **Cross-Attention**\n   - **Decoder Cross-Attention**:\n     - Query: Decoder output.\n     - Key/Value: Encoder output.\n     - *Equation*: `Attention(Q_dec, K_enc, V_enc)`.\n\n---\n\n### **E. Optimization & Gradient Descent**\n1. **Learning Rate Impact**\n   - **Too High (`\u03b7`)** \u2192 Overshooting/divergence.\n   - **Too Low (`\u03b7`)** \u2192 Slow convergence.\n   - *Example (Q30)*:\n     - `\u03b73 < \u03b72 < \u03b71` (based on contour plots).\n\n2. **Gradient Descent Update**\n   - **Update Rule**:\n     \\[\n     \\theta_{t+1} = \\theta_t - \\eta \\nabla f(\\theta_t)\n     \\]\n   - *Example (Q32)*:\n     - For `f(x,y) = 0.1x\u00b2 + y\u00b2`, `\u03b7=0.5`:\n       \\[\n       x_{t+1} = x_t - 0.5 \\times 0.2x_t = 0.9x_t\n       \\]\n\n---\n\n### **F. Word Embeddings (CBOW)**\n1. **CBOW Architecture**\n   - **Context \u2192 Target Prediction**:\n     - Input: Context word embeddings (averaged).\n     - Output: Softmax over vocabulary.\n   - **Probability Calculation**:\n     \\[\n     P(w_t | w_{t-1}) = \\frac{e^{v_{w_t}^T h}}{\\sum_i e^{v_i^T h}}\n     \\]\n     - `h`: Context embedding (average of `W_context` rows).\n     - *Example (Q22)*:\n       - Context=\"two\" \u2192 `h = W_context[:,1]`.\n       - Target=\"three\" \u2192 `P = softmax(W_word[:,2]^T h)`.\n\n2. **Gradient Descent Update**\n   - **Update Rule**:\n     \\[\n     W_{\\text{word}}[:, \\text{target}] += \\eta (h - \\hat{y})\n     \\]\n     - *Example (Q23)*: After update, `W_word[:,2]` changes \u2192 `b - a \u2248 0.25`.\n\n---\n\n### **G. Encoder-Decoder Tasks**\n1. **When RNNs Are Unnecessary**\n   - **Non-Sequential Outputs**:\n     - Classification (single label), sentiment analysis.\n   - **Sequential Outputs**:\n     - Translation, summarization, captioning (require RNNs/Transformers).\n\n---\n\n## **2.
