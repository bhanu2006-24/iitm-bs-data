Exam Tips**\n1. **Activation Functions:**\n   - For regression in (\u22121, 1), use **Tanh** or **Linear** (not ReLU).\n2. **Dropout:**\n   - Remember to scale by `p` during **inference**.\n3. **CNN Calculations:**\n   - Master the **output size formula** and **parameter count**.\n4. **Transformers:**\n   - **Cross-attention** in decoder uses **decoder queries** and **encoder keys/values**.\n   - **Masking** is applied **before softmax**.\n5. **RNNs:**\n   - If all weights are zero, outputs are uniform (for softmax).\n6. **Optimization:**\n   - Higher \\( \\eta \\) \u2192 faster but unstable.\n   - Lower \\( \\eta \\) \u2192 slower but stable.\n7. **Sigmoid Optimization:**\n   - Max output occurs when input aligns with weights.\n\n---\n**Good luck!** Let me know if you'd like further clarifications on any topic.",
