Core Topics & Concepts**\n### **A. Perceptron & Linear Classification**\n- **Key Idea**: Linear decision boundary for binary classification.\n- **Limitation**: Struggles with **overlapping classes** (non-linearly separable data).\n- **Equation**:\n  - Perceptron update rule:\n    \\( w \\leftarrow w + \\eta (y - \\hat{y}) x \\)\n  - Decision boundary: \\( w^T x + b = 0 \\).\n\n### **B. Feedforward Neural Networks (FNN) & Backpropagation**\n- **Architecture**:\n  - Input layer \u2192 Hidden layer(s) \u2192 Output layer.\n  - Example: 15 (input) \u2192 25 (hidden, sigmoid) \u2192 1 (output, sigmoid).\n- **Backpropagation**:\n  - Chain rule for gradient computation.\n  - **Sigmoid derivative**:\n    \\( \\sigma'(z) = \\sigma(z)(1 - \\sigma(z)) \\).\n  - **Gradient for weight \\( w_j \\)** (hidden \u2192 output):\n    \\( \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial w_j} = -(y - \\hat{y}) \\cdot \\sigma'\\left(\\sum_i w_i h_i\\right) \\cdot h_j \\).\n- **Loss Functions**:\n  - Binary cross-entropy:\n    \\( L = -[y \\log(\\hat{y}) + (1-y) \\log(1-\\hat{y})] \\).\n\n### **C. Optimization Algorithms**\n1. **Mini-Batch Gradient Descent (MB-GD)**:\n   - Trade-off: Larger batch \u2192 fewer updates per epoch but more stable gradients.\n   - **Key Insight**: Total parameter updates remain **constant** if epochs double with batch size (Question 4).\n2. **Momentum-Based GD**:\n   - Accelerates convergence by adding a \"momentum\" term (smoothing updates).\n   - **Sparse data behavior**: Updates **weight vectors infrequently** (Question 5).\n3. **AdaGrad**:\n   - Adapts learning rates per parameter (frequent updates for sparse features).\n   - **Sparse data behavior**: **Bias vector updates frequently** (Question 5).\n\n### **D. Activation Functions**\n| Function       | Equation                     | Pros                          | Cons                          |\n|----------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| **Sigmoid**    | \\( \\sigma(z) = \\frac{1}{1+e^{-z}} \\) | Smooth gradients              | Vanishing gradients           |\n| **ReLU**       | \\( \\text{ReLU}(z) = \\max(0, z) \\) | Mitigates vanishing gradients | Dying ReLU problem             |\n| **Tanh**       | \\( \\tanh(z) = \\frac{e^z - e^{-z}}{e^z + e^{-z}} \\) | Zero-centered outputs         | Vanishing gradients            |\n\n- **Key Insight**: ReLU > Sigmoid for vanishing gradients (Question 6).\n\n### **E. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**\n- **Vanishing/Exploding Gradients**:\n  - **Causes**: Repeated multiplication of weights in backpropagation through time (BPTT).\n  - **Mitigation**:\n    - **LSTM/GRU**: Gating mechanisms (forget, input, output gates).\n    - **Gradient Clipping**: Caps gradients to avoid explosion.\n    - **ReLU**: Not ideal for RNNs (can cause exploding gradients).\n- **LSTM vs. GRU**:\n  | Feature       | LSTM                          | GRU                           |\n  |---------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n  | **Gates**     | 3 (input, forget, output)      | 2 (update, reset)             |\n  | **Parameters**| 4 weight matrices              | 3 weight matrices             |\n  | **Training**  | Slower convergence            | Faster convergence            |\n  - **Total parameters**: LSTM (8), GRU (6) (Question 7).\n  - **Gradient Handling**: Both mitigate vanishing gradients; GRU is simpler (Question 8).\n\n### **F.

Bias-Variance Tradeoff**\n- **Squared Bias**:\n  \\( \\text{Bias}^2 = (\\text{avg prediction} - \\text{true value})^2 \\).\n- Example (Question 10):\n  - Model A: \\( \\text{Bias}^2 = 0.01 \\)\n  - Model B: \\( \\text{Bias}^2 = 0.02 \\)\n  - Model C: \\( \\text{Bias}^2 = 0.25 \\).\n\n### **J.
