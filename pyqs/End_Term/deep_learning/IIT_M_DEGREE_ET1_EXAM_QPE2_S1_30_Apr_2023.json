Assume that we have 33 different machines to train the model. One out of 33 machines acts as a master machine. The actual weight update happens in the master machine. The master machine can send one sample for the rest of the machines along with a copy of the model in its current state to compute the gradients. We call this entire set-up parallelization. Which of the following deep learning architectures can be trained in parallel then?"

Core Topics & Concepts**\n### **A. Foundations of Neural Networks**\n1. **McCulloch-Pitts (MP) Neuron**\n   - Binary threshold activation: \\( \\hat{y} = \\begin{cases} 1 & \\text{if } \\sum x_i \\geq \\theta \\\\ 0 & \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases} \\)\n   - **Boolean Functions**: AND, OR, NAND, NOR (Q2).\n   - **Number of Correctly Classified (NCC)** vs. threshold \\( \\theta \\).\n\n2. **Gradient Descent (GD) & Backpropagation**\n   - **Loss Function**: Mean Squared Error (MSE):\n     \\( L = \\frac{1}{2}(y - \\hat{y})^2 \\)\n   - **Sigmoid Neuron Update** (Q4):\n     - Forward pass: \\( \\hat{y} = \\sigma(wx + b) \\)\n     - Backward pass: Compute gradients \\( \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial w}, \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial b} \\)\n     - Update: \\( w \\leftarrow w - \\eta \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial w} \\), \\( b \\leftarrow b - \\eta \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial b} \\)\n   - **Vanishing Gradients**: ReLU avoids this (unlike sigmoid).\n\n3. **Parameter Counting in Networks**\n   - **Fully Connected (FC) Layers** (Q7):\n     - Input: \\( n \\), Hidden: \\( h \\), Output: \\( m \\)\n     - Parameters: \\( (n \\times h) + h + (h \\times m) + m \\)\n   - **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** (Q5):\n     - Kernel size \\( k \\times k \\), #filters \\( f \\), input channels \\( c \\)\n     - Parameters per layer: \\( f \\times (k \\times k \\times c + 1) \\) (including bias).\n   - **Skip-gram Model** (Q6):\n     - Vocabulary size \\( |V| \\), embedding dim \\( h \\)\n     - Parameters: \\( |V| \\times h \\) (input embeddings) + \\( |V| \\times h \\) (output weights) = \\( 2|V|h \\).\n\n4. **Activation Functions**\n   - **ReLU**: \\( \\text{ReLU}(x) = \\max(0, x) \\)\n   - **Sigmoid**: \\( \\sigma(x) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}} \\)\n   - **Softmax**: \\( \\text{softmax}(x_i) = \\frac{e^{x_i}}{\\sum_j e^{x_j}} \\)\n\n5. **Loss Functions**\n   - **Cross-Entropy Loss** (Q8, Q15):\n     \\( L = -\\sum y_i \\log(\\hat{y}_i) \\)\n   - **MSE**: \\( L = \\frac{1}{2}(y - \\hat{y})^2 \\)\n\n6. **Initialization & Vanishing Gradients**\n   - If weights/bias initialized to **zero**, gradients vanish (Q8, Q9).\n   - **ReLU** helps mitigate vanishing gradients (unlike sigmoid).\n\n---\n\n### **B.

Word Embeddings & NLP**\n1. **CBOW (Continuous Bag of Words)** (Q3):\n   - Predicts **target word** from **context words**.\n   - **Context-independent embeddings**: Same word (\"bank\") has same vector regardless of context.\n\n2. **Co-occurrence Matrices** (Q14):\n   - Size: \\( |V| \\times |V| \\) (vocabulary vs. context).\n   - Valid sizes: \\( 14 \\times 14 \\), \\( 14 \\times 13 \\), etc.\n\n3. **Vocabulary Construction** (Q13):\n   - Unique words in corpus \u2192 \\( |V| = 14 \\).\n\n---\n\n### **D. Optimization & Regularization**\n1. **L2 Regularization** (Q11):\n   - Adds \\( \\lambda \\sum w_i^2 \\) to loss.\n   - **Effects**:\n     - May **increase training error** (weights constrained).\n     - Can **decrease test error** (reduces overfitting).\n     - Drives **less important weights to near-zero**.\n\n2. **Mini-batch Gradient Descent** (Q12):\n   - Parallelizable across **all architectures** (FC, CNN, RNN, Transformers).\n\n3. **Contour Plots & Optimization** (Q10):\n   - **Flat minima/maxima**: Regions where loss changes slowly.\n   - Parallel lines \u2192 **no local minima/maxima** (only flat regions).\n\n---\n\n### **E. Parallelization & Distributed Training**\n- **Data Parallelism** (Q12):\n  - Master node aggregates gradients from workers.\n  - Applicable to **all deep learning models**.\n\n---\n\n## **2.
