        "summary": "Here\u2019s a structured **summary of core topics, concepts, principles, and equations** essential for the **Deep Learning** exam, followed by **Mermaid knowledge graphs** to visualize relationships.\n\n---\n\n## **1. Core Topics & Key Concepts**\n### **A. Perceptron & Linear Classification**\n- **Perceptron Limitations**:\n  - Struggles with **overlapping classes** (non-linearly separable data).\n  - Decision boundary is linear; fails when classes share feature values.\n- **Equation**:\n  - Perceptron update rule:\n    \\( w \\leftarrow w + \\eta \\cdot (y - \\hat{y}) \\cdot x \\)\n    where \\( \\eta \\) = learning rate, \\( y \\) = true label, \\( \\hat{y} \\) = prediction.\n\n---\n\n### **B. Feedforward Neural Networks (FNN) & Backpropagation**\n- **Architecture**:\n  - Input layer \u2192 Hidden layer(s) \u2192 Output layer.\n  - Example: 15 (input) \u2192 25 (hidden, sigmoid) \u2192 1 (output, sigmoid).\n- **Backpropagation**:\n  - Chain rule for gradient computation.\n  - **Sigmoid derivative**:\n    \\( \\sigma'(z) = \\sigma(z) \\cdot (1 - \\sigma(z)) \\).\n- **Binary Cross-Entropy Loss**:\n  \\( L = -[y \\log(\\hat{y}) + (1-y) \\log(1-\\hat{y})] \\).\n- **Gradient for Output Layer Weights** (Question 3):\n  \\( \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial w_j} = - (y - \\hat{y}) \\cdot \\sigma'\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{25} w_i h_i\\right) \\cdot h_j \\).\n\n---\n\n### **C. Optimization Algorithms**\n1. **Mini-Batch Gradient Descent (MB-GD)**:\n   - **Trade-off**: Larger batch size \u2192 fewer updates per epoch but more stable gradients.\n   - **Total updates** = (Epochs \u00d7 Data points) / Batch size.\n   - **Key Insight**: Doubling batch size **doubles epochs** but **keeps total updates constant** (Question 4).\n\n2. **Momentum-Based GD vs. AdaGrad**:\n   - **Momentum**: Accelerates GD in relevant directions; **sparse features update rarely** (Question 5).\n   - **AdaGrad**: Adapts learning rates per parameter; **frequent updates for sparse features**.\n\n3. **Vanishing/Exploding Gradients**:\n   - **ReLU** mitigates vanishing gradients better than **sigmoid** (Question 6).\n   - **Gradient Clipping**: Caps gradients to avoid exploding gradients.\n\n---\n\n### **D. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**\n- **Vanishing/Exploding Gradients**:\n  - Caused by repeated multiplication of weights in recurrent connections.\n  - **Mitigation**:\n    - **LSTM/GRU**: Gating mechanisms (forget, input, output gates).\n    - **Gradient Clipping**: Limits gradient magnitudes.\n- **LSTM vs. GRU**:\n  - **LSTM**: 4 weight matrices (input, forget, output, cell state).\n  - **GRU**: 3 weight matrices (update, reset, candidate).\n  - **GRU** converges faster due to simpler architecture (Questions 7\u20138).\n\n---\n\n### **E. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**\n- **Parameter Calculation** (Question 11):\n  - **Conv Layer**: \\( (F_h \\times F_w \\times C_{in} + 1) \\times C_{out} \\).\n  - **Fully Connected (FC) Layer**: \\( (I + 1) \\times O \\).\n  - **Example**:\n    - Conv1: \\( (3 \\times 3 \\times 3 + 1) \\times 32 = 896 \\).\n    - Conv2: \\( (4 \\times 4 \\times 32 + 1) \\times 64 = 32,896 \\).\n    - FC: \\( (1024 + 1) \\times 128 = 131,136 \\).\n    - Output: \\( (128 + 1) \\times 10 = 1,290 \\).\n    - **Total**: 896 + 32,896 + 131,136 + 1,290 = **166,218** (Note: Question 11\u2019s answer is 28,256, likely due to different assumptions like no bias or smaller input dimensions).\n\n---\n\n### **F. Word Embeddings (Word2Vec)**\n1. **CBOW (Continuous Bag of Words)**:\n   - Predicts target word from context.\n   - **Parameters**: \\( |V| \\times d \\) (vocab size \u00d7 embedding dim).\n   - **Example** (Question 12): \\( 10,000 \\times 300 = 3,000,000 \\).\n\n2. **Skip-Gram**:\n   - Predicts context from target word.\n   - **Negative Sampling**:\n     - For each positive sample, generate \\( k \\) negative samples.\n     - **Total samples** = \\( \\text{unique words} \\times (2 \\times \\text{window size}) \\times (1 + k) \\).\n     - **Example** (Question 15):\n       - 8 words, window=3, \\( k=10 \\).\n       - \\( 8 \\times 6 \\times 11 = 528 \\) (Question\u2019s answer is 396, likely due to edge cases).\n\n3. **Cross-Entropy Loss** (Question 13):\n   \\( L = -\\log(p_{\\text{target}}) \\).\n   - For \\( p = 0.02 \\), \\( L = -\\log(0.02) \\approx 3.912 \\).\n\n---\n\n### **G. Ensemble Learning**\n- **Majority Voting**:\n  - For 3 models with 50% error rate, **ensemble error rate** = \\( 0.5^3 \\times 3 = 0.375 \\) (Question 9).\n  - **Answer**: 0.375 (between 0.45 and 0.55 is incorrect; likely a misprint).\n\n---\n\n### **H. Bias-Variance Tradeoff**\n- **Squared Bias** (Question 10):\n  - \\( \\text{Bias}^2 = (\\text{Avg Prediction} - \\text{True Value})^2 \\).\n  - **Example**:\n    - Model A: \\( \\text{Avg} = [1.1, 1.9, 3.1, 3.9] \\), True = [1,2,3,4].\n    - \\( \\text{Bias}^2 = \\frac{(0.1^2 + (-0.1)^2 + 0.1^2 + (-0.1)^2)}{4} = 0.01 \\).\n\n---\n\n### **I. RNN Parameter Counting**\n- **RNN Equations** (Questions 16\u201318):\n  - \\( s_t = \\sigma(U x_t + W s_{t-1} + b) \\).\n  - \\( \\hat{y}_t = \\text{softmax}(V s_t + c) \\).\n- **Parameters**:\n  - \\( U \\): \\( d_x \\times d_h \\) (input \u2192 hidden).\n  - \\( W \\): \\( d_h \\times d_h \\) (hidden \u2192 hidden).\n  - \\( V \\): \\( d_h \\times d_y \\) (hidden \u2192 output).\n  - **Total**: \\( (d_x \\times d_h) + (d_h \\times d_h) + (d_h \\times d_y) + b + c \\).\n  - **Example** (Question 16):\n    - \\( d_x = 5 \\), \\( d_h = 2 \\), \\( d_y = 5 \\).\n    - \\( U \\): \\( 5 \\times 2 = 10 \\).\n    - \\( W \\): \\( 2 \\times 2 = 4 \\).\n    - \\( V \\): \\( 2 \\times 5 = 10 \\).\n    - Biases: \\( b = 2 \\), \\( c = 5 \\).\n    - **Total**: \\( 10 + 4 + 10 + 2 + 5 = 31 \\).\n\n---\n\n## **2.
