Core Topics & Concepts**\n### **A. Neural Network Basics**\n1. **Activation Functions**\n   - **ReLU**: \\( f(x) = \\max(0, x) \\). Not ideal for output layers in regression with targets in \\((-1, 1)\\) (Q2).\n   - **Tanh**: \\( f(x) = \\tanh(x) \\). Outputs in \\((-1, 1)\\); good for bounded regression.\n   - **Linear (Identity)**: \\( f(x) = x \\). Unbounded; suitable for regression.\n   - **Sigmoid**: \\( f(x) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}} \\). Outputs in \\((0, 1)\\); used for binary classification.\n\n2. **Bias-Variance Tradeoff** (Q5)\n   - **Underfitting (High Bias)**: High training/test error; model too simple.\n   - **Overfitting (High Variance)**: Low training error, high test error; model too complex.\n   - **Optimal Model**: Minimizes test error (point (3) in Q5 corresponds to low bias, high variance).\n\n3. **Dropout** (Q4)\n   - **Training**: Randomly drop neurons with probability \\( p \\) (e.g., \\( p = 0.5 \\)).\n   - **Inference**: Scale activations by \\( p \\) (no dropout).\n   - **Purpose**: Prevents co-adaptation; reduces overfitting.\n\n---\n\n### **B.
