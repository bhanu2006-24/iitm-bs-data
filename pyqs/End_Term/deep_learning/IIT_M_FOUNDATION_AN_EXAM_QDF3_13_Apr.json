Core Topics & Concepts**\n### **A. Neural Networks & Activation Functions**\n1. **Activation Functions**:\n   - **ReLU**: \\( f(x) = \\max(0, x) \\). Not ideal for output layers in regression with targets in \\((-1, 1)\\) (Q2).\n   - **Tanh**: \\( f(x) = \\tanh(x) \\). Outputs in \\((-1, 1)\\); suitable for regression in this range.\n   - **Linear (Identity)**: \\( f(x) = x \\). Suitable for unbounded regression.\n   - **Sigmoid**: \\( \\sigma(x) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}} \\). Used in binary classification/output gates.\n\n2. **Output Layer Choices**:\n   - Regression (target in \\((-1, 1)\\)): **Tanh** or **Linear**.\n   - Binary classification: **Sigmoid**.\n   - Multi-class classification: **Softmax**.\n\n3. **Bias-Variance Tradeoff** (Q5):\n   - **Training Error (Curve 2)**: Decreases with complexity; may overfit.\n   - **Test Error (Curve 1)**: U-shaped; minimal at optimal complexity (vertical line).\n   - **High Bias/Low Variance**: Underfitting (left of optimal point).\n   - **Low Bias/High Variance**: Overfitting (right of optimal point).\n\n---\n\n### **B.
