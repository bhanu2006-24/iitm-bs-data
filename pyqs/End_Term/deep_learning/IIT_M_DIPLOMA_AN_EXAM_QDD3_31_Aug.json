        "summary": "Here\u2019s a structured **summary of core topics, concepts, principles, and equations** for the **Deep Learning** exam, followed by **Mermaid knowledge graphs** to visualize relationships.\n\n---\n\n## **Core Topics & Key Concepts**\n### **1. Model Performance & Generalization**\n- **Key Concepts**:\n  - **Training Loss vs. Generalization Error**: A model with zero training loss may still overfit (high variance) and perform poorly on unseen data.\n  - **Regularization**: Adds a penalty term (e.g., L1/L2) to the loss function to reduce overfitting.\n    - **Effect**: Higher training loss but lower generalization error.\n  - **Bias-Variance Tradeoff**: Underfitting (high bias) vs. overfitting (high variance).\n\n- **Equations**:\n  - **MSE Loss**: \\( L = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2 \\)\n  - **L2 Regularization**: \\( L_{\\text{reg}} = L + \\lambda \\sum_j w_j^2 \\)\n\n---\n\n### **2. Vanishing Gradients & Pretraining**\n- **Key Concepts**:\n  - **Vanishing Gradients**: Gradients become exponentially small in deep networks (common with sigmoid/tanh).\n  - **Unsupervised Layerwise Pretraining**:\n    - Trains one layer at a time (e.g., autoencoders) to initialize weights.\n    - Helps mitigate vanishing gradients by providing better initial weights for supervised fine-tuning.\n  - **Skip Connections (ResNet)**: Add identity shortcuts to bypass layers, enabling gradient flow.\n\n- **Solutions**:\n  - ReLU activation (avoids saturation).\n  - Batch normalization.\n  - Residual connections.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Linear Regression & SGD**\n- **Key Concepts**:\n  - **Linear Regression**: \\(\\hat{y} = w^T x + b\\) (bias term often absorbed into \\(w_0\\)).\n  - **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)**:\n    - Updates weights per sample (not full batch).\n    - Weight update: \\( w_j \\leftarrow w_j - \\eta \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial w_j} \\).\n  - **Feature Updates**: Weights are updated only for non-zero features in a sample.\n\n- **Equations**:\n  - **Prediction**: \\(\\hat{y} = \\sum_{j=0}^d w_j x_j\\)\n  - **MSE Gradient**: \\(\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial w_j} = -2 (y - \\hat{y}) x_j\\)\n  - **SGD Update**: \\( w_j \\leftarrow w_j + 2 \\eta (y - \\hat{y}) x_j \\)\n\n---\n\n### **4.

Kernel**:\n    \\( \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial K_{ij}} = \\sum_{m,n} \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial A_{mn}} \\frac{\\partial A_{mn}}{\\partial K_{ij}} \\)\n    (where \\(A\\) = activation map).\n\n---\n\n### **5. Attention Mechanisms**\n- **Key Concepts**:\n  - **Attention Score**: Measures relevance between decoder hidden state (\\(s_{t-1}\\)) and encoder hidden states (\\(h_j\\)).\n  - **Softmax Normalization**: Converts scores to probabilities (\\(\\alpha_{tj}\\)).\n  - **Context Vector**: Weighted sum of encoder hidden states.\n  - **Multi-Head Attention**: Splits embeddings into multiple heads for parallel attention.\n\n- **Equations**:\n  - **Score Function**:\n    \\( \\text{score}(s_{t-1}, h_j) = V_{\\text{att}}^\\top \\tanh(U_{\\text{att}} s_{t-1} + W_{\\text{att}} h_j) \\)\n  - **Attention Weights**:\n    \\( \\alpha_{tj} = \\frac{\\exp(\\text{score}(s_{t-1}, h_j))}{\\sum_i \\exp(\\text{score}(s_{t-1}, h_i))} \\)\n  - **Context Vector**:\n    \\( c_t = \\sum_j \\alpha_{tj} h_j \\)\n  - **Scaled Dot-Product Attention**:\n    \\( \\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \\text{softmax}\\left(\\frac{QK^\\top}{\\sqrt{d_k}}\\right) V \\)\n\n---\n\n### **6. Transformer Architecture**\n- **Key Concepts**:\n  - **Self-Attention**: Computes relationships between all tokens in a sequence.\n  - **Multi-Head Attention**: Concatenates outputs from multiple attention heads.\n  - **Feed-Forward Network (FFN)**: Two linear layers with ReLU activation.\n  - **Positional Encoding**: Adds sequence order information to embeddings.\n\n- **Equations**:\n  - **Query/Key/Value Projections**:\n    \\( Q = W_Q X \\), \\( K = W_K X \\), \\( V = W_V X \\)\n  - **FFN Parameters**:\n    \\( W_1 \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_{\\text{model}} \\times d_{\\text{ff}}} \\),\n    \\( W_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_{\\text{ff}} \\times d_{\\text{model}}} \\)\n  - **Total FFN Parameters**:\n    \\( d_{\\text{model}} \\times d_{\\text{ff}} + d_{\\text{ff}} \\times d_{\\text{model}} + d_{\\text{ff}} + d_{\\text{model}} \\)\n    (including biases).\n\n---\n\n### **7.
