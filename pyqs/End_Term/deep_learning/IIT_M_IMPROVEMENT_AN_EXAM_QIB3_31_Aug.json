Core Topics & Concepts**\n### **A. Fundamentals of Deep Learning**\n1. **Model Performance & Generalization**\n   - **Training Loss vs. Generalization Error**:\n     - Zero training loss \u2260 good generalization (overfitting risk).\n     - Regularization (L1/L2) increases training loss but reduces generalization error.\n   - **Bias-Variance Tradeoff**:\n     - High bias \u2192 Underfitting.\n     - High variance \u2192 Overfitting.\n   - **Regularization**:\n     - Adds penalty term to loss function (e.g., \\( L = \\text{MSE} + \\lambda \\|\\theta\\|^2 \\)).\n\n2. **Vanishing Gradient Problem**\n   - **Causes**: Deep networks with sigmoid/tanh activations lead to exponentially small gradients.\n   - **Solutions**:\n     - **Unsupervised Pretraining**: Layer-wise training (e.g., autoencoders) initializes weights better.\n     - **Skip Connections**: Residual networks (ResNet) add identity mappings (\\( F(x) + x \\)).\n     - **ReLU/Leaky ReLU**: Avoids saturation (gradient = 1 for \\( x > 0 \\)).\n\n---\n\n### **B. Linear Regression & Gradient Descent**\n1. **Linear Regression Model**:\n   - Prediction: \\( \\hat{y} = w^T x \\) (where \\( x \\) includes bias term).\n   - **Mean Squared Error (MSE) Loss**:\n     \\[\n     L = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2\n     \\]\n2. **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)**:\n   - Update rule:\n     \\[\n     w_{j+1} = w_j - \\eta \\nabla_w L\n     \\]\n   - **Key Insight**: Weights updated only for non-zero features in a sample.\n\n---\n\n### **C.
