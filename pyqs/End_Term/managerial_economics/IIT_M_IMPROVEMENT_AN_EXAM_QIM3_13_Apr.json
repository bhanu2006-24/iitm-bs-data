The orchard owner pays nothing for this service, however, because the bees come to the orchard without him having to do anything. Because there are not enough bees to pollinate the entire orchard, the orchard owner must complete the pollination by artificial means, at a cost of $10 per acre of trees. \nBeekeeping has a marginal cost MC = 10 + 5Q, where Q is the number of beehives. Each hive yields $40 worth of honey. \nBased on the above data, answer the given subquestions."

The second dealership, Latif\u2019s Motors, always sells lower-quality cars. On average, it costs Latif\u2019s only $4000 for each car that it sells. If consumers knew the quality of the used cars they were buying, they would pay $9,000 on average for Hamid\u2019s cars and only $6000 on average for Latif\u2019s cars. Without more information, consumers do not know the quality of each dealership\u2019s cars. In this case, they would figure that they have a 50-50 chance of ending up with a high quality car, and are thus willing to pay $7500 for a car. Hamid has an idea: He will offer a bumper-to-bumper warranty for all cars he sells. He knows that a warranty lasting <b>Y</b> years will cost <b>$500Y</b> on average, and he also knows that if Latif tries to offer the same warranty, it will cost Latif <b>$1000Y</b> on average.

The first, Hamid\u2019s Cars, always sells high-quality cars that it carefully inspects and, if necessary, services. On average, it costs Hamid\u2019s $7000 to buy and service each car that it sells. The second dealership, Latif\u2019s Motors, always sells lower-quality cars. On average, it costs Latif\u2019s only $4000 for each car that it sells. If consumers knew the quality of the used cars they were buying, they would pay $9,000 on average for Hamid\u2019s cars and only $6000 on average for Latif\u2019s cars. Without more information, consumers do not know the quality of each dealership\u2019s cars. In this case, they would figure that they have a 50-50 chance of ending up with a high quality car, and are thus willing to pay $7500 for a car. Hamid has an idea: He will offer a bumper-to-bumper warranty for all cars he sells. He knows that a warranty lasting <b>Y</b> years will cost <b>$500Y</b> on average, and he also knows that if Latif tries to offer the same warranty, it will cost Latif <b>$1000Y</b> on average.

        "summary": "Here\u2019s a structured **summary of core topics, concepts, principles, and equations** for the **Managerial Economics (Computer-Based Exam)**, along with **Mermaid knowledge graphs** to visualize relationships.\n\n---\n\n## **Core Topics & Key Concepts**\n### **1. Asymmetric Information & Market Failures**\n#### **Key Concepts:**\n- **Adverse Selection**: High-risk individuals are more likely to purchase insurance (e.g., Q2, Q3, Q40).\n  - Example: High-risk people buy insurance at a price that causes losses for the insurer.\n- **Moral Hazard**: Individuals take more risks after obtaining insurance (e.g., Q41).\n  - Example: A person with health insurance may visit the doctor more often.\n- **Signaling & Screening**:\n  - **Signaling**: High-quality sellers use warranties to distinguish themselves (e.g., Q19\u2013Q25).\n  - **Screening**: Buyers use mechanisms (e.g., warranties) to identify quality.\n- **Equilibrium in Insurance Markets**:\n  - If insurers cannot distinguish risk types, they may set a **pooled premium**, leading to:\n    - **Low-risk individuals opting out** (if premium > willingness to pay).\n    - **Market collapse** if only high-risk individuals remain.\n\n#### **Key Equations/Calculations:**\n- **Expected Cost for Insurer**:\n  - If both types buy insurance at price \\( P \\):\n    \\[\n    \\text{Expected Cost} = 0.5 \\times (\\text{Cost}_{\\text{low-risk}}) + 0.5 \\times (\\text{Cost}_{\\text{high-risk}})\n    \\]\n  - Example (Q2, Q3):\n    - At \\( P = 1000 \\):\n      \\[\n      \\text{Expected Cost} = 0.5 \\times 500 + 0.5 \\times 1200 = 850 < 1000 \\quad (\\text{Profit})\n      \\]\n      But if only high-risk buy:\n      \\[\n      \\text{Expected Cost} = 1200 > 1000 \\quad (\\text{Loss})\n      \\]\n- **Surplus Calculation**:\n  - **Total Surplus** = (Willingness to Pay - Cost) for all insured individuals.\n  - Example (Q3):\n    - At \\( P = 1300 \\), only high-risk buy:\n      \\[\n      \\text{Surplus} = (1500 - 1300) \\times 50 = 10,000\n      \\]\n\n---\n\n### **2. Externalities & Social Efficiency**\n#### **Key Concepts:**\n- **Positive Externality**: Benefit to a third party (e.g., beekeeping pollinates orchards, Q4, Q5).\n- **Private vs. Social Marginal Cost/Benefit**:\n  - **Private MC**: Cost borne by the producer (e.g., \\( MC = 10 + 5Q \\)).\n  - **Social MC**: Private MC minus external benefit (e.g., savings from natural pollination).\n- **Socially Efficient Quantity**: Where **Social MB = Social MC**.\n\n#### **Key Equations/Calculations:**\n- **Private Optimum (Ignore Externality)**:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Set } P = MC \\implies 40 = 10 + 5Q \\implies Q = 6\n  \\]\n- **Social Optimum (Include Externality)**:\n  - External benefit = \\( \\$10 \\) per hive (saves artificial pollination).\n  - **Social MB** = Private MB (\\( \\$40 \\)) + External Benefit (\\( \\$10 \\)) = \\( \\$50 \\).\n  \\[\n  50 = 10 + 5Q \\implies Q = 8\n  \\]\n\n---\n\n### **3. Monopoly & Market Power**\n#### **Key Concepts:**\n- **Profit Maximization**: \\( MR = MC \\).\n- **Lerner Index**: Measures monopoly power:\n  \\[\n  L = \\frac{P - MC}{P}\n  \\]\n- **Demand Curve**: \\( P = 11 - Q \\) (Q6\u2013Q8).\n\n#### **Key Equations/Calculations:**\n- **Total Revenue (TR)**:\n  \\[\n  TR = P \\times Q = (11 - Q) \\times Q = 11Q - Q^2\n  \\]\n- **Marginal Revenue (MR)**:\n  \\[\n  MR = \\frac{d(TR)}{dQ} = 11 - 2Q\n  \\]\n- **Profit Maximization**:\n  \\[\n  MR = MC \\implies 11 - 2Q = 6 \\implies Q = 2.5 \\text{ (thousands)}\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  P = 11 - 2.5 = 8.5\n  \\]\n- **Profit**:\n  \\[\n  \\pi = TR - TC = (8.5 \\times 2500) - (6 \\times 2500) = 6,250\n  \\]\n- **Lerner Index**:\n  \\[\n  L = \\frac{8.5 - 6}{8.5} = 0.294\n  \\]\n\n---\n\n### **4. Oligopoly & Game Theory**\n#### **Key Models:**\n1. **Cournot Competition** (Simultaneous quantity-setting, Q9\u2013Q13).\n2. **Stackelberg Competition** (Sequential quantity-setting, Q14\u2013Q18).\n\n#### **Key Concepts:**\n- **Nash Equilibrium**: Neither firm can increase profit by unilaterally changing output.\n- **Reaction Functions**: How one firm responds to the other\u2019s output.\n- **First-Mover Advantage**: Stackelberg leader produces more than Cournot equilibrium.\n\n#### **Key Equations/Calculations (Cournot):**\n- **Market Demand**: \\( Q_1 + Q_2 = 53 - P \\implies P = 53 - Q_1 - Q_2 \\).\n- **Profit for Firm 1**:\n  \\[\n  \\pi_1 = (P - MC) \\times Q_1 = (53 - Q_1 - Q_2 - 5) \\times Q_1\n  \\]\n- **Best Response Function**:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{d\\pi_1}{dQ_1} = 48 - 2Q_1 - Q_2 = 0 \\implies Q_1 = \\frac{48 - Q_2}{2}\n  \\]\n  Symmetry implies \\( Q_1 = Q_2 = 16 \\).\n- **Equilibrium Price**:\n  \\[\n  P = 53 - 16 - 16 = 21\n  \\]\n- **Profit**:\n  \\[\n  \\pi_1 = (21 - 5) \\times 16 = 256\n  \\]\n\n#### **Stackelberg Competition (Q14\u2013Q18):**\n- **Leader (Firm 1) Anticipates Follower\u2019s Response**:\n  - Firm 2\u2019s reaction: \\( Q_2 = \\frac{48 - Q_1}{2} \\).\n  - Firm 1\u2019s profit:\n    \\[\n    \\pi_1 = (53 - Q_1 - \\frac{48 - Q_1}{2} - 5) \\times Q_1\n    \\]\n  - Solve for \\( Q_1 = 24 \\), \\( Q_2 = 12 \\), \\( P = 17 \\).\n  - Profits: \\( \\pi_1 = 288 \\), \\( \\pi_2 = 144 \\).\n\n---\n\n### **5. Tax Incidence & Welfare Economics**\n#### **Key Concepts:**\n- **Tax Incidence**: How tax burden is split between buyers and sellers.\n- **Deadweight Loss (DWL)**: Loss in total surplus due to tax.\n- **Consumer/Producer Surplus**:\n  - **CS**: Area under demand curve and above price.\n  - **PS**: Area above supply curve and below price.\n\n#### **Key Equations/Calculations (Q26\u2013Q35):**\n- **Demand**: \\( P = 300 - Q \\).\n- **Supply**: \\( P = 60 + 2Q \\).\n- **Equilibrium Before Tax**:\n  \\[\n  300 - Q = 60 + 2Q \\implies Q = 80, P = 220\n  \\]\n- **CS Before Tax**:\n  \\[\n  CS = \\frac{1}{2} \\times (300 - 220) \\times 80 = 3,200\n  \\]\n- **PS Before Tax**:\n  \\[\n  PS = \\frac{1}{2} \\times (220 - 60) \\times 80 = 6,400\n  \\]\n- **After Tax (\\( t = 15 \\))**:\n  - New supply: \\( P = 75 + 2Q \\).\n  - New equilibrium:\n    \\[\n    300 - Q = 75 + 2Q \\implies Q = 75, P_b = 225, P_s = 210\n    \\]\n- **Tax Revenue**:\n  \\[\n  T = t \\times Q = 15 \\times 75 = 1,125\n  \\]\n- **DWL**:\n  \\[\n  DWL = \\frac{1}{2} \\times t \\times \\Delta Q = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 15 \\times 5 = 37.5\n  \\]\n\n---\n\n### **6. Monopolistic Competition & Preferences**\n#### **Key Concepts (Q36\u2013Q38):**\n- **Monopolistic Competition**:\n  - Differentiated products.\n  - Free entry/exit \u2192 zero economic profit in long run.\n- **Utility Functions**:\n  - **Quasi-Linear**: Linear in one good (e.g., \\( U = \\sqrt{x} + y \\)).\n  - **Cobb-Douglas**: \\( U = x^a y^b \\).\n    - Returns to scale depend on \\( a + b \\):\n      - \\( a + b = 1 \\): Constant.\n      - \\( a + b > 1 \\): Increasing.\n      - \\( a + b < 1 \\): Decreasing.\n\n---\n\n### **7. Price Discrimination**\n#### **Key Concepts (Q39):**\n- **First-Degree**: Charge each consumer their reservation price.\n- **Second-Degree**: Quantity discounts (e.g., bulk pricing).\n- **Third-Degree**: Different prices for different groups (e.g., student discounts).\n\n---\n\n## **Mermaid Knowledge Graphs**\n### **1.
