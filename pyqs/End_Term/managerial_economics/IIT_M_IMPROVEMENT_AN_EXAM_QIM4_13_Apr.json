The orchard owner pays nothing for this service, however, because the bees come to the orchard without him having to do anything. Because there are not enough bees to pollinate the entire orchard, the orchard owner must complete the pollination by artificial means, at a cost of $10 per acre of trees. \nBeekeeping has a marginal cost MC = 10 + 5Q, where Q is the number of beehives. Each hive yields $40 worth of honey. \nBased on the above data, answer the given subquestions."

The second dealership, Latif\u2019s Motors, always sells lower-quality cars. On average, it costs Latif\u2019s only $4000 for each car that it sells. If consumers knew the quality of the used cars they were buying, they would pay $9,000 on average for Hamid\u2019s cars and only $6000 on average for Latif\u2019s cars. Without more information, consumers do not know the quality of each dealership\u2019s cars. In this case, they would figure that they have a 50-50 chance of ending up with a high quality car, and are thus willing to pay $7500 for a car. Hamid has an idea: He will offer a bumper-to-bumper warranty for all cars he sells. He knows that a warranty lasting <b>Y</b> years will cost <b>$500Y</b> on average, and he also knows that if Latif tries to offer the same warranty, it will cost Latif <b>$1000Y</b> on average.

The second dealership, Latif\u2019s Motors, always sells lower-quality cars. On average, it costs Latif\u2019s only $4000 for each car that it sells.

Without more information, consumers do not know the quality of each dealership\u2019s cars. In this case, they would figure that they have a 50-50 chance of ending up with a high quality car, and are thus willing to pay $7500 for a car.

        "summary": "Here\u2019s a structured **summary of core topics, concepts, principles, and equations** for the **Managerial Economics** exam, followed by **Mermaid knowledge graphs** to visualize relationships.\n\n---\n\n---\n\n### **Core Topics & Key Concepts**\n#### **1. Asymmetric Information & Market Failures**\n   - **Adverse Selection**:\n     - Occurs when one party (e.g., insurer) cannot distinguish between high-risk and low-risk customers.\n     - Example: Insurance markets where high-risk individuals are more likely to buy insurance.\n     - **Key Idea**: Market may collapse if premiums are set based on average risk (e.g., Q2, Q3).\n     - **Equations**:\n       - Expected cost for insurer = `(Probability_high_risk * Cost_high_risk) + (Probability_low_risk * Cost_low_risk)`.\n       - Surplus = `Willingness to pay - Price`.\n\n   - **Moral Hazard**:\n     - Occurs when one party (e.g., insured) changes behavior after entering a contract (e.g., taking more risks).\n     - Example: Car insurance leading to reckless driving (Q40).\n     - **Key Idea**: Contracts must align incentives (e.g., deductibles, warranties).\n\n   - **Signaling**:\n     - High-quality parties signal their type to differentiate from low-quality (e.g., warranties in Q19\u2013Q25).\n     - **Equations**:\n       - Profit with warranty = `Price - Cost - Warranty Cost`.\n       - Credible signal: Cost of signaling must be lower for high-quality sellers.\n\n---\n#### **2. Market Structures**\n   - **Monopoly**:\n     - Single seller, price maker.\n     - **Profit Maximization**: `MR = MC`.\n     - **Equations** (Q6\u2013Q8):\n       - Demand: `P = 11 - Q`.\n       - Total Revenue (`TR`) = `P * Q = 11Q - Q\u00b2`.\n       - Marginal Revenue (`MR`) = `11 - 2Q`.\n       - Marginal Cost (`MC`) = `6` (constant).\n       - Profit-maximizing condition: `11 - 2Q = 6 \u2192 Q* = 2.5` (thousands), `P* = 8.5`.\n       - Profit = `TR - TC = (8.5 * 2.5) - (6 * 2.5) = 6.25` (thousands) \u2192 **$6,250** (Option B in Q7).\n       - **Lerner Index** (degree of monopoly power):\n         `L = (P - MC)/P = (8.5 - 6)/8.5 \u2248 0.294` (Q8).\n\n   - **Cournot Duopoly**:\n     - Firms compete by simultaneously choosing quantities.\n     - **Equations** (Q9\u2013Q13):\n       - Demand: `P = 53 - Q1 - Q2`.\n       - `MC = AC = 5`.\n       - Firm 1\u2019s profit: `\u03c01 = (53 - Q1 - Q2 - 5) * Q1 = (48 - Q2 - Q1) * Q1`.\n       - Best response: `\u2202\u03c01/\u2202Q1 = 48 - Q2 - 2Q1 = 0 \u2192 Q1* = (48 - Q2)/2`.\n       - Symmetric equilibrium: `Q1* = Q2* = 16`, `P* = 21`, `\u03c01 = \u03c02 = 256`.\n\n   - **Stackelberg Duopoly**:\n     - Leader (Firm 1) moves first; follower (Firm 2) responds.\n     - **Equations** (Q14\u2013Q18):\n       - Firm 2\u2019s reaction function: `Q2 = (48 - Q1)/2`.\n       - Firm 1\u2019s profit: `\u03c01 = (53 - Q1 - (48 - Q1)/2 - 5) * Q1`.\n       - Solve: `Q1* = 24`, `Q2* = 12`, `P* = 17`, `\u03c01 = 288`, `\u03c02 = 144`.\n\n   - **Monopolistic Competition**:\n     - **Key Features** (Q36):\n       - Differentiated products (high substitutability).\n       - Free entry/exit \u2192 zero economic profit in long run.\n\n---\n#### **3. Externalities & Social Efficiency**\n   - **Positive Externality**:\n     - Example: Beekeeping benefits apple orchard (Q4, Q5).\n     - **Socially Efficient Quantity**: Include external benefits in `MC`.\n     - **Equations**:\n       - Private `MC_beekeeping = 10 + 5Q`.\n       - External benefit: `$10/acre` (saved artificial pollination cost).\n       - Social `MC = 10 + 5Q - 10 = 5Q` (set `P = 40` for honey).\n       - Solve: `5Q = 40 \u2192 Q* = 8` (socially efficient).\n       - Private equilibrium (ignore orchard): `10 + 5Q = 40 \u2192 Q* = 6`.\n\n---\n#### **4. Tax Incidence & Welfare Analysis**\n   - **Tax on Pizzas** (Q26\u2013Q35):\n     - Demand: `P = 300 - Q`.\n     - Supply: `P = 60 + 2Q`.\n     - Tax: `t = 15` per unit.\n     - **Equations**:\n       - **Before Tax**:\n         - Equilibrium: `300 - Q = 60 + 2Q \u2192 Q* = 80`, `P* = 220`.\n         - Consumer Surplus (`CS`) = `\u00bd * (300 - 220) * 80 = 3,200` (Q27).\n         - Producer Surplus (`PS`) = `\u00bd * (220 - 60) * 80 = 6,400` (Q28).\n       - **After Tax**:\n         - New supply: `P = 60 + 2Q + 15 = 75 + 2Q`.\n         - Equilibrium: `300 - Q = 75 + 2Q \u2192 Q* = 75`, `P_buyer = 225`, `P_seller = 210`.\n         - **Tax Revenue** = `t * Q* = 15 * 75 = 1,125` (Q34).\n         - **Deadweight Loss (`DWL`)** = `\u00bd * t * \u0394Q = \u00bd * 15 * 5 = 37.5` (Q35).\n         - **Loss in CS** = `\u00bd * (225 - 220) * 75 + \u00bd * (300 - 225) * (80 - 75) = 387.5` (Q32).\n         - **Loss in PS** = `\u00bd * (220 - 210) * 75 + \u00bd * (210 - 60) * (80 - 75) = 775` (Q33).\n\n---\n#### **5. Consumer Preferences & Production Functions**\n   - **Quasi-Linear Preferences** (Q37):\n     - Linear in one good (e.g., `U = x + \u221ay`).\n   - **Cobb-Douglas Production** (Q38):\n     - `F(K, L) = K^p L^q`.\n     - Returns to scale:\n       - Increasing if `p + q > 1`,\n       - Decreasing if `p + q < 1`,\n       - Constant if `p + q = 1`.\n\n---\n#### **6. Price Discrimination** (Q39)\n   - **First-Degree**: Charge each consumer their reservation price.\n   - **Second-Degree**: Quantity discounts (non-linear pricing).\n   - **Third-Degree**: Segment markets (e.g., student discounts).\n\n---\n\n---\n### **Mermaid Knowledge Graphs**\n#### **Graph 1: Market Structures**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Market Structures] --> B[Perfect Competition]\n    A --> C[Monopoly]\n    A --> D[Oligopoly]\n    A --> E[Monopolistic Competition]\n\n    C --> C1[Single Seller]\n    C --> C2[Price Maker]\n    C --> C3[Barriers to Entry]\n    C --> C4[Profit Maximization: MR=MC]\n\n    D --> D1[Few Sellers]\n    D --> D2[Cournot Model]\n    D --> D3[Stackelberg Model]\n    D --> D4[Strategic Interaction]\n\n    E --> E1[Differentiated Products]\n    E --> E2[Free Entry/Exit]\n    E --> E3[Zero Long-Run Profit]\n```\n\n#### **Graph 2: Asymmetric Information**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Asymmetric Information] --> B[Adverse Selection]\n    A --> C[Moral Hazard]\n    A --> D[Signaling]\n\n    B --> B1[Hidden Information]\n    B --> B2[Market Collapse]\n    B --> B3[Insurance Example]\n\n    C --> C1[Hidden Action]\n    C --> C2[Post-Contract Behavior]\n    C --> C3[Insurance Fraud]\n\n    D --> D1[Warranties]\n    D --> D2[Education as Signal]\n    D --> D3[Credible vs. Non-Credible]\n```\n\n#### **Graph 3: Tax Incidence & Welfare**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Tax Incidence] --> B[Consumer Surplus]\n    A --> C[Producer Surplus]\n    A --> D[Tax Revenue]\n    A --> E[Deadweight Loss]\n\n    B --> B1[Loss Due to Tax]\n    C --> C1[Loss Due to Tax]\n    D --> D1[t * Q_post_tax]\n    E --> E1[\u00bd * t * \u0394Q]\n```\n\n#### **Graph 4: Externalities**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Externalities] --> B[Positive Externality]\n    A --> C[Negative Externality]\n\n    B --> B1[Social Benefit > Private Benefit]\n    B --> B2[Beekeeping Example]\n    B --> B3[Subsidies]\n\n    C --> C1[Social Cost > Private Cost]\n    C --> C2[Pollution Example]\n    C --> C3[Taxes]\n```\n\n#### **Graph 5: Game Theory (Cournot/Stackelberg)**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Oligopoly Models] --> B[Cournot]\n    A --> C[Stackelberg]\n\n    B --> B1[Simultaneous Quantity Choice]\n    B --> B2[Nash Equilibrium]\n    B --> B3[Symmetry: Q1=Q2]\n\n    C --> C1[Sequential Moves]\n    C --> C2[Leader-Follower]\n    C --> C3[First-Mover Advantage]\n```\n\n---\n### **Key Equations Summary**\n| **Topic**               | **Equation**                                                                 | **Example**                          |\n|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Monopoly Profit Max      | `MR = MC`, `MR = dTR/dQ`                                                    | `11 - 2Q = 6 \u2192 Q* = 2.5`             |\n| Lerner Index            | `L = (P - MC)/P`                                                            | `(8.5 - 6)/8.5 \u2248 0.294`              |\n| Cournot Equilibrium     | `Q1* = (a - c - Q2)/2b` (for linear demand `P = a - bQ`)                   | `Q1* = (48 - Q2)/2`                  |\n| Stackelberg Leader      | Solve `\u03c01 = (a - c - Q2(Q1) - Q1) * Q1`                                     | `Q1* = 24`, `Q2* = 12`               |\n| Tax Incidence           | `Q_post_tax = (a - (c + t))/(b + d)` (demand: `P = a - bQ`, supply: `P = c + dQ`) | `Q* = 75`                            |\n| Consumer Surplus        | `CS = \u00bd * (Max P - P*) * Q*`                                                | `CS = \u00bd * (300 - 220) * 80 = 3,200`  |\n| Deadweight Loss         | `DWL = \u00bd * t * \u0394Q`                                                          | `DWL = \u00bd * 15 * 5 = 37.5`            |\n| Adverse Selection       | `Expected Cost = \u03a3 (Prob_i * Cost_i)`                                       | `E[Cost] = 0.5*1200 + 0.5*500 = 850` |\n| Signaling                | `Profit_with_signal = Price - Cost - Signal_Cost`                          | `\u03c0 = 9000 - 7000 - 500 = 1500`       |",
