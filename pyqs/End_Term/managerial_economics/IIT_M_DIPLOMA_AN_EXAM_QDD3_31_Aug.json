                            "Imagine that you have been working after college and now face the decision of whether or not to get an MBA at a prestigious institution. The cost of getting the MBA is 10. (Again, you can decide on the denomination, but rest assured that this sum includes the income lost over the course of the two years you will be studying!) Your future value is your stream of income, which depends on the strength of the labor market for the next decade. If the labor market is strong then your income value from having an MBA is 32, while your income value from your current status is 12. If the labor market is average then your income value from having an MBA is 16, while your income value from your current status is 8. If the labor market is weak then your income value from having an MBA is 12, while your income value from your current status is 4. Further assume that the probability of a strong labor market is p, of an average labor market is 0.5 and of a weak labor market is 0.5\u2212 p. \nBased on the above data, answer the given subquestions.

Monopoly & Pricing Strategies**\n#### **Key Concepts:**\n- **Profit Maximization**: \\( MR = MC \\)\n- **Price Elasticity of Demand (PED)**:\n  - \\( PED = \\frac{\\% \\Delta Q_d}{\\% \\Delta P} \\)\n  - For monopolists: \\( P(1 + \\frac{1}{PED}) = MC \\)\n- **Markup Pricing**:\n  - \\( \\text{Markup} = \\frac{P - MC}{P} \\times 100 \\)\n- **First-Degree Price Discrimination**:\n  - Charging each consumer their **reservation price** (max willingness to pay).\n  - **Pareto Efficient** (no deadweight loss).\n\n#### **Equations:**\n1. **Marginal Revenue (MR) for Linear Demand \\( P = a - bQ \\)**:\n   \\[ MR = a - 2bQ \\]\n2. **Monopolist\u2019s Profit**:\n   \\[ \\pi = TR - TC = P(Q) \\cdot Q - C(Q) \\]\n3. **Lerner Index (Markup)**:\n   \\[ L = \\frac{P - MC}{P} = -\\frac{1}{PED} \\]\n\n---\n\n### **2. Game Theory & Asymmetric Information**\n#### **Key Concepts:**\n- **Adverse Selection**:\n  - Occurs when **one party has private information** (e.g., Latif\u2019s Motors selling low-quality cars).\n  - **Solution**: Signaling (e.g., warranties).\n- **Moral Hazard**:\n  - Occurs when **contracts lead to risky behavior** (e.g., insured drivers driving recklessly).\n- **Signaling & Screening**:\n  - **Warranties as a signal** (Hamid\u2019s high-quality cars vs. Latif\u2019s low-quality cars).\n  - **Cost of signaling must be lower for high-quality sellers**.\n\n#### **Equations:**\n1. **Expected Profit with Warranty**:\n   \\[ \\text{Profit} = \\text{Price} - \\text{Cost} - \\text{Warranty Cost} \\]\n   - For Hamid: \\( \\text{Warranty Cost} = 500Y \\)\n   - For Latif: \\( \\text{Warranty Cost} = 1000Y \\)\n\n---\n\n### **3. Supply, Demand, and Market Equilibrium**\n#### **Key Concepts:**\n- **Equilibrium**: \\( Q^d = Q^s \\)\n- **Consumer Surplus (CS)**:\n  \\[ CS = \\frac{1}{2} \\times Q^* \\times (P_{\\text{max}} - P^*) \\]\n- **Producer Surplus (PS)**:\n  \\[ PS = \\frac{1}{2} \\times Q^* \\times (P^* - P_{\\text{min}}) \\]\n- **Tax Incidence**:\n  - **Burden shared** between buyers and sellers based on elasticity.\n  - **Deadweight Loss (DWL)**: Loss in total surplus due to tax.\n\n#### **Equations:**\n1. **Equilibrium with Demand \\( Q^d = a - bP \\) & Supply \\( Q^s = c + dP \\)**:\n   \\[ a - bP = c + dP \\]\n   \\[ P^* = \\frac{a - c}{b + d} \\]\n2. **Tax Effect on Price**:\n   - Buyer pays: \\( P_d = P^* + t_b \\)\n   - Seller receives: \\( P_s = P^* - t_s \\)\n   - Total tax: \\( t = t_b + t_s \\)\n3. **Deadweight Loss (DWL)**:\n   \\[ DWL = \\frac{1}{2} \\times t \\times \\Delta Q \\]\n\n---\n\n### **4. International Trade & Tariffs**\n#### **Key Concepts:**\n- **Free Trade vs. Tariffs**:\n  - **Tariff increases domestic price**, reduces imports.\n  - **Government Revenue from Tariff**: \\( \\text{Tariff} \\times \\text{Quantity Imported} \\)\n- **Welfare Effects**:\n  - **Consumers lose** (higher prices, lower CS).\n  - **Producers gain** (higher PS).\n  - **Government gains** (tariff revenue).\n  - **Net welfare loss** (DWL).\n\n#### **Equations:**\n1. **Imports with Tariff**:\n   \\[ Q_{\\text{import}} = Q^d(P + t) - Q^s(P + t) \\]\n2. **Government Revenue**:\n   \\[ \\text{Revenue} = t \\times Q_{\\text{import}} \\]\n\n---\n\n### **5. Externalities & Social Efficiency**\n#### **Key Concepts:**\n- **Positive Externality** (e.g., beekeeping benefits apple orchard).\n- **Socially Efficient Quantity**: Where \\( \\text{MSB} = \\text{MSC} \\).\n- **Private vs. Social Marginal Cost/Benefit**:\n  - **Private MC**: \\( MC_{\\text{private}} = 10 + 5Q \\)\n  - **Social MC**: Includes external benefits (e.g., pollination saves orchard \\( \\$10 \\) per acre).\n\n#### **Equations:**\n1. **Socially Efficient Quantity**:\n   \\[ \\text{MSB} = \\text{MSC} \\]\n   \\[ 30 + 10 = 10 + 5Q \\]\n   \\[ Q^* = 6 \\]\n\n---\n\n### **6. Decision Making Under Uncertainty**\n#### **Key Concepts:**\n- **Expected Utility Theory**:\n  - Compare **expected payoffs** under different states (e.g., MBA decision).\n- **Risk Neutrality**:\n  - Choose option with **highest expected value**.\n\n#### **Equations:**\n1. **Expected Value of MBA**:\n   \\[ EV(\\text{MBA}) = p \\times 32 + 0.5 \\times 16 + (0.5 - p) \\times 12 - 10 \\]\n2. **Expected Value of No MBA**:\n   \\[ EV(\\text{No MBA}) = p \\times 12 + 0.5 \\times 8 + (0.5 - p) \\times 4 \\]\n\n---\n\n### **7. Monopolistic Competition**\n#### **Key Concepts:**\n- **Differentiated Products** (e.g., apartments with different features).\n- **Free Entry/Exit**: Profits driven to zero in long run.\n- **Excess Capacity**: Firms produce below minimum efficient scale.\n\n---\n\n## **Mermaid Knowledge Graphs**\n### **Graph 1: Monopoly & Pricing**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Monopoly] --> B[Profit Maximization: MR = MC]\n    A --> C[Price Elasticity of Demand]\n    C --> D[PED = -2 \u2192 MC = 20]\n    A --> E[Markup Pricing]\n    E --> F[Lerner Index: (P-MC)/P = -1/PED]\n    A --> G[First-Degree Price Discrimination]\n    G --> H[Pareto Efficient]\n```\n\n### **Graph 2: Game Theory & Asymmetric Information**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Asymmetric Information] --> B[Adverse Selection]\n    B --> C[Latif sells low-quality cars]\n    A --> D[Moral Hazard]\n    D --> E[Insurance leads to riskier behavior]\n    A --> F[Signaling]\n    F --> G[Hamid offers warranty]\n    G --> H[Credible if costly for Latif]\n```\n\n### **Graph 3: Supply, Demand, and Taxes**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Market Equilibrium] --> B[Qd = Qs]\n    A --> C[Tax Incidence]\n    C --> D[Buyer pays Pb = P* + tb]\n    C --> E[Seller receives Ps = P* - ts]\n    C --> F[Deadweight Loss]\n    A --> G[Consumer & Producer Surplus]\n    G --> H[CS = \u00bd \u00d7 Q \u00d7 (Pmax - P*)]\n    G --> I[PS = \u00bd \u00d7 Q \u00d7 (P* - Pmin)]\n```\n\n### **Graph 4: International Trade & Tariffs**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Free Trade] --> B[World Price = \u20b920]\n    A --> C[Imports = Qd - Qs at P=20]\n    D[Tariff] --> E[Domestic Price Rises]\n    E --> F[Imports Decrease]\n    E --> G[Government Revenue = t \u00d7 Qimport]\n    E --> H[Deadweight Loss]\n```\n\n### **Graph 5: Externalities & Social Efficiency**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Beekeeping Externality] --> B[Private MC = 10 + 5Q]\n    A --> C[Social Benefit = Honey + Pollination]\n    C --> D[MSB = MSC at Q=6]\n    A --> E[Market Failure]\n    E --> F[Underproduction without intervention]\n```\n\n### **Graph 6: Decision Under Uncertainty (MBA Choice)**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[MBA Decision] --> B[Expected Value Calculation]\n    B --> C[EV(MBA) = p\u00d732 + 0.5\u00d716 + (0.5-p)\u00d712 - 10]\n    B --> D[EV(No MBA) = p\u00d712 + 0.5\u00d78 + (0.5-p)\u00d74]\n    A --> E[Compare EV]\n    E --> F[Choose if EV(MBA) > EV(No MBA)]\n```\n\n---\n## **Key Equations Summary**\n| **Topic**               | **Equation**                                                                 |\n|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Monopoly MR**         | \\( MR = a - 2bQ \\) (for \\( P = a - bQ \\))                                  |\n| **Lerner Index**        | \\( L = \\frac{P - MC}{P} = -\\frac{1}{PED} \\)                                |\n| **Profit Maximization** | \\( \\pi = PQ - C(Q) \\)                                                      |\n| **Tax Incidence**       | \\( P_b = P^* + t_b \\), \\( P_s = P^* - t_s \\)                               |\n| **Deadweight Loss**     | \\( DWL = \\frac{1}{2} \\times t \\times \\Delta Q \\)                           |\n| **Consumer Surplus**     | \\( CS = \\frac{1}{2} \\times Q^* \\times (P_{\\text{max}} - P^*) \\)            |\n| **Producer Surplus**     | \\( PS = \\frac{1}{2} \\times Q^* \\times (P^* - P_{\\text{min}}) \\)            |\n| **Tariff Revenue**      | \\( \\text{Revenue} = t \\times Q_{\\text{import}} \\)                         |\n| **Social Efficiency**   | \\( \\text{MSB} = \\text{MSC} \\)                                              |\n| **Expected Value**      | \\( EV = \\sum p_i \\times \\text{Payoff}_i \\)                                 |\n\n---\n## **Exam Strategy**\n1. **Monopoly Problems**:\n   - Always start with \\( MR = MC \\).\n   - Use \\( PED \\) to find \\( MC \\) if given.\n   - Calculate markup using \\( \\frac{P - MC}{P} \\).\n\n2. **Game Theory**:\n   - Identify **signaling costs** (e.g., warranty costs for Hamid vs. Latif).\n   - Check if the signal is **credible** (costlier for low-quality sellers).\n\n3. **Taxes & Tariffs**:\n   - Find **new equilibrium** after tax/tariff.\n   - Calculate **CS, PS, DWL, and government revenue**.\n\n4. **Externalities**:\n   - Compare **private vs. social costs/benefits**.\n   - Find \\( Q \\) where \\( \\text{MSB} = \\text{MSC} \\).\n\n5. **Uncertainty**:\n   - Compute **expected values** for each option.\n   - Choose the **higher EV**.\n\n---\nThis summary covers **all major topics** in the exam.
