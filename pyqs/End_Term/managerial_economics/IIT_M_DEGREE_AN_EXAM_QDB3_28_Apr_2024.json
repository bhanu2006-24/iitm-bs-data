The first, Hamid\u2019s Cars, always sells high-quality cars that it carefully inspects and, if necessary, services. On average, it costs Hamid\u2019s $8000 to buy and service each car that it sells. The second dealership, Latif\u2019s Motors, always sells lower-quality cars. On average, it costs Latif\u2019s only $5000 for each car that it sells. If consumers knew the quality of the used cars they were buying, they would pay $10,000 on average for Hamid\u2019s cars and only $7000 on average for Latif\u2019s cars. Without more information, consumers do not know the quality of each dealership\u2019s cars. In this case, they would figure that they have a 50-50 chance of ending up with a high quality car, and are thus willing to pay $8500 for a car. Hamid has an idea: He will offer a bumper-to-bumper warranty for all cars he sells. He knows that a warranty lasting Y years will cost $500Y on average, and he also knows that if Latif tries to offer the same warranty, it will cost Latif $1000Y on average.  Suppose Hamid offers a one-year warranty on all of the cars he sells.  Based on the above data, answer the given subquestions."

                            "Two used car dealerships compete side by side on a main road. The first, Hamid\u2019s Cars, always sells high-quality cars that it carefully inspects and, if necessary, services. On average, it costs Hamid\u2019s $8000 to buy and service each car that it sells. The second dealership, Latif\u2019s Motors, always sells lower-quality cars. On average, it costs Latif\u2019s only $5000 for each car that it sells. If consumers knew the quality of the used cars they were buying, they would pay $10,000 on average for Hamid\u2019s cars and only $7000 on average for Latif\u2019s cars. Without more information, consumers do not know the quality of each dealership\u2019s cars. In this case, they would figure that they have a 50-50 chance of ending up with a high quality car, and are thus willing to pay $8500 for a car. Hamid has an idea: He will offer a bumper-to-bumper warranty for all cars he sells. He knows that a warranty lasting Y years will cost $500Y on average, and he also knows that if Latif tries to offer the same warranty, it will cost Latif $1000Y on average.  Suppose Hamid offers a one-year warranty on all of the cars he sells.  Based on the above data, answer the given subquestions."
