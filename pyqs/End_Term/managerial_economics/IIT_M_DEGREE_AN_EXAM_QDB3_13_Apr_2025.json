The orchard owner pays nothing for this service, however, because the bees come to the orchard without him having to do anything. Because there are not enough bees to pollinate the entire orchard, the orchard owner must complete the pollination by artificial means, at a cost of $10 per acre of trees. \nBeekeeping has a marginal cost MC = 10 + 5Q, where Q is the number of beehives. Each hive yields $40 worth of honey. \nBased on the above data, answer the given subquestions."

The second dealership, Latif\u2019s Motors, always sells lower-quality cars. On average, it costs Latif\u2019s only $4000 for each car that it sells. If consumers knew the quality of the used cars they were buying, they would pay $9,000 on average for Hamid\u2019s cars and only $6000 on average for Latif\u2019s cars. Without more information, consumers do not know the quality of each dealership\u2019s cars. In this case, they would figure that they have a 50-50 chance of ending up with a high quality car, and are thus willing to pay $7500 for a car. Hamid has an idea: He will offer a bumper-to-bumper warranty for all cars he sells. He knows that a warranty lasting <b>Y</b> years will cost <b>$500Y</b> on average, and he also knows that if Latif tries to offer the same warranty, it will cost Latif <b>$1000Y</b> on average.

        "summary": "Here\u2019s a structured **summary of core topics, concepts, principles, and equations** for the **Managerial Economics (Computer-Based Exam)**, along with **Mermaid knowledge graphs** to visualize relationships.\n\n---\n\n## **Core Topics & Key Concepts**\n### **1. Asymmetric Information & Market Failures**\n#### **Key Concepts:**\n- **Adverse Selection**: High-risk individuals are more likely to purchase insurance (e.g., Q2, Q3, Q40).\n  - Example: High-risk people buy insurance at a price that causes losses for insurers.\n- **Moral Hazard**: Individuals change behavior after entering a contract (e.g., taking more risks because they are insured) (Q41).\n- **Signaling & Screening**:\n  - **Signaling**: High-quality sellers use warranties to distinguish themselves (e.g., Hamid\u2019s Cars offering warranties to signal quality) (Q19\u2013Q25).\n  - **Screening**: Buyers or insurers use mechanisms (e.g., prices, tests) to differentiate types.\n- **Lemon\u2019s Problem**: When buyers cannot distinguish quality, low-quality goods drive out high-quality ones (Akerlof\u2019s model).\n\n#### **Equations/Calculations:**\n- **Expected Costs & Profits Under Asymmetric Information**:\n  - If insurers cannot distinguish risk types, they set a **pooled price**:\n    \\[\n    P_{\\text{pooled}} = \\frac{(N_{\\text{low}} \\times C_{\\text{low}}) + (N_{\\text{high}} \\times C_{\\text{high}})}{N_{\\text{total}}}\n    \\]\n    (Where \\(N\\) = number of people, \\(C\\) = cost per type)\n  - **Surplus Calculation**:\n    - **Low-risk surplus** = Willingness to pay (\\(WTP_{\\text{low}}\\)) \u2013 Pooled price.\n    - **High-risk surplus** = \\(WTP_{\\text{high}}\\) \u2013 Pooled price.\n    - **Total surplus** = Sum of individual surpluses (Q3).\n\n---\n\n### **2. Externalities & Social Efficiency**\n#### **Key Concepts:**\n- **Positive Externality**: Benefit to a third party (e.g., beekeeping pollinates orchards) (Q4, Q5).\n- **Negative Externality**: Cost to a third party (e.g., pollution).\n- **Socially Efficient Quantity**: Where **Marginal Social Benefit (MSB) = Marginal Social Cost (MSC)**.\n- **Private Market Equilibrium**: Where **Marginal Private Benefit (MPB) = Marginal Private Cost (MPC)**.\n\n#### **Equations:**\n- **Marginal Cost (MC) & Marginal Benefit (MB)**:\n  - Given \\(MC = 10 + 5Q\\) (Q4, Q5).\n  - **Socially efficient Q**: Solve \\(MB = MC\\) (including externality).\n    - For beekeeping: \\(MB = 40\\) (honey) + \\(10\\) (pollination benefit) = \\(50\\).\n    - Set \\(50 = 10 + 5Q \\implies Q = 8\\).\n  - **Private Q (ignoring externality)**: \\(40 = 10 + 5Q \\implies Q = 6\\).\n\n---\n\n### **3. Monopoly & Market Power**\n#### **Key Concepts:**\n- **Profit Maximization**: \\(MR = MC\\) (Q6\u2013Q8).\n- **Lerner Index**: Measures monopoly power:\n  \\[\n  L = \\frac{P - MC}{P}\n  \\]\n  (Where \\(P\\) = price, \\(MC\\) = marginal cost) (Q8).\n- **Deadweight Loss (DWL)**: Loss in surplus due to monopoly pricing.\n\n#### **Equations:**\n- **Demand Curve**: \\(P = 11 - Q\\) (Q6\u2013Q8).\n- **Total Revenue (TR)**: \\(TR = P \\times Q = (11 - Q)Q = 11Q - Q^2\\).\n- **Marginal Revenue (MR)**: \\(MR = \\frac{d(TR)}{dQ} = 11 - 2Q\\).\n- **Marginal Cost (MC)**: Given as \\(MC = 6\\) (constant).\n- **Profit Maximization**:\n  \\[\n  MR = MC \\implies 11 - 2Q = 6 \\implies Q = 2.5 \\text{ (thousands)} = 2500 \\text{ units}.\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  P = 11 - 2.5 = 8.5.\n  \\]\n- **Profit**:\n  \\[\n  \\pi = TR - TC = (8.5 \\times 2500) - (6 \\times 2500) = 6250.\n  \\]\n- **Lerner Index**:\n  \\[\n  L = \\frac{8.5 - 6}{8.5} = 0.294.\n  \\]\n\n---\n\n### **4. Oligopoly Models**\n#### **Key Concepts:**\n- **Cournot Competition**: Firms choose quantities simultaneously (Q9\u2013Q13).\n- **Stackelberg Competition**: Leader moves first, follower responds (Q14\u2013Q18).\n- **Nash Equilibrium**: No firm can improve profit by unilaterally changing output.\n\n#### **Equations (Cournot):**\n- **Market Demand**: \\(Q_1 + Q_2 = 53 - P\\) (Q9\u2013Q13).\n- **Reaction Functions**:\n  - Firm 1\u2019s profit: \\(\\pi_1 = (53 - Q_1 - Q_2 - 5)Q_1 = (48 - Q_2 - Q_1)Q_1\\).\n  - Maximize w.r.t. \\(Q_1\\): \\(48 - Q_2 - 2Q_1 = 0 \\implies Q_1 = 24 - 0.5Q_2\\).\n  - Symmetric equilibrium: \\(Q_1 = Q_2 = 16\\).\n- **Equilibrium Price**:\n  \\[\n  P = 53 - Q_1 - Q_2 = 53 - 32 = 21.\n  \\]\n- **Profit per Firm**:\n  \\[\n  \\pi = (21 - 5) \\times 16 = 256.\n  \\]\n\n#### **Equations (Stackelberg):**\n- **Leader (Firm 1) Moves First**:\n  - Firm 2\u2019s reaction: \\(Q_2 = 24 - 0.5Q_1\\).\n  - Firm 1\u2019s profit: \\(\\pi_1 = (48 - Q_2 - Q_1)Q_1 = (48 - (24 - 0.5Q_1) - Q_1)Q_1 = (24 - 0.5Q_1)Q_1\\).\n  - Maximize: \\(24 - Q_1 = 0 \\implies Q_1 = 24\\).\n  - Firm 2\u2019s output: \\(Q_2 = 24 - 0.5 \\times 24 = 12\\).\n- **Market Price**:\n  \\[\n  P = 53 - 24 - 12 = 17.\n  \\]\n- **Profits**:\n  - Firm 1: \\((17 - 5) \\times 24 = 288\\).\n  - Firm 2: \\((17 - 5) \\times 12 = 144\\).\n\n---\n\n### **5. Tax Incidence & Welfare Analysis**\n#### **Key Concepts:**\n- **Tax Incidence**: How tax burden is split between buyers and sellers (Q26\u2013Q35).\n- **Deadweight Loss (DWL)**: Efficiency loss due to taxation.\n- **Consumer/Producer Surplus**: Area under demand/supply curves.\n\n#### **Equations:**\n- **Demand**: \\(P = 300 - Q\\) (Q26\u2013Q35).\n- **Supply**: \\(P = 60 + 2Q\\).\n- **Equilibrium Before Tax**:\n  \\[\n  300 - Q = 60 + 2Q \\implies Q = 80, P = 220.\n  \\]\n- **Consumer Surplus (CS)**:\n  \\[\n  CS = \\frac{1}{2} \\times Q \\times (300 - P) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 80 \\times 80 = 3200.\n  \\]\n- **Producer Surplus (PS)**:\n  \\[\n  PS = \\frac{1}{2} \\times Q \\times (P - 60) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 80 \\times 160 = 6400.\n  \\]\n- **After Tax (\\(t = 15\\))**:\n  - New supply: \\(P = 60 + 2Q + 15 = 75 + 2Q\\).\n  - New equilibrium:\n    \\[\n    300 - Q = 75 + 2Q \\implies Q = 75, P_{\\text{buyer}} = 225, P_{\\text{seller}} = 210.\n    \\]\n- **Tax Revenue**:\n  \\[\n  T = t \\times Q = 15 \\times 75 = 1125.\n  \\]\n- **Deadweight Loss**:\n  \\[\n  DWL = \\frac{1}{2} \\times t \\times \\Delta Q = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 15 \\times (80 - 75) = 37.5.\n  \\]\n\n---\n\n### **6. Monopolistic Competition & Product Differentiation**\n#### **Key Concepts:**\n- **Differentiated Products**: Firms compete on quality, brand, or features (Q36).\n- **Free Entry/Exit**: Profits drive entry until economic profits are zero.\n- **Excess Capacity**: Firms operate at less than minimum efficient scale.\n\n---\n\n### **7. Price Discrimination**\n#### **Key Concepts:**\n- **First-Degree**: Charge each consumer their reservation price (Q39).\n- **Second-Degree**: Quantity discounts (e.g., bulk pricing).\n- **Third-Degree**: Different prices for different groups (e.g., student discounts).\n\n---\n\n### **8. Production Functions**\n#### **Key Concepts:**\n- **Cobb-Douglas**: \\(F(K, L) = K^p L^q\\) (Q38).\n  - **Returns to Scale**:\n    - Increasing: \\(p + q > 1\\).\n    - Decreasing: \\(p + q < 1\\).\n    - Constant: \\(p + q = 1\\).\n\n---\n\n## **Mermaid Knowledge Graphs**\n### **Graph 1: Asymmetric Information & Market Failures**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Asymmetric Information] --> B[Adverse Selection]\n    A --> C[Moral Hazard]\n    B --> D[Insurance Markets]\n    B --> E[Used Cars Lemon Problem]\n    C --> F[Post-Contract Behavior Change]\n    D --> G[Pooled Pricing]\n    D --> H[Separating Equilibrium]\n    E --> I[Signaling]\n    E --> J[Screening]\n    I --> K[Warranties]\n    I --> L[Education Credentials]\n    J --> M[Price Discrimination]\n    J --> N[Tests/Inspections]\n```\n\n### **Graph 2: Market Structures**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Market Structures] --> B[Perfect Competition]\n    A --> C[Monopoly]\n    A --> D[Oligopoly]\n    A --> E[Monopolistic Competition]\n    D --> F[Cournot Model]\n    D --> G[Stackelberg Model]\n    D --> H[Bertrand Model]\n    C --> I[Profit Maximization: MR=MC]\n    C --> J[Lerner Index]\n    F --> K[Simultaneous Quantity Setting]\n    G --> L[Sequential Quantity Setting]\n    E --> M[Product Differentiation]\n    E --> N[Free Entry/Exit]\n```\n\n### **Graph 3: Externalities & Taxation**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Externalities] --> B[Positive Externality]\n    A --> C[Negative Externality]\n    B --> D[Beekeeping & Pollination]\n    C --> E[Pollution]\n    A --> F[Social vs. Private Optimum]\n    F --> G[Marginal Social Cost]\n    F --> H[Marginal Private Cost]\n    A --> I[Government Intervention]\n    I --> J[Taxes]\n    I --> K[Subsidies]\n    J --> L[Tax Incidence]\n    J --> M[Deadweight Loss]\n    L --> N[Consumer Surplus Loss]\n    L --> O[Producer Surplus Loss]\n```\n\n### **Graph 4: Game Theory (Oligopoly)**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Oligopoly] --> B[Cournot Model]\n    A --> C[Stackelberg Model]\n    B --> D[Simultaneous Move Game]\n    D --> E[Nash Equilibrium]\n    C --> F[Sequential Move Game]\n    F --> G[First-Mover Advantage]\n    E --> H[Reaction Functions]\n    G --> I[Leader-Follower Dynamics]\n    H --> J[Profit Maximization]\n    I --> K[Credible Commitments]\n```",
