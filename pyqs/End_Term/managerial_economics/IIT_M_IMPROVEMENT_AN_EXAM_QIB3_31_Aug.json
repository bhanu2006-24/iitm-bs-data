Monopoly & Pricing Strategies**\n#### **Key Concepts:**\n- **Profit Maximization**: \\( MR = MC \\)\n- **Price Elasticity of Demand (PED)**: \\( \\text{PED} = \\frac{\\% \\Delta Q_d}{\\% \\Delta P} \\)\n- **Markup Pricing**: \\( P = \\frac{MC}{1 + \\frac{1}{\\text{PED}}} \\)\n- **Marginal Revenue (MR)**: \\( MR = P \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{\\text{PED}}\\right) \\)\n- **Profit Calculation**: \\( \\text{Profit} = (P - ATC) \\times Q - \\text{Fixed Cost} \\)\n\n#### **Equations:**\n1. **Marginal Cost (MC) from PED**:\n   \\[\n   MC = P \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{\\text{PED}}\\right)\n   \\]\n   *(Given \\( P = 40 \\), \\( \\text{PED} = -2 \\), \\( MC = 20 \\))*\n\n2. **Markup over MC**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Markup (\\%)} = \\left(\\frac{P - MC}{P}\\right) \\times 100\n   \\]\n   *(Given \\( P = 40 \\), \\( MC = 20 \\), Markup = 50%)*\n\n3. **Profit**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Profit} = (P - ATC) \\times Q - \\text{Fixed Cost}\n   \\]\n   *(Given \\( P = 40 \\), \\( ATC = 15 \\), \\( Q = 800 \\), Fixed Cost = 2000 \\), Profit = \u20b920,000)*\n\n---\n\n### **2. Asymmetric Information & Signaling**\n#### **Key Concepts:**\n- **Adverse Selection**: Low-quality products drive out high-quality ones (e.g., used cars).\n- **Moral Hazard**: Risk-taking behavior after a contract is signed (e.g., insurance).\n- **Signaling**: High-quality firms use costly signals (e.g., warranties) to differentiate.\n- **Screening**: Buyers use mechanisms (e.g., warranties) to identify quality.\n\n#### **Equations:**\n1. **Expected Consumer Willingness to Pay (No Info)**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Expected Price} = 0.5 \\times P_{\\text{High}} + 0.5 \\times P_{\\text{Low}}\n   \\]\n   *(Given \\( P_{\\text{High}} = 9000 \\), \\( P_{\\text{Low}} = 6000 \\), Expected Price = \u20b97500)*\n\n2. **Profit with/without Warranty**:\n   - **Hamid (High Quality)**:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Profit}_{\\text{No Warranty}} = P_{\\text{No Info}} - C = 7500 - 7000 = \u20b9500\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     \\text{Profit}_{\\text{With Warranty}} = P_{\\text{High}} - C - \\text{Warranty Cost} = 9000 - 7000 - 500Y\n     \\]\n   - **Latif (Low Quality)**:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Profit}_{\\text{No Warranty}} = P_{\\text{No Info}} - C = 7500 - 4000 = \u20b93500\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     \\text{Profit}_{\\text{With Warranty}} = P_{\\text{Low}} - C - \\text{Warranty Cost} = 6000 - 4000 - 1000Y\n     \\]\n\n---\n\n### **3. International Trade & Tariffs**\n#### **Key Concepts:**\n- **Domestic Equilibrium**: \\( Q^d = Q^s \\)\n- **Free Trade**: Imports = \\( Q^d - Q^s \\) at world price.\n- **Tariff Effects**:\n  - **Consumer Surplus (CS)**: \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times Q \\times \\Delta P \\)\n  - **Producer Surplus (PS)**: \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times Q \\times \\Delta P \\)\n  - **Government Revenue**: \\( t \\times Q_{\\text{Import}} \\)\n  - **Deadweight Loss (DWL)**: \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times t \\times \\Delta Q \\)\n\n#### **Equations:**\n1. **Domestic Equilibrium Price**:\n   \\[\n   Q^d = Q^s \\implies 100 - P = P \\implies P^* = 50\n   \\]\n\n2. **Imports Without Tariff**:\n   \\[\n   Q^d_{\\text{World Price}} = 100 - 20 = 80\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   Q^s_{\\text{World Price}} = 20 \\implies \\text{Imports} = 80 - 20 = 60\n   \\]\n\n3. **Imports With Tariff (\\( t = 10 \\))**:\n   \\[\n   P_{\\text{New}} = 20 + 10 = 30\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   Q^d = 100 - 30 = 70, \\quad Q^s = 30 \\implies \\text{Imports} = 70 - 30 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Consumer/Producer Surplus**:\n   \\[\n   CS = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 80 \\times (100 - 20) = 3200 \\quad (\\text{Before Tariff})\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\Delta CS = \\frac{1}{2} \\times (80 + 70) \\times 10 = 750 \\quad (\\text{Loss due to Tariff})\n   \\]\n\n5. **Government Revenue**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Revenue} = 10 \\times 40 = 400\n   \\]\n\n---\n\n### **4. Tax Incidence & Market Efficiency**\n#### **Key Concepts:**\n- **Tax Burden**: Shared between consumers and producers based on elasticity.\n- **Deadweight Loss (DWL)**: Loss in total surplus due to tax.\n- **Consumer/Producer Surplus**: Area under demand/supply curves.\n\n#### **Equations (Pizza Market Example):**\n1. **Equilibrium Before Tax**:\n   \\[\n   Q^d = Q^s \\implies 300 - P = 60 + 2P \\implies P^* = 80, Q^* = 220\n   \\]\n\n2. **Equilibrium After Tax (\\( t = 15 \\))**:\n   \\[\n   Q^d = 300 - P_b, \\quad Q^s = 60 + 2(P_b - 15)\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   300 - P_b = 60 + 2P_b - 30 \\implies 3P_b = 330 \\implies P_b = 110\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   P_s = 110 - 15 = 95, \\quad Q = 190\n   \\]\n\n3. **Surplus Changes**:\n   - **Consumer Surplus (Before)**: \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times 220 \\times (300 - 80) = 24,200 \\)\n   - **Producer Surplus (Before)**: \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times 220 \\times (80 - 60) = 2,200 \\)\n   - **Tax Revenue**: \\( 15 \\times 190 = 2,850 \\)\n   - **DWL**: \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times 15 \\times (220 - 190) = 225 \\)\n\n---\n\n### **5. Externalities & Social Efficiency**\n#### **Key Concepts:**\n- **Positive Externality**: Benefit to a third party (e.g., beekeeping pollinates orchards).\n- **Socially Efficient Quantity**: Where \\( \\text{MSB} = \\text{MSC} \\).\n\n#### **Equations (Beekeeping Example):**\n1. **Private Optimum**:\n   \\[\n   MC = MB \\implies 10 + 5Q = 30 \\implies Q = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Social Optimum (Including Externality)**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{MSB} = 30 + 10 = 40 \\quad (\\text{\u20b910 saved per hive})\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{MSB} = \\text{MSC} \\implies 40 = 10 + 5Q \\implies Q = 6\n   \\]\n\n---\n\n### **6. Decision Making Under Uncertainty**\n#### **Key Concepts:**\n- **Expected Utility**: \\( E(U) = \\sum p_i \\times U(x_i) \\)\n- **Risk Aversion**: Preference for certain outcomes over risky ones.\n- **Opportunity Cost**: Cost of forgoing the next best alternative.\n\n#### **Equations (MBA Decision Example):**\n1. **Expected Value of MBA**:\n   \\[\n   EV_{\\text{MBA}} = p \\times 32 + 0.5 \\times 16 + (0.5 - p) \\times 12 - 10\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expected Value of No MBA**:\n   \\[\n   EV_{\\text{No MBA}} = p \\times 12 + 0.5 \\times 8 + (0.5 - p) \\times 4\n   \\]\n\n3. **Decision Rule**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Get MBA if } EV_{\\text{MBA}} > EV_{\\text{No MBA}}\n   \\]\n   *(For \\( p \\leq \\frac{1}{6} \\), do not get MBA.)*\n\n---\n\n### **7. Monopolistic Competition & Price Discrimination**\n#### **Key Concepts:**\n- **Monopolistic Competition**: Differentiated products, free entry/exit.\n- **Price Discrimination**:\n  - **1st Degree**: Charge each consumer their reservation price.\n  - **2nd Degree**: Quantity discounts.\n  - **3rd Degree**: Segment markets (e.g., student discounts).\n\n#### **Key Points:**\n- **First-Degree PD**: Extracts all consumer surplus (Pareto efficient).\n- **Third-Degree PD**: \\( \\frac{P_A - MC}{P_A} = \\frac{-1}{\\text{PED}_A} \\)\n\n---\n\n## **Mermaid Knowledge Graphs**\n### **1.
