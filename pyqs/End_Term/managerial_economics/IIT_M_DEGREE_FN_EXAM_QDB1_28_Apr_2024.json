        "summary": "Here\u2019s a structured **summary of core topics, concepts, principles, and equations** for the **Managerial Economics** exam, followed by **Mermaid knowledge graphs** to visualize relationships.\n\n---\n\n## **Core Topics & Key Concepts**\n### **1. Utility Theory & Risk Preferences**\n- **Utility Function**: \\( u(I) = (10I)^{0.5} \\) (where \\( I \\) = income in thousands).\n- **Expected Utility (EU)**:\n  \\[\n  EU = \\sum p_i \\cdot u(I_i)\n  \\]\n  - Compare EU of risky prospect vs. certain income to determine risk aversion/neutrality/loving.\n- **Risk Aversion**:\n  - If \\( u(I) \\) is concave (diminishing marginal utility), the individual is **risk-averse**.\n  - **Certainty Equivalent (CE)**: The certain income that gives the same utility as a risky prospect.\n  - **Risk Premium (RP)**: \\( \\text{RP} = \\text{Expected Income} - \\text{CE} \\).\n- **Insurance Willingness to Pay**:\n  - Maximum premium = **Risk Premium** (difference between expected income and CE).\n\n**Key Equations**:\n- For Nita\u2019s problem:\n  \\[\n  u(40) = \\sqrt{10 \\times 40} = \\sqrt{400} = 20\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  EU_{\\text{new job}} = 0.6 \\cdot \\sqrt{10 \\times 44} + 0.4 \\cdot \\sqrt{10 \\times 33} \\approx 0.6 \\times 20.98 + 0.4 \\times 18.17 \\approx 19.92\n  \\]\n  - Since \\( 19.92 < 20 \\), Nita is **risk-averse** and **should not take the job**.\n  - **Insurance Premium**: Solve \\( u(I - \\text{Premium}) = 19.92 \\).\n\n---\n\n### **2. Monopoly & Oligopoly**\n#### **A. Monopoly**\n- **Demand Curve**: \\( Q = 53 - P \\) \u2192 \\( P = 53 - Q \\).\n- **Total Revenue (TR)**: \\( TR = P \\cdot Q = (53 - Q)Q = 53Q - Q^2 \\).\n- **Marginal Revenue (MR)**: \\( MR = \\frac{d(TR)}{dQ} = 53 - 2Q \\).\n- **Profit Maximization**: Set \\( MR = MC \\).\n  - Given \\( MC = AC = 5 \\):\n    \\[\n    53 - 2Q = 5 \\implies Q^* = 24, \\quad P^* = 53 - 24 = 29\n    \\]\n- **Profit**: \\( \\pi = TR - TC = (29 \\times 24) - (5 \\times 24) = 576 \\).\n\n#### **B. Cournot Duopoly**\n- **Market Demand**: \\( Q_1 + Q_2 = 53 - P \\).\n- **Reaction Functions**:\n  - Firm 1\u2019s profit: \\( \\pi_1 = (53 - Q_1 - Q_2 - 5)Q_1 \\).\n  - Maximize \\( \\pi_1 \\): \\( \\frac{\\partial \\pi_1}{\\partial Q_1} = 48 - 2Q_1 - Q_2 = 0 \\).\n  - Symmetric equilibrium: \\( Q_1 = Q_2 = 16 \\).\n- **Equilibrium Price**: \\( P = 53 - (16 + 16) = 21 \\).\n- **Profits**: \\( \\pi_1 = \\pi_2 = (21 - 5) \\times 16 = 256 \\).\n\n#### **C. Stackelberg Duopoly**\n- **Leader (Firm 1)** moves first; **Follower (Firm 2)** responds.\n- **Firm 2\u2019s Reaction Function**: \\( Q_2 = \\frac{48 - Q_1}{2} \\).\n- **Firm 1\u2019s Profit**:\n  \\[\n  \\pi_1 = (53 - Q_1 - Q_2 - 5)Q_1 = (48 - Q_1 - \\frac{48 - Q_1}{2})Q_1\n  \\]\n  - Solve \\( \\frac{d\\pi_1}{dQ_1} = 0 \\): \\( Q_1^* = 24 \\), \\( Q_2^* = 12 \\).\n- **Price**: \\( P = 53 - (24 + 12) = 17 \\).\n- **Profits**: \\( \\pi_1 = 288 \\), \\( \\pi_2 = 144 \\).\n\n**Key Equations**:\n- Monopoly: \\( MR = MC \\), \\( \\pi = (P - AC)Q \\).\n- Cournot: Solve \\( \\frac{\\partial \\pi_i}{\\partial Q_i} = 0 \\) simultaneously.\n- Stackelberg: Substitute follower\u2019s reaction into leader\u2019s profit.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Cost Analysis**\n- **Accounting Cost**: Explicit costs (e.g., salaries, rent, expenses).\n  - Mohan\u2019s accounting cost = \u20b9400,000 (salary) + \u20b9250,000 (other expenses) = **\u20b9650,000**.\n- **Economic Cost**: Accounting cost + **Opportunity Cost** (foregone salary + rent).\n  - Mohan\u2019s economic cost = \u20b9650,000 + \u20b9500,000 (salary) + \u20b9240,000 (rent) = **\u20b91,390,000** (Note: Answer key says \u20b9990,000; likely excludes salary as it\u2019s already counted in accounting cost. Clarify with instructor.).\n- **Opportunity Cost**: Value of the next best alternative (e.g., Mohan\u2019s foregone salary and rent).\n\n---\n\n### **4. Tariffs & Trade**\n- **Demand Curve**: \\( Q = 2500 - 2P \\).\n- **Supply with Tariff**:\n  - **World Cost**: \u20b9100 (production) + \u20b925 (distribution) = \u20b9125.\n  - **Tariff**: \u20b925 \u2192 New cost = \u20b9150.\n- **Equilibrium without Tariff**:\n  - \\( P = MC = 125 \\), \\( Q = 2500 - 2(125) = 2250 \\).\n- **Equilibrium with Tariff**:\n  - \\( P = 150 \\), \\( Q = 2500 - 2(150) = 2200 \\).\n- **Consumer Surplus (CS) Loss**:\n  - \\( \\Delta CS = \\frac{1}{2} \\times (2250 - 2200) \\times (150 - 125) = 6,250 \\) (Note: Answer key says \u20b955,625; likely calculates total CS change, not just the triangular loss. Use integral for precise CS.).\n- **Tax Revenue**: \\( \\text{Tariff} \\times Q = 25 \\times 2200 = 55,000 \\).\n- **Deadweight Loss (DWL)**:\n  - \\( DWL = \\frac{1}{2} \\times (2250 - 2200) \\times 25 = 625 \\).\n  - **Net Loss**: DWL is always a loss; no gain offsets it.\n\n**Key Equations**:\n- CS: \\( \\int_{Q_1}^{Q_2} P(Q) \\, dQ \\).\n- Tax Revenue: \\( t \\times Q_{\\text{new}} \\).\n- DWL: \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\Delta Q \\times t \\).\n\n---\n\n### **5. Asymmetric Information**\n#### **A. Adverse Selection**\n- **Problem**: High-risk individuals (e.g., bad drivers) are more likely to buy insurance.\n- **Solution**: Screening (e.g., driving records) or signaling (e.g., warranties).\n- **Example**: Latif\u2019s Motors sells low-quality cars; consumers cannot distinguish quality \u2192 **market for lemons**.\n\n#### **B. Moral Hazard**\n- **Problem**: Insured individuals take more risks (e.g., reckless driving).\n- **Solution**: Monitor behavior or align incentives (e.g., deductibles).\n\n#### **C. Signaling & Warranties**\n- **Hamid\u2019s Cars**: High-quality, warranty cost = \u20b9500Y.\n- **Latif\u2019s Motors**: Low-quality, warranty cost = \u20b91000Y.\n- **Equilibrium**:\n  - If Hamid offers a warranty, Latif **cannot profitably mimic** (higher warranty cost).\n  - **Separating Equilibrium**: Hamid signals quality with warranty; Latif does not.\n\n**Key Takeaways**:\n- Adverse selection \u2192 **hidden information**.\n- Moral hazard \u2192 **hidden action**.\n- Signaling \u2192 **credible communication of quality**.\n\n---\n\n### **6.
