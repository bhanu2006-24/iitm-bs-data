        "summary": "Here\u2019s a structured **summary of core topics, concepts, principles, and equations** for the **Managerial Economics** exam, followed by **Mermaid knowledge graphs** to visualize relationships.\n\n---\n\n## **Core Topics & Key Concepts**\n### **1. Market Structures**\n#### **A. Monopolistic Competition**\n- **Definition**: Many firms selling **differentiated products** (highly but not perfectly substitutable).\n- **Key Features**:\n  - Free entry/exit (no barriers).\n  - Firms have **some price-setting power** (downward-sloping demand curve).\n  - **Zero economic profit in long run** (due to free entry).\n- **Contrast with Monopoly/Oligopoly**:\n  - Monopoly: Single seller, high barriers.\n  - Oligopoly: Few sellers, interdependence.\n\n#### **B. Monopoly**\n- **Profit Maximization**:\n  - **Condition**: \\( MR = MC \\).\n  - **Demand Curve**: Monopolist operates in the **elastic region** (to maximize revenue).\n  - **Lerner Index**: Measures monopoly power:\n    \\[\n    L = \\frac{P - MC}{P}\n    \\]\n- **First-Degree Price Discrimination**:\n  - Charging each consumer their **reservation price** (max willingness to pay).\n- **Third-Degree Price Discrimination**:\n  - Charging different prices to **different consumer groups** (e.g., students vs. adults).\n\n#### **C. Common Resources**\n- **Definition**: Goods that are **rivalrous** (consumption by one reduces availability) but **non-excludable** (hard to prevent access).\n- **Examples**: Fish stocks, groundwater.\n- **Tragedy of the Commons**: Overuse due to lack of property rights.\n\n---\n### **2. Production & Cost Theory**\n#### **A. Production Functions**\n- **Linear Production Function**:\n  - \\( Q = aL + bK \\) (constant trade-off between inputs).\n  - Example: 3 units of labor = 1 unit of capital (from Q3).\n- **Cobb-Douglas**: \\( Q = AL^\\alpha K^\\beta \\) (not relevant here).\n- **Leontief**: Fixed input ratios (not applicable in Q3).\n\n#### **B. Cost Curves**\n- **Marginal Cost (MC)**: Cost of producing one more unit.\n- **Average Cost (AC)**: Total cost divided by quantity.\n- **Relationship**: \\( MC \\) intersects \\( AC \\) at its minimum.\n\n---\n### **3. Game Theory & Asymmetric Information**\n#### **A. Adverse Selection**\n- **Definition**: Market failure due to **hidden information** (e.g., high-risk individuals more likely to buy insurance).\n- **Example**: Risky drivers buying life insurance (Q7).\n\n#### **B. Screening vs. Signaling**\n- **Screening**: Action by the **uninformed party** (e.g., insurance companies checking driving records).\n- **Signaling**: Action by the **informed party** (e.g., education signaling productivity).\n- **Q8 Insight**: If bad drivers avoid tickets, insurers **cannot screen** effectively.\n\n---\n### **4. Consumer & Producer Surplus**\n#### **A. Consumer Surplus (CS)**\n- **Definition**: Difference between what consumers **are willing to pay** and what they **actually pay**.\n- **Formula**:\n  \\[\n  CS = \\frac{1}{2} \\times (P_{\\text{max}} - P_{\\text{market}}) \\times Q\n  \\]\n- **Example**: From Q9\u2013Q11 (monopoly case).\n\n#### **B. Producer Surplus (PS)**\n- **Definition**: Difference between what producers **receive** and their **cost**.\n- **Formula**:\n  \\[\n  PS = \\frac{1}{2} \\times (P_{\\text{market}} - MC) \\times Q\n  \\]\n\n#### **C. Deadweight Loss (DWL)**\n- **Definition**: Loss in economic efficiency due to market distortions (e.g., monopoly, tariffs).\n- **Formula**:\n  \\[\n  DWL = \\frac{1}{2} \\times (P - MC) \\times (Q_{\\text{competitive}} - Q_{\\text{monopoly}})\n  \\]\n\n---\n### **5. Risk Preferences & Utility**\n#### **A. Risk Aversion**\n- **Definition**: Preference for **certainty** over gambles with equal expected value.\n- **Utility Function**: \\( u(I) = \\sqrt{10I} \\) (from Q12\u2013Q14).\n- **Expected Utility (EU)**:\n  \\[\n  EU = \\sum p_i \\times u(I_i)\n  \\]\n- **Certainty Equivalent (CE)**: Amount of certain income that gives the same utility as a gamble.\n- **Risk Premium**: \\( CE - \\text{Expected Value} \\).\n\n#### **B. Insurance**\n- **Willingness to Pay**: Difference between **expected utility** and **utility of certain income**.\n- **Example**: Nita\u2019s insurance premium (Q14).\n\n---\n### **6. Tariffs & International Trade**\n#### **A. Tariff Effects**\n- **Consumer Price**: Increases by tariff amount (if small country) or less (if large country).\n- **Quantity Demanded**: Falls due to higher price.\n- **Consumer Surplus Loss**: Area between old and new price on demand curve.\n- **Government Revenue**: Tariff \u00d7 New quantity.\n- **Deadweight Loss**: Net loss to society (from Q15\u2013Q20).\n\n#### **B. Key Equations (Palm Oil Example)**\n- **Demand**: \\( Q = 2500 - 2P \\).\n- **Supply (with tariff)**: \\( P = MC + \\text{Tariff} = 125 + 25 = 150 \\).\n- **New Quantity**: \\( Q = 2500 - 2(150) = 2200 \\).\n\n---\n### **7. Externalities & Market Failure**\n#### **A. Negative Externalities**\n- **Definition**: Costs borne by **third parties** (e.g., pollution).\n- **Marginal External Cost (MEC)**: Additional cost to society per unit.\n- **Socially Efficient Output**: Where \\( P = MC + MEC \\).\n\n#### **B. Pigovian Tax**\n- **Purpose**: Internalize the externality.\n- **Tax Amount**: Equal to \\( MEC \\) at efficient output (from Q21\u2013Q25).\n\n---\n### **8. Monopoly vs. Competition**\n#### **A. Competitive Market**\n- **Output**: \\( P = MC \\).\n- **Example (Dry Cleaning)**:\n  - Demand: \\( P = 100 - Q \\).\n  - \\( MC = 10 + Q \\).\n  - Equilibrium: \\( 100 - Q = 10 + Q \\Rightarrow Q = 45 \\).\n\n#### **B. Monopoly**\n- **Output**: \\( MR = MC \\).\n- **Example (Dry Cleaning)**:\n  - \\( TR = P \\times Q = (100 - Q)Q \\).\n  - \\( MR = 100 - 2Q \\).\n  - Set \\( MR = MC \\): \\( 100 - 2Q = 10 + Q \\Rightarrow Q = 30 \\).\n\n---\n### **9. Price Discrimination (Airlines)**\n#### **A. Third-Degree Price Discrimination**\n- **Segments**: Business (less elastic) vs. Students (more elastic).\n- **Pricing Rule**:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{P_A - MC}{P_A} = \\frac{1}{|\\epsilon_A|}, \\quad \\frac{P_B - MC}{P_B} = \\frac{1}{|\\epsilon_B|}\n  \\]\n- **Example (BA Airlines)**:\n  - Business demand: \\( Q_A = 260 - 0.4P \\).\n  - Student demand: \\( Q_B = 240 - 0.6P \\).\n  - \\( MC = 100 \\).\n\n---\n## **Key Equations Summary**\n| **Concept**               | **Equation**                                                                 |\n|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Profit Maximization**   | \\( MR = MC \\)                                                               |\n| **Monopoly Revenue**      | \\( TR = P \\times Q \\), \\( MR = \\frac{d(TR)}{dQ} \\)                         |\n| **Lerner Index**          | \\( L = \\frac{P - MC}{P} \\)                                                  |\n| **Consumer Surplus**      | \\( CS = \\frac{1}{2} \\times (P_{\\text{max}} - P) \\times Q \\)               |\n| **Producer Surplus**      | \\( PS = \\frac{1}{2} \\times (P - MC) \\times Q \\)                            |\n| **Deadweight Loss**       | \\( DWL = \\frac{1}{2} \\times (P - MC) \\times \\Delta Q \\)                    |\n| **Expected Utility**      | \\( EU = \\sum p_i \\times u(I_i) \\)                                           |\n| **Risk Premium**          | \\( RP = \\text{Expected Value} - \\text{Certainty Equivalent} \\)             |\n| **Tariff Impact**         | \\( P_{\\text{new}} = P_{\\text{world}} + \\text{Tariff} \\)                   |\n| **Social Cost**           | \\( SC = MC + MEC \\)                                                         |\n| **Pigovian Tax**          | \\( t = MEC \\)                                                               |\n| **Price Discrimination**  | \\( \\frac{P - MC}{P} = \\frac{1}{|\\epsilon|} \\)                              |\n\n---\n\n## **Mermaid Knowledge Graphs**\n### **1.
