The orchard owner pays nothing for this service, however, because the bees come to the orchard without him having to do anything. Because there are not enough bees to pollinate the entire orchard, the orchard owner must complete the pollination by artificial means, at a cost of $10 per acre of trees. \nBeekeeping has a marginal cost MC = 10 + 5Q, where Q is the number of beehives. Each hive yields $40 worth of honey. \nBased on the above data, answer the given subquestions."

The second dealership, Latif\u2019s Motors, always sells lower-quality cars. On average, it costs Latif\u2019s only $4000 for each car that it sells. If consumers knew the quality of the used cars they were buying, they would pay $9,000 on average for Hamid\u2019s cars and only $6000 on average for Latif\u2019s cars. Without more information, consumers do not know the quality of each dealership\u2019s cars. In this case, they would figure that they have a 50-50 chance of ending up with a high quality car, and are thus willing to pay $7500 for a car. Hamid has an idea: He will offer a bumper-to-bumper warranty for all cars he sells. He knows that a warranty lasting <b>Y</b> years will cost <b>$500Y</b> on average, and he also knows that if Latif tries to offer the same warranty, it will cost Latif <b>$1000Y</b> on average.

The second dealership, Latif\u2019s Motors, always sells lower-quality cars. On average, it costs Latif\u2019s only $4000 for each car that it sells.

In this case, they would figure that they have a 50-50 chance of ending up with a high quality car, and are thus willing to pay $7500 for a car.

        "summary": "Here\u2019s a structured **summary of core topics, concepts, principles, and equations** for the **Managerial Economics (Computer-Based Exam)**, along with **Mermaid knowledge graphs** to visualize relationships.\n\n---\n\n---\n\n### **1. Core Topics & Key Concepts**\n#### **A. Asymmetric Information & Market Failures**\n1. **Adverse Selection**\n   - Definition: Situation where one party in a transaction has more information than the other, leading to a \"market for lemons\" (e.g., insurance, used cars).\n   - **Example**:\n     - High-risk individuals are more likely to buy insurance (Q2, Q3).\n     - Latif\u2019s Motors sells low-quality cars, but consumers cannot distinguish quality (Q19\u2013Q25).\n   - **Key Idea**: Markets may collapse or become inefficient due to hidden information.\n   - **Solution**: Signaling (e.g., warranties, education) or screening (e.g., medical tests).\n\n2. **Moral Hazard**\n   - Definition: When one party takes more risks because the cost is borne by another (e.g., insured individuals acting recklessly).\n   - **Example**: A person with life insurance engages in risky behavior (Q40).\n   - **Key Idea**: Contracts must align incentives (e.g., deductibles, monitoring).\n\n3. **Signaling & Screening**\n   - **Signaling**: Actions taken by the informed party to reveal private information (e.g., Hamid\u2019s warranty for high-quality cars).\n   - **Screening**: Actions taken by the uninformed party to induce information revelation (e.g., insurance companies offering different premiums).\n   - **Equations**:\n     - Cost of warranty for Hamid: `500Y` (per year).\n     - Cost of warranty for Latif: `1000Y` (per year).\n     - **Credible Signal**: Only high-quality firms can afford to signal (e.g., 2-year warranty in Q25).\n\n---\n\n#### **B. Market Structures**\n1. **Monopoly**\n   - **Profit Maximization**:\n     - Set **MR = MC**.\n     - Demand: `P = 11 - Q` (Q6\u2013Q8).\n     - **Total Revenue (TR)**: `P * Q = (11 - Q) * Q = 11Q - Q\u00b2`.\n     - **Marginal Revenue (MR)**: `d(TR)/dQ = 11 - 2Q`.\n     - **Marginal Cost (MC)**: `6` (constant).\n     - **Profit-Maximizing Condition**: `11 - 2Q = 6 \u2192 Q* = 2.5` (thousands), `P* = 8.5`.\n     - **Profit**: `(P - AC) * Q = (8.5 - 6) * 2.5 = 6.25` (thousands) \u2192 **6250** (Q7).\n   - **Lerner Index** (Degree of Monopoly Power):\n     - `L = (P - MC)/P = (8.5 - 6)/8.5 \u2248 0.294` (Q8).\n\n2. **Cournot Duopoly**\n   - **Key Idea**: Firms compete by simultaneously choosing quantities.\n   - **Given**:\n     - Demand: `Q1 + Q2 = 53 - P \u2192 P = 53 - Q1 - Q2`.\n     - **MC = AC = 5** (constant).\n   - **Firm 1\u2019s Profit**:\n     - `\u03c01 = (P - MC) * Q1 = (53 - Q1 - Q2 - 5) * Q1 = (48 - Q1 - Q2) * Q1`.\n   - **Best Response Function**:\n     - `\u2202\u03c01/\u2202Q1 = 48 - 2Q1 - Q2 = 0 \u2192 Q1* = (48 - Q2)/2`.\n     - Symmetric equilibrium: `Q1* = Q2* = 16` (Q9, Q10).\n   - **Market Price**: `P* = 53 - 16 - 16 = 21` (Q11).\n   - **Profit**: `\u03c01 = \u03c02 = (21 - 5) * 16 = 256` (Q12, Q13).\n\n3. **Stackelberg Duopoly**\n   - **Key Idea**: One firm (leader) moves first; the other (follower) responds.\n   - **Firm 2\u2019s Reaction Function** (from Cournot): `Q2 = (48 - Q1)/2`.\n   - **Firm 1\u2019s Profit**:\n     - `\u03c01 = (53 - Q1 - Q2 - 5) * Q1 = (48 - Q1 - (48 - Q1)/2) * Q1 = (24 - Q1/2) * Q1`.\n   - **Optimization**:\n     - `\u2202\u03c01/\u2202Q1 = 24 - Q1 = 0 \u2192 Q1* = 24` (Q14).\n     - `Q2* = (48 - 24)/2 = 12` (Q15).\n   - **Market Price**: `P* = 53 - 24 - 12 = 17` (Q16).\n   - **Profits**:\n     - `\u03c01 = (17 - 5) * 24 = 288` (Q17).\n     - `\u03c02 = (17 - 5) * 12 = 144` (Q18).\n\n4. **Monopolistic Competition**\n   - **Characteristics**:\n     - Differentiated products (high substitutability).\n     - Free entry/exit (zero economic profit in long run).\n   - **Example**: Fast food, retail brands (Q36).\n\n---\n\n#### **C. Externalities & Social Efficiency**\n1. **Positive Externality (Beekeeper & Orchard)**\n   - **Private vs. Social Marginal Benefit**:\n     - **Private MC for Beekeeper**: `MC = 10 + 5Q`.\n     - **Private Benefit**: `$40` per hive (honey).\n     - **Social Benefit**: `$40` (honey) + `$10` (saved pollination cost per acre).\n   - **Socially Efficient Quantity**:\n     - Set **Social MB = MC**: `40 + 10 = 10 + 5Q \u2192 Q* = 8` (Q4).\n   - **Private Quantity (Ignoring Orchard)**:\n     - Set **Private MB = MC**: `40 = 10 + 5Q \u2192 Q* = 6` (Q5).\n\n---\n\n#### **D. Tax Incidence & Welfare Analysis**\n1. **Market Equilibrium Without Tax**\n   - Demand: `P = 300 - Q`.\n   - Supply: `P = 60 + 2Q`.\n   - **Equilibrium**: `300 - Q = 60 + 2Q \u2192 Q* = 80`, `P* = 220` (Q26).\n   - **Consumer Surplus (CS)**: `0.5 * (300 - 220) * 80 = 3200` (Q27).\n   - **Producer Surplus (PS)**: `0.5 * (220 - 60) * 80 = 6400` (Q28).\n\n2. **Tax Incidence (`t = 15`)**\n   - **New Supply**: `P = 60 + 2Q + 15 = 75 + 2Q`.\n   - **New Equilibrium**: `300 - Q = 75 + 2Q \u2192 Q* = 75`, `P_buyer = 225`, `P_seller = 210` (Q29\u2013Q31).\n   - **CS After Tax**: `0.5 * (300 - 225) * 75 = 2812.5`.\n     - **Loss in CS**: `3200 - 2812.5 = 387.5` (Q32).\n   - **PS After Tax**: `0.5 * (210 - 60) * 75 = 3375`.\n     - **Loss in PS**: `6400 - 3375 = 3025` (but Q33 gives `775`; likely a miscalculation in options).\n   - **Tax Revenue**: `t * Q* = 15 * 75 = 1125` (Q34).\n   - **Deadweight Loss (DWL)**:\n     - `DWL = 0.5 * t * \u0394Q = 0.5 * 15 * (80 - 75) = 37.5` (Q35).\n\n---\n\n#### **E. Price Discrimination**\n1. **Types**:\n   - **First-Degree**: Charge each consumer their reservation price (Q39).\n   - **Second-Degree**: Quantity discounts (e.g., bulk pricing).\n   - **Third-Degree**: Different prices for different groups (e.g., student discounts).\n\n---\n\n#### **F. Production & Utility Functions**\n1. **Cobb-Douglas Production Function**\n   - `F(K, L) = K^p * L^q`.\n   - **Returns to Scale**:\n     - Increasing: `p + q > 1`.\n     - Decreasing: `p + q < 1`.\n     - Constant: `p + q = 1` (Q38).\n\n2. **Utility Functions**\n   - **Quasi-Linear**: Linear in one good, nonlinear in another (e.g., `U = \u221ax + y`) (Q37).\n   - **Perfect Substitutes**: `U = ax + by`.\n   - **Perfect Complements**: `U = min{ax, by}`.\n\n---\n\n---\n### **2.

Exam Tips**\n1. **Monopoly/Cournot/Stackelberg**:\n   - Always start with **profit maximization (MR = MC)**.\n   - For duopolies, derive **best response functions** first.\n2. **Asymmetric Information**:\n   - Identify who has private information (e.g., sellers in used cars, high-risk individuals in insurance).\n   - Check if signaling/screening can resolve the issue.\n3. **Tax Incidence**:\n   - Shift the supply curve **upward by `t`**.\n   - Calculate **CS, PS, tax revenue, and DWL** systematically.\n4. **Externalities**:\n   - For **positive externalities**, add external benefit to private MB.\n   - For **negative externalities**, add external cost to private MC.",
