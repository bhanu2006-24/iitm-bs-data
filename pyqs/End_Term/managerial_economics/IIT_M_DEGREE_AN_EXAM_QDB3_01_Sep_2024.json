        "summary": "Here\u2019s a structured **summary of core topics, concepts, principles, and equations** for the **Managerial Economics** exam, followed by **Mermaid knowledge graphs** to visualize relationships.\n\n---\n\n## **Core Topics & Key Concepts**\n### **1. Market Structures**\n#### **A. Monopolistic Competition**\n- **Definition**: Many firms selling **differentiated products** (highly but not perfectly substitutable).\n- **Key Features**:\n  - Free entry/exit (no barriers).\n  - Firms have **some price-setting power** (downward-sloping demand curve).\n  - **Zero economic profit in long run** (tangency of demand and average cost curves).\n- **Contrast with Monopoly/Oligopoly**:\n  - Monopoly: Single seller, high barriers.\n  - Oligopoly: Few firms, strategic interdependence.\n\n#### **B. Monopoly**\n- **Profit Maximization**:\n  - **Condition**: \\( MR = MC \\).\n  - **Demand Curve**: \\( P = 11 - Q \\) (from Q9).\n  - **Total Revenue (TR)**: \\( TR = P \\times Q = (11 - Q)Q = 11Q - Q^2 \\).\n  - **Marginal Revenue (MR)**: \\( MR = \\frac{d(TR)}{dQ} = 11 - 2Q \\).\n  - **Marginal Cost (MC)**: \\( MC = AC = 6 \\) (constant).\n  - **Profit-Maximizing Quantity**: Solve \\( MR = MC \\):\n    \\[\n    11 - 2Q = 6 \\implies Q = 2.5 \\text{ (thousand units)}\n    \\]\n  - **Profit-Maximizing Price**: Plug \\( Q \\) into demand:\n    \\[\n    P = 11 - 2.5 = 8.5\n    \\]\n  - **Profit**: \\( \\pi = (P - AC) \\times Q = (8.5 - 6) \\times 2.5 = 6.25 \\) (thousand $).\n- **Lerner Index** (Degree of Monopoly Power):\n  \\[\n  L = \\frac{P - MC}{P} = \\frac{8.5 - 6}{8.5} \\approx 0.294\n  \\]\n- **Consumer/Producer Surplus & Deadweight Loss**:\n  - **Consumer Surplus (CS)**: Area under demand curve above price.\n  - **Producer Surplus (PS)**: Area above MC below price.\n  - **Deadweight Loss (DWL)**: Loss from monopoly pricing vs. competitive equilibrium.\n\n#### **C. Price Discrimination**\n- **Types**:\n  1. **First-Degree**: Charge each consumer their **reservation price** (max willingness to pay).\n  2. **Second-Degree**: Quantity discounts (e.g., bulk pricing).\n  3. **Third-Degree**: Segment markets (e.g., student vs. business class).\n- **Example (Q5)**: First-degree discrimination involves per-unit pricing at reservation price.\n\n#### **D. Common Resources**\n- **Definition**: **Rival but non-excludable** (e.g., fish stocks, groundwater).\n- **Tragedy of the Commons**: Overuse due to lack of property rights.\n- **Contrast**:\n  - **Private Goods**: Rival & excludable.\n  - **Public Goods**: Non-rival & non-excludable.\n\n---\n### **2. Production & Cost Theory**\n#### **A. Production Functions**\n- **Linear Production Function**:\n  - \\( Q = aL + bK \\) (constant trade-off between inputs).\n  - **Example (Q3)**: 3 units of labor = 1 unit of capital \u2192 Linear.\n- **Cobb-Douglas**: \\( Q = AL^\\alpha K^\\beta \\) (substitutable inputs).\n- **Leontief**: Fixed-proportion inputs (no substitutability).\n\n#### **B. Cost Curves**\n- **Marginal Cost (MC)**: Cost of producing one more unit.\n- **Average Cost (AC)**: Total cost per unit.\n- **Relationship**: MC intersects AC at its minimum.\n\n---\n### **3. Asymmetric Information**\n#### **A. Adverse Selection**\n- **Definition**: High-risk individuals more likely to participate (e.g., risky drivers buying insurance).\n- **Example (Q7)**: A person with a risky lifestyle buys life insurance.\n- **Solutions**: Screening (e.g., medical tests), signaling (e.g., education).\n\n#### **B. Moral Hazard**\n- **Definition**: Change in behavior after entering a contract (e.g., reckless driving with insurance).\n- **Example (Q8)**: If bad drivers avoid tickets, insurers **cannot screen** using driving records.\n\n---\n### **4. Risk Preferences & Utility**\n#### **A. Utility Function**\n- **Example (Q12-14)**: \\( u(I) = (10I)^{0.5} \\).\n- **Expected Utility (EU)**:\n  \\[\n  EU = \\sum p_i \\cdot u(I_i)\n  \\]\n- **Risk Aversion**:\n  - **Risk-Averse**: \\( u''(I) < 0 \\) (diminishing marginal utility).\n  - **Risk-Loving**: \\( u''(I) > 0 \\).\n  - **Risk-Neutral**: \\( u''(I) = 0 \\).\n\n#### **B. Insurance & Certainty Equivalent**\n- **Certainty Equivalent (CE)**: Income with same utility as a risky prospect.\n- **Willingness to Pay for Insurance**: Difference between expected income and CE.\n\n---\n### **5. Tariffs & Trade**\n#### **A. Tariff Effects (Q15-20)**\n- **Demand Curve**: \\( Q = 2500 - 2P \\).\n- **World Price**: \\( MC = 100 \\) (production) + \\( 25 \\) (distribution) = **125 INR/litre**.\n- **No Tariff**:\n  - Quantity: \\( Q = 2500 - 2(125) = 2250 \\) thousand litres.\n- **With Tariff (25 INR)**:\n  - New price: \\( 125 + 25 = 150 \\) INR.\n  - New quantity: \\( Q = 2500 - 2(150) = 2200 \\).\n- **Welfare Effects**:\n  - **Consumer Surplus Loss**: Area between demand curve and new price.\n  - **Government Revenue**: Tariff \u00d7 New quantity = \\( 25 \\times 2200 = 55,000 \\) thousand INR.\n  - **Deadweight Loss**: Net loss to society (triangular area).\n\n---\n### **6. Externalities & Market Failure**\n#### **A. Negative Externalities (Q21-25)**\n- **Example**: Dry cleaning pollution.\n- **Private MC**: \\( MC = 10 + Q \\).\n- **Social MC**: \\( MC_{social} = MC + MEC = 10 + Q + Q = 10 + 2Q \\).\n- **Competitive Equilibrium (No Regulation)**:\n  - Set \\( P = MC \\):\n    \\[\n    100 - Q = 10 + Q \\implies Q = 45, P = 55\n    \\]\n- **Socially Efficient Output**:\n  - Set \\( P = MC_{social} \\):\n    \\[\n    100 - Q = 10 + 2Q \\implies Q = 30, P = 70\n    \\]\n- **Pigovian Tax**: Tax = MEC at efficient output = **1 INR/unit**.\n\n#### **B. Monopoly with Externalities (Q26-27)**\n- **Monopoly Output**: Set \\( MR = MC \\).\n  - \\( MR = 100 - 2Q \\), \\( MC = 10 + Q \\).\n  - \\( 100 - 2Q = 10 + Q \\implies Q = 30 \\), \\( P = 70 \\).\n\n---\n### **7. Game Theory & Pricing Strategies**\n#### **A. Price Discrimination (Q28-37)**\n- **Bharat Airlines (BA) Example**:\n  - **Demand**: \\( Q = 500 - P \\).\n  - **Cost**: Fixed = 30,000, Variable = 100/passenger.\n  - **Profit Maximization**:\n    - \\( TR = P \\times Q = P(500 - P) \\).\n    - \\( MR = 500 - 2P \\).\n    - Set \\( MR = MC \\):\n      \\[\n      500 - 2P = 100 \\implies P = 200, Q = 300\n      \\]\n    - **Profit**: \\( TR - TC = 200 \\times 300 - (30,000 + 100 \\times 300) = 10,000 \\).\n  - **Third-Degree Discrimination**:\n    - **Business (Type A)**: \\( Q_A = 260 - 0.4P_A \\).\n    - **Students (Type B)**: \\( Q_B = 240 - 0.6P_B \\).\n    - **Optimal Prices**: Set \\( MR_A = MR_B = MC \\).\n\n---\n## **Key Equations**\n| **Concept**               | **Equation**                                                                 |\n|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Profit Maximization**   | \\( MR = MC \\)                                                               |\n| **Monopoly Revenue**      | \\( TR = P \\times Q \\), \\( MR = \\frac{d(TR)}{dQ} \\)                         |\n| **Lerner Index**          | \\( L = \\frac{P - MC}{P} \\)                                                  |\n| **Consumer Surplus**      | \\( CS = \\int_{0}^{Q} P(Q) \\, dQ - P \\times Q \\)                           |\n| **Producer Surplus**      | \\( PS = P \\times Q - \\int_{0}^{Q} MC(Q) \\, dQ \\)                           |\n| **Deadweight Loss**       | Triangular area between monopoly and competitive output.                  |\n| **Expected Utility**      | \\( EU = \\sum p_i u(I_i) \\)                                                  |\n| **Certainty Equivalent**  | \\( u(CE) = EU \\)                                                            |\n| **Tariff Revenue**        | \\( \\text{Tariff} \\times \\text{New Quantity} \\)                             |\n| **Social MC**             | \\( MC_{private} + MEC \\)                                                    |\n| **Pigovian Tax**          | \\( t = MEC \\) at efficient output.                                         |\n| **Third-Degree Price Discrimination** | \\( MR_i = MC \\) for each segment \\( i \\).          |\n\n---\n\n## **Mermaid Knowledge Graphs**\n### **1.
