                            "Imagine that you have been working after college and now face the decision of whether or not to get an MBA at a prestigious institution. The cost of getting the MBA is 10. (Again, you can decide on the denomination, but rest assured that this sum includes the income lost over the course of the two years you will be studying!) Your future value is your stream of income, which depends on the strength of the labor market for the next decade. If the labor market is strong then your income value from having an MBA is 32, while your income value from your current status is 12. If the labor market is average then your income value from having an MBA is 16, while your income value from your current status is 8. If the labor market is weak then your income value from having an MBA is 12, while your income value from your current status is 4. Further assume that the probability of a strong labor market is p, of an average labor market is 0.5 and of a weak labor market is 0.5\u2212 p. \nBased on the above data, answer the given subquestions.

Monopoly & Pricing Strategies**\n### **Key Concepts**\n- **Profit Maximization**: \\( MR = MC \\)\n- **Price Elasticity of Demand (PED)**:\n  - \\( PED = \\frac{\\% \\Delta Q_d}{\\% \\Delta P} \\)\n  - For monopolists: \\( MR = P \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{PED}\\right) \\)\n- **Markup Pricing**:\n  - \\( P = MC \\left(\\frac{PED}{1 + PED}\\right) \\)\n  - % Markup = \\( \\frac{P - MC}{P} \\times 100 \\)\n- **Profit Calculation**:\n  - \\( \\text{Profit} = (P - ATC) \\times Q - FC \\)\n\n### **Equations**\n| Equation | Description |\n|----------|-------------|\n| \\( MR = P \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{PED}\\right) \\) | Marginal Revenue with Elasticity |\n| \\( P = \\frac{MC \\times PED}{1 + PED} \\) | Optimal Price (Monopoly) |\n| \\( \\text{Profit} = TR - TC \\) | Total Profit |\n| \\( ATC = \\frac{TC}{Q} \\) | Average Total Cost |\n\n### **Example (Q2-Q4)**\n- Given:\n  - \\( P = 40 \\), \\( Q = 800 \\), \\( PED = -2 \\), \\( ATC = 15 \\), \\( FC = 2000 \\)\n- **Find MC**:\n  - \\( MR = MC \\), \\( MR = 40 \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{-2}\\right) = 20 \\)\n  - **Answer**: \\( MC = 20 \\)\n- **Markup**:\n  - \\( \\frac{40 - 20}{40} \\times 100 = 50\\% \\)\n- **Profit**:\n  - \\( TR = 40 \\times 800 = 32,000 \\)\n  - \\( TC = (15 \\times 800) + 2000 = 14,000 \\)\n  - \\( \\text{Profit} = 32,000 - 14,000 = 18,000 \\) *(Note: Answer key says 20,000; possible typo in FC or ATC.)*\n\n---\n\n## **2. Game Theory & Strategic Behavior**\n### **Key Concepts**\n- **Signaling**: Using observable actions (e.g., warranties) to convey hidden information.\n- **Adverse Selection**: High-risk individuals are more likely to participate (e.g., insurance).\n- **Moral Hazard**: Agents take more risks after entering a contract.\n- **Nash Equilibrium**: No player can benefit by unilaterally changing strategy.\n\n### **Example (Q5-Q11: Hamid & Latif\u2019s Cars)**\n| Scenario | Hamid (High Quality) | Latif (Low Quality) |\n|----------|----------------------|---------------------|\n| **Cost per Car** | $7,000 | $4,000 |\n| **Willingness to Pay (Informed)** | $9,000 | $6,000 |\n| **Willingness to Pay (Uninformed)** | $7,500 (50-50 chance) |\n| **Warranty Cost (Y years)** | $500Y | $1,000Y |\n\n#### **Key Calculations**\n1. **Without Warranty**:\n   - Latif\u2019s profit: \\( 7,500 - 4,000 = 3,500 \\)\n   - Hamid\u2019s profit: \\( 7,500 - 7,000 = 500 \\)\n2. **With 1-Year Warranty**:\n   - Hamid\u2019s cost: \\( 7,000 + 500 = 7,500 \\)\n     - If Latif doesn\u2019t offer warranty: Consumers pay $9,000 (full info).\n     - Profit: \\( 9,000 - 7,500 = 1,500 \\)\n   - Latif\u2019s cost: \\( 4,000 + 1,000 = 5,000 \\)\n     - If Latif offers warranty: Consumers pay $6,000.\n     - Profit: \\( 6,000 - 5,000 = 1,000 \\)\n3. **With 2-Year Warranty**:\n   - Hamid\u2019s cost: \\( 7,000 + 1,000 = 8,000 \\)\n     - Consumers pay $9,000 \u2192 Profit = $1,000\n   - Latif\u2019s cost: \\( 4,000 + 2,000 = 6,000 \\)\n     - Consumers pay $6,000 \u2192 Profit = $0\n   - **Credible Signal**: Latif won\u2019t mimic (loses money).\n\n---\n\n## **3.

Externalities & Social Efficiency**\n### **Key Concepts**\n- **Private vs. Social Cost**:\n  - \\( MSC = MPC + \\text{External Cost} \\)\n- **Optimal Quantity**: Where \\( MSC = MSB \\)\n\n### **Example (Q30-Q31: Beekeeper & Orchard)**\n- **Marginal Cost**: \\( MC = 10 + 5Q \\)\n- **Marginal Benefit (Honey)**: \\( MB_{\\text{honey}} = 30 \\)\n- **Marginal Benefit (Pollination)**: \\( MB_{\\text{pollination}} = 10 \\) (saves orchard $10/acre)\n- **Socially Efficient Q**:\n  - \\( MSC = MC \\), \\( MSB = MB_{\\text{honey}} + MB_{\\text{pollination}} = 40 \\)\n  - Set \\( 10 + 5Q = 40 \\) \u2192 \\( Q = 6 \\)\n- **Private Q (Ignore Orchard)**:\n  - \\( 10 + 5Q = 30 \\) \u2192 \\( Q = 4 \\)\n\n---\n\n## **5. Decision-Making Under Uncertainty**\n### **Key Concepts**\n- **Expected Value (EV)**:\n  - \\( EV = \\sum p_i \\times \\text{Payoff}_i \\)\n- **Decision Rule**: Choose option with highest EV.\n\n### **Example (Q32-Q33: MBA Decision)**\n| Labor Market | Probability | Payoff (MBA) | Payoff (No MBA) |\n|--------------|-------------|--------------|-----------------|\n| Strong       | \\( p \\)      | 32           | 12              |\n| Average      | 0.5          | 16           | 8               |\n| Weak         | \\( 0.5 - p \\) | 12           | 4               |\n\n#### **Key Calculations**\n1. **EV (MBA)**:\n   - \\( 32p + 16 \\times 0.5 + 12(0.5 - p) = 28p + 14 \\)\n2. **EV (No MBA)**:\n   - \\( 12p + 8 \\times 0.5 + 4(0.5 - p) = 8p + 6 \\)\n3. **Choose MBA if**:\n   - \\( 28p + 14 > 8p + 6 \\) \u2192 \\( 20p > -8 \\) \u2192 Always true if \\( p > 0 \\).\n   - **But cost = 10**, so:\n     - \\( 28p + 14 - 10 > 8p + 6 \\) \u2192 \\( 20p > 2 \\) \u2192 \\( p > 0.1 \\)\n   - **Do not choose MBA if \\( p \\leq 0.1 \\)** *(Answer key says \\( p \\nleq \\frac{1}{6} \\), i.e., \\( p > 0.166 \\).)*\n\n---\n\n## **6.
