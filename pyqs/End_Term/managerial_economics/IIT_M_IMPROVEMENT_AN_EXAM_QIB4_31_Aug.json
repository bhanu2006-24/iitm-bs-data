        "summary": "Here\u2019s a structured **summary of core topics, concepts, principles, and equations** for the **Managerial Economics (Computer-Based Exam)**, along with **Mermaid knowledge graphs** to visualize relationships.\n\n---\n\n## **Core Topics & Concepts**\n### **1. Monopoly & Pricing Strategies**\n#### **Key Concepts:**\n- **Profit Maximization**: \\( MR = MC \\)\n- **Price Elasticity of Demand (PED)**: \\( e_d = \\frac{\\% \\Delta Q_d}{\\% \\Delta P} \\)\n- **Markup Pricing**: \\( P = \\frac{MC}{1 + \\frac{1}{e_d}} \\)\n- **Marginal Revenue (MR)**: \\( MR = P \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{e_d}\\right) \\)\n- **Profit Calculation**: \\( \\pi = TR - TC = (P \\times Q) - (AC \\times Q + FC) \\)\n\n#### **Equations:**\n1. **Marginal Cost (MC) from PED**:\n   \\[\n   MC = P \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{e_d}\\right)\n   \\]\n   *(Given \\( P = 40 \\), \\( e_d = -2 \\), \\( MC = 20 \\))*\n\n2. **Markup as % of Price**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Markup (\\%)} = \\frac{P - MC}{P} \\times 100 = \\frac{1}{|e_d|} \\times 100\n   \\]\n   *(Given \\( e_d = -2 \\), markup = 50%)*\n\n3. **Profit Calculation**:\n   \\[\n   \\pi = (P - AC) \\times Q - FC\n   \\]\n   *(Given \\( P = 40 \\), \\( AC = 15 \\), \\( Q = 800 \\), \\( FC = 2000 \\), \\( \\pi = 20,000 \\))*\n\n---\n\n### **2. Asymmetric Information & Signaling**\n#### **Key Concepts:**\n- **Adverse Selection**: Low-quality products drive out high-quality ones (e.g., used cars).\n- **Moral Hazard**: Hidden actions (e.g., risk-taking after insurance).\n- **Signaling**: High-quality firms use costly signals (e.g., warranties) to differentiate.\n- **Screening**: Buyers induce sellers to reveal quality (e.g., insurance deductibles).\n\n#### **Equations:**\n1. **Cost of Warranty**:\n   - Hamid (high-quality): \\( 500Y \\)\n   - Latif (low-quality): \\( 1000Y \\)\n\n2. **Profit with/without Warranty**:\n   - **Hamid (no warranty)**:\n     \\[\n     \\pi_H = 7500 - 7000 = 500\n     \\]\n   - **Hamid (1-year warranty)**:\n     \\[\n     \\pi_H = 9000 - 7000 - 500(1) = 1500\n     \\]\n   - **Latif (no warranty)**:\n     \\[\n     \\pi_L = 7500 - 4000 = 3500\n     \\]\n   - **Latif (1-year warranty)**:\n     \\[\n     \\pi_L = 6000 - 4000 - 1000(1) = 1000\n     \\]\n\n3. **Credible Signal**:\n   - A **2-year warranty** is credible because Latif\u2019s cost (\\( 1000 \\times 2 = 2000 \\)) exceeds his profit margin.\n\n---\n\n### **3. International Trade & Tariffs**\n#### **Key Concepts:**\n- **Domestic Equilibrium**: \\( Q^d = Q^s \\)\n- **Free Trade**: Imports = \\( Q^d - Q^s \\) at world price.\n- **Tariff Effects**:\n  - **Consumer Surplus (CS)**: \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times Q \\times \\Delta P \\)\n  - **Producer Surplus (PS)**: \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times Q \\times \\Delta P \\)\n  - **Government Revenue**: \\( t \\times Q_{\\text{import}} \\)\n  - **Deadweight Loss (DWL)**: \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times t \\times \\Delta Q \\)\n\n#### **Equations:**\n1. **Domestic Equilibrium Price**:\n   \\[\n   Q^d = 100 - P, \\quad Q^s = P\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   100 - P = P \\implies P^* = 50\n   \\]\n\n2. **Imports Without Tariff**:\n   \\[\n   Q^d = 100 - 20 = 80, \\quad Q^s = 20 \\implies \\text{Imports} = 60\n   \\]\n\n3. **Imports With Tariff (\\( t = 10 \\))**:\n   \\[\n   P_{\\text{new}} = 20 + 10 = 30\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   Q^d = 100 - 30 = 70, \\quad Q^s = 30 \\implies \\text{Imports} = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Surplus Changes**:\n   - **CS (without tariff)**:\n     \\[\n     CS = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 80 \\times (100 - 20) = 3200 \\quad (\\text{in '000s})\n     \\]\n   - **PS (without tariff)**:\n     \\[\n     PS = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 20 \\times 20 = 200 \\quad (\\text{in '000s})\n     \\]\n   - **Government Revenue**:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Revenue} = 10 \\times 40 = 400 \\quad (\\text{in '000s})\n     \\]\n\n---\n\n### **4. Tax Incidence & Market Efficiency**\n#### **Key Concepts:**\n- **Tax Burden**: Shared between consumers and producers based on elasticity.\n- **Deadweight Loss (DWL)**: Loss in total surplus due to tax.\n- **Consumer/Producer Surplus**: Area under demand/supply curve.\n\n#### **Equations:**\n1. **Equilibrium Before Tax**:\n   \\[\n   P = 300 - Q, \\quad P = 60 + 2Q\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   300 - Q = 60 + 2Q \\implies Q^* = 80, \\quad P^* = 220\n   \\]\n\n2. **Equilibrium After Tax (\\( t = 15 \\))**:\n   \\[\n   P_d = 300 - Q, \\quad P_s = 60 + 2Q + 15\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   300 - Q = 75 + 2Q \\implies Q^* = 75, \\quad P_d = 225, \\quad P_s = 210\n   \\]\n\n3. **Surplus Changes**:\n   - **CS Before Tax**:\n     \\[\n     CS = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 80 \\times (300 - 220) = 3200\n     \\]\n   - **PS Before Tax**:\n     \\[\n     PS = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 80 \\times (220 - 60) = 6400\n     \\]\n   - **Tax Revenue**:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Revenue} = 15 \\times 75 = 1125\n     \\]\n   - **DWL**:\n     \\[\n     DWL = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 15 \\times (80 - 75) = 37.5\n     \\]\n\n---\n\n### **5. Externalities & Social Efficiency**\n#### **Key Concepts:**\n- **Positive Externality**: Benefit to third parties (e.g., beekeeping pollinates orchards).\n- **Socially Efficient Quantity**: \\( MB = MC \\)\n\n#### **Equations:**\n1. **Private Optimum (Ignore Externality)**:\n   \\[\n   MC = 10 + 5Q = 30 \\implies Q = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Social Optimum (Include Externality)**:\n   \\[\n   MB = 30 + 10 = 40 \\quad (\\text{ honey + pollination benefit})\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   MC = 10 + 5Q = 40 \\implies Q = 6\n   \\]\n\n---\n\n### **6. Decision Making Under Uncertainty**\n#### **Key Concepts:**\n- **Expected Utility**: \\( E(U) = \\sum p_i \\times U(x_i) \\)\n- **Risk Aversion**: Prefer certain outcomes over gambles with same expected value.\n\n#### **Equations:**\n1. **Expected Value of MBA**:\n   \\[\n   E(\\text{MBA}) = p \\times 32 + 0.5 \\times 16 + (0.5 - p) \\times 12 - 10\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   E(\\text{No MBA}) = p \\times 12 + 0.5 \\times 8 + (0.5 - p) \\times 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Critical Probability (\\( p \\))**:\n   \\[\n   E(\\text{MBA}) > E(\\text{No MBA}) \\implies p > \\frac{1}{6}\n   \\]\n\n---\n\n### **7. Monopolistic Competition & Price Discrimination**\n#### **Key Concepts:**\n- **Differentiated Products**: Firms compete on quality, brand, or location.\n- **First-Degree Price Discrimination**: Charge each consumer their reservation price.\n- **Pareto Efficiency**: No way to make someone better off without hurting another.\n\n#### **Equations:**\n1. **Monopolist Pricing**:\n   \\[\n   D(p) = 100 - 2p \\implies p = 50 - \\frac{Q}{2}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   MR = 50 - Q, \\quad MC = 0 \\implies Q = 50, \\quad p = 25\n   \\]\n\n---\n\n## **Mermaid Knowledge Graphs**\n### **1.
