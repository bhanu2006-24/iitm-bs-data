In Spark, there is another class of user defined routines called UDAFs, which stand for User Defined Aggregator Functions. UDAFs are meant to provide a means to write a custom aggregation function which aggregates over a grouping of values to arrive at a single value. UDAF structure differs saliently from UDFs in that it provides a buffer to keep track of intermediate state before finalizing aggregate output. Why is a buffer required for UDAF and not for a UDF?"
