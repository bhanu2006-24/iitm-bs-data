        "summary": "Here\u2019s a structured **summary of core topics, concepts, and principles** for the **Software Testing** exam, along with **key equations** (where applicable) and **Mermaid knowledge graphs** to visualize relationships.\n\n---\n\n## **1. Core Topics & Concepts**\n### **A. Testing Fundamentals**\n1. **Types of Testing**\n   - **Functional Testing**: Validates software against functional requirements (e.g., form submissions, date validations).\n   - **Non-Functional Testing**:\n     - **Performance Testing**:\n       - **Spike Testing**: Sudden load increase to measure system stability (Q4).\n       - **Endurance Testing**: Long-duration testing to check memory leaks.\n     - **Compatibility Testing**: Ensures software works across different environments.\n     - **Regulatory Testing**: Compliance with standards.\n   - **Structural Testing**: White-box testing (e.g., code coverage, mutation testing).\n   - **Behavioral Testing**: Black-box testing (e.g., boundary value analysis).\n\n2. **Test Coverage Criteria**\n   - **Statement Coverage**: Every line of code executed at least once.\n   - **Branch Coverage**: Every decision outcome (true/false) tested.\n   - **Path Coverage**: All possible paths in the control flow graph (CFG) tested.\n   - **Mutation Testing**: Introduces small changes (mutants) to verify test suite effectiveness (Q6, Q14, Q17\u2013Q19).\n     - **Mutation Operators**:\n       - **Scalar Variable Replacement (SVR)**: Replace a variable with another (Q6).\n       - **Super Keyword Deletion (SKD)**: Remove `super` calls (Q14).\n       - **Arithmetic Operator Replacement (AOR)**: Change `*` to `+`, etc.\n       - **Unary Operator Insertion (UOI)**: Add/remove unary operators (e.g., `!`, `-`).\n\n3. **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**\n   - **Red-Green-Refactor Cycle**:\n     1. Write a failing test (Red).\n     2. Write minimal code to pass the test (Green).\n     3. Refactor code while keeping tests passing.\n   - **Pair Programming**: One developer writes code, the other writes tests (Q7).\n\n---\n\n### **B. Graph-Based Testing**\n1. **Application Transition Graph (ATG)**\n   - Models transitions between application states (e.g., web form submission \u2192 confirmation page).\n   - **Types of Transitions**:\n     - **Simple Link Transition**: Direct navigation (e.g., hyperlinks).\n     - **Form Link Transition**: Submission-driven transition (Q2).\n     - **Operational Transition**: State change due to user actions.\n     - **Redirect Transition**: Server-side redirects.\n\n2. **Finite State Machines (FSM)**\n   - **Acceptance Criteria**: FSMs define valid/invalid input sequences (Q10).\n   - Example: FSM accepting strings with odd `a`s and even `b`s.\n\n3. **Control Flow Graph (CFG)**\n   - **Nodes**: Statements/decision points.\n   - **Edges**: Control flow paths.\n   - **Def-Clear Paths**: Paths where a variable\u2019s definition is not overwritten (Q20).\n   - **Prime Paths**: Simple paths between nodes without repetition (Q12).\n     - **Sidetrip**: Detour that returns to the prime path (e.g., `[1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 5]`).\n     - **Detour**: Permanent deviation from the prime path.\n\n4. **Data Flow Testing**\n   - **All-Defs Coverage**: Every definition of a variable is exercised.\n   - **All-Uses Coverage**: Every use of a variable\u2019s definition is tested.\n   - **All-DU-Paths Coverage**: All definition-use paths are covered (Q21).\n\n---\n\n### **C. Test Case Design Techniques**\n1. **Boundary Value Analysis (BVA)**\n   - Tests boundaries of input partitions (e.g., `58 \u2264 weight \u2264 78` \u2192 test `57, 58, 78, 79`) (Q16).\n   - **Robust BVA**: Includes values just outside boundaries.\n\n2. **Equivalence Partitioning**\n   - Divides input data into valid/invalid classes (e.g., `check-out date \u2265 check-in date`).\n\n3. **Symbolic Execution**\n   - Executes code with symbolic variables (e.g., `a\u2080`, `b\u2080`) to derive path constraints (Q15).\n   - **Path Constraints**: Conditions for traversing specific paths (e.g., `(a\u2080 + 5)\u00b2 < 2*(b\u2080 - 3) \u2227 (a\u2080 + 5) > (b\u2080 - 3)`).\n\n4. **Clause Coverage**\n   - **Restricted Inactive Clause Coverage (RICC)**: Ensures each clause affects the predicate outcome (Q22\u2013Q23).\n   - Example: For `p = a \u2227 (\u00acb \u2228 \u00acc)`, test cases must show `a`\u2019s influence on `p`.\n\n---\n\n### **D. Software Quality Metrics**\n1. **Maintenance Metrics**\n   - **Defect Density**: Defects per size unit (e.g., defects/KLOC).\n   - **Backlog Management Index (BMI)**: Measures unresolved issue backlog (Q5).\n   - **Cyclomatic Complexity**: Number of independent paths in code (indicates maintainability).\n\n2. **Coupling and Cohesion**\n   - **Coupling Types** (Q8):\n     - **Message-Passing**: Modules communicate via messages (e.g., ride-sharing app).\n     - **Parameter Coupling**: Data passed via parameters.\n     - **Shared Data Coupling**: Modules share global data.\n     - **External Device Coupling**: Interaction with external systems.\n\n---\n\n### **E. Faults and Anomalies**\n1. **Common Fault Types**\n   - **State Definition Anomaly**: Inconsistent variable states (e.g., shadowing in inheritance) (Q13).\n   - **Infection vs. Propagation**:\n     - **Infection**: Mutant alters program state.\n     - **Propagation**: Infection affects output (Q17\u2013Q19).\n   - **Strong Kill**: Test case detects mutant and causes failure (e.g., palindrome test with `\"refer\"` kills mutant) (Q19).\n\n2. **Grammar-Based Testing**\n   - **Context-Free Grammars (CFG)**: Generate valid/invalid inputs (Q9).\n   - Example: Grammar `S \u2192 aSbb | abb` generates strings like `aabb`, `aaabbbb`.\n\n---\n\n## **2. Key Equations**\n### **A. Cyclomatic Complexity (V(G))**\n\\[\nV(G) = E - N + 2P\n\\]\n- \\(E\\): Number of edges in CFG.\n- \\(N\\): Number of nodes.\n- \\(P\\): Number of connected components (usually 1).\n\n### **B. Path Constraints (Symbolic Execution)**\nFor code:\n```java\nif (power(t1) < multiply(t2)) {\n    if (t1 > t2) { ... }\n}\n```\nPath constraints (Q15):\n1. \\((a\u2080 + 5)\u00b2 < 2(b\u2080 - 3) \u2227 (a\u2080 + 5) > (b\u2080 - 3)\\)\n2. \\((a\u2080 + 5)\u00b2 \u2265 2(b\u2080 - 3) \u2227 (a\u2080 + 5) > (b\u2080 - 3)\\)\n\n### **C. Mutation Score**\n\\[\n\\text{Mutation Score} = \\frac{\\text{Number of Killed Mutants}}{\\text{Total Mutants}} \\times 100\\%\n\\]\n\n---\n\n## **3.
