        "summary": "Here\u2019s a structured **summary of core topics, concepts, and equations** for the **Software Testing** exam, followed by **Mermaid knowledge graphs** to visualize relationships.\n\n---\n\n## **1. Core Topics & Concepts**\n### **A. Software Testing Fundamentals**\n1. **Types of Testing**\n   - **Functional Testing**: Validates software against requirements (e.g., form submissions, date validations).\n   - **Non-Functional Testing**:\n     - **Performance Testing**:\n       - **Spike Testing**: Sudden load increase to measure system stability (Q4).\n       - **Endurance Testing**: Long-duration testing for memory leaks.\n     - **Compatibility Testing**: Ensures software works across environments.\n     - **Security Testing**: Validates access controls and data integrity.\n   - **Structural Testing**: White-box techniques (e.g., code coverage, mutation testing).\n\n2. **Test Techniques**\n   - **Boundary Value Analysis (BVA)**: Tests boundaries of input partitions (Q16).\n     - For a range `[58, 78]`, test cases: `{57, 58, 78, 79}`.\n   - **Equivalence Partitioning**: Divides input data into valid/invalid classes.\n   - **Decision Table Testing**: Systematic evaluation of input combinations.\n   - **State Transition Testing**: Validates system behavior across states (Q10).\n\n3. **Test Coverage Criteria**\n   - **Statement Coverage**: Every line of code executed.\n   - **Branch Coverage**: Every decision outcome (true/false) tested.\n   - **Path Coverage**: All possible paths in the control flow graph (CFG) (Q12, Q20, Q21).\n   - **Mutation Testing**: Introduces faults (mutants) to evaluate test suite effectiveness (Q6, Q14, Q17\u2013Q19).\n     - **Mutation Operators**:\n       - **Arithmetic Operator Replacement (AOR)**: Changes `*` to `+` (Q6).\n       - **Super Keyword Deletion (SKD)**: Removes `super.method()` (Q14).\n       - **Scalar Variable Replacement (SVR)**: Replaces variables (e.g., `c` \u2192 `b`).\n\n4. **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**\n   - **Red-Green-Refactor Cycle**:\n     1. Write a failing test (Red).\n     2. Implement minimal code to pass (Green).\n     3. Refactor while keeping tests passing.\n   - **Pair Programming**: One developer writes code; the other writes tests (Q7).\n\n---\n\n### **B. Software Design & Architecture**\n1. **Coupling Types** (Q8)\n   - **Message-Passing Coupling**: Modules communicate via messages/queues (e.g., ride-sharing app).\n   - **Parameter Coupling**: Modules share data via parameters.\n   - **Shared Data Coupling**: Modules access shared global data.\n   - **External Device Coupling**: Modules interact with hardware/externals.\n\n2. **Application Transition Graph (ATG)** (Q2)\n   - **Form Link Transition**: Submitting a form triggers a page transition.\n   - **Simple Link Transition**: Static hyperlinks.\n   - **Operational Transition**: User actions (e.g., button clicks).\n\n3. **Control Flow Graph (CFG)** (Q15, Q20, Q21)\n   - **Nodes**: Statements/decision points.\n   - **Edges**: Control flow paths.\n   - **Def-Clear Path**: A path where a variable\u2019s definition is not overwritten (Q20).\n   - **Prime Paths**: Simple paths without repeated nodes (Q12).\n   - **Sidetrip**: A detour that returns to the original path (e.g., `[1,2,3,2,4,5]`).\n   - **Detour**: A permanent deviation from the original path.\n\n4. **Symbolic Execution** (Q15)\n   - **Path Constraints**: Logical conditions derived from code branches.\n     - Example: For `if (power(t1) < multiply(t2))`, constraints are:\n       - `(t1\u00b2 < 2*t2) \u2227 (t1 > t2)`\n       - `(t1\u00b2 \u2265 2*t2) \u2227 (t1 \u2264 t2)`\n\n---\n\n### **C. Formal Methods & Automata**\n1. **Context-Free Grammars (CFG)** (Q9)\n   - **Production Rules**: Define language syntax.\n     - Example: `S \u2192 aSbb | abb` generates strings like `aabb`, `aaabbb`, etc.\n     - Language: `{ a\u207fb\u00b2\u207f | n \u2265 1 }` (Option A in Q9).\n\n2. **Finite State Machines (FSM)** (Q10)\n   - **Acceptance Criteria**: Strings that lead to a final state.\n     - Example: FSM accepting odd `a`s and odd `b`s (Option C in Q10).\n\n3. **Logical Coverage Criteria** (Q22\u2013Q23)\n   - **Predicate Coverage**: Tests all outcomes of a logical expression.\n     - Example: For `p = a \u2227 (\u00acb \u2228 \u00acc)`, test:\n       - `a=T, b=T, c=T` \u2192 `p=F`\n       - `a=T, b=F, c=T` \u2192 `p=T`\n   - **Restricted Inactive Clause Coverage (RICC)**: Ensures each clause affects the predicate.\n     - For clause `a` in `p`, test:\n       - `p=T`: `(a=T, b=T, c=F)` and `(a=F, b=T, c=F)`.\n       - `p=F`: `(a=T, b=T, c=T)` and `(a=F, b=T, c=T)`.\n\n---\n\n### **D. Code Anomalies & Faults**\n1. **State Definition Anomalies** (Q13)\n   - **State Visibility Anomaly**: Child class hides parent\u2019s variable (e.g., `Laptop.memorySizeGB` shadows `Device.memorySizeGB`).\n   - **Inconsistent Type Use**: Mismatched data types.\n   - **State Definition Inconsistency**: Conflicting variable definitions across inheritance.\n\n2. **Mutation Faults** (Q17\u2013Q19)\n   - **Infection**: A mutant causes a state change (e.g., incorrect loop in `isPalindrome`).\n   - **Propagation**: The infected state affects output (e.g., non-palindromes like `\"river\"`).\n   - **Strong Kill**: Test case detects the mutant (e.g., `\"refer\"` kills the loop mutant).\n\n---\n\n### **E. Metrics & Quality Assurance**\n1. **Maintenance Quality Metrics** (Q5)\n   - **Backlog Management Index (BMI)**: Measures unresolved issue backlog.\n   - **Defect Density**: Defects per size unit (e.g., defects/KLOC).\n   - **Cyclomatic Complexity**: Code complexity based on decision points.\n\n2. **Performance Metrics**\n   - **Throughput**: Transactions per second.\n   - **Response Time**: Time to process a request.\n   - **Resource Utilization**: CPU/memory usage under load.\n\n---\n\n## **2. Key Equations & Formulas**\n### **A. Boundary Value Analysis (BVA)**\nFor a range `[min, max]`:\n- Test cases: `{min-1, min, (min+max)/2, max, max+1}`.\n\n### **B. Cyclomatic Complexity (V(G))**\nFor a control flow graph:\n```\nV(G) = E - N + 2P\n```\n- `E`: Number of edges.\n- `N`: Number of nodes.\n- `P`: Number of connected components (usually 1).\n\n### **C. Mutation Score**\n```\nMutation Score = (Killed Mutants / Total Mutants) \u00d7 100%\n```\n\n### **D. Logical Predicate Coverage**\nFor a predicate `p = a \u2227 (\u00acb \u2228 \u00acc)`:\n- **Truth Table**:\n  | a | b | c | \u00acb \u2228 \u00acc | p   |\n  |---|---|---|---------|-----|\n  | T | T | T | F       | F   |\n  | T | T | F | T       | T   |\n  | T | F | T | T       | T   |\n  | F | T | T | F       | F   |\n\n---\n\n## **3.
