Core Topics & Concepts**\n### **A. Testing Fundamentals**\n1. **Types of Testing**\n   - **Functional Testing**: Validates software against functional requirements (e.g., boundary value analysis, equivalence partitioning).\n   - **Non-Functional Testing**:\n     - **Performance Testing** (Load, Stress, Endurance/Soak, Spike).\n     - **Security Testing** (Value-level bypass, parameter-level bypass).\n   - **Structural Testing**: White-box testing (code coverage, mutation testing).\n   - **Transition Testing**: Application Transition Graph (ATG) for navigation testing.\n\n2. **Test Coverage Criteria**\n   - **Statement Coverage**: Every statement executed at least once.\n   - **Branch Coverage**: Every decision outcome (true/false) tested.\n   - **Path Coverage**: All possible paths in the control flow graph (CFG) tested.\n   - **Data Flow Coverage** (All-Defs, All-Uses, All-DU-Paths).\n   - **Mutation Testing**: Evaluates test suite effectiveness by introducing faults (mutants).\n\n3. **Test Case Design Techniques**\n   - **Boundary Value Analysis (BVA)**: Tests at and around input boundaries (e.g., `17, 18, 19, 37, 38, 39` for `18 \u2264 age \u2264 38`).\n   - **Equivalence Partitioning**: Divides input data into valid/invalid partitions.\n   - **Decision Table Testing**: Systematic evaluation of combinations of conditions.\n   - **State Transition Testing**: Tests transitions between system states (e.g., FSM-based testing).\n\n4. **Metrics**\n   - **In-Process Quality Metrics**:\n     - **Defect Density**: `# of defects / size of software`.\n     - **Code Coverage**: `% of code executed by test cases`.\n   - **Post-Process Metrics**:\n     - **Backlog Management Index (BMI)**: Tracks unresolved defects.\n     - **Cyclomatic Complexity**: Measures code complexity (`V(G) = E - N + 2P`).\n\n---\n\n### **B. Advanced Testing Concepts**\n1. **Mutation Testing**\n   - **Mutation Operators**:\n     - **Arithmetic Operator Replacement (AOR)**: Changes `+` to `-` (e.g., `+sqrt` \u2192 `-sqrt`).\n     - **Relational Operator Replacement (ROR)**: Changes `>` to `<`.\n     - **Statement Deletion**: Removes a method or line (e.g., deleting an overloaded method).\n     - **Variable Replacement**: Replaces a variable with another (e.g., `memorySizeGB` \u2192 `mainMemory`).\n   - **Mutant Classification**:\n     - **Live Mutant**: Not killed by any test case.\n     - **Killed Mutant**: Detected by a test case.\n     - **Equivalent Mutant**: Semantically identical to the original.\n\n2. **Symbolic Execution**\n   - Generates path constraints to explore all feasible paths.\n   - Example: For `if (square(t1) < divide(t2))`, constraints are:\n     - `(t1\u00b2 < t2/2) \u2227 (t1 < t2)` (path 1).\n     - `(t1\u00b2 \u2265 t2/2) \u2228 (t1 \u2265 t2)` (path 2).\n\n3. **Control Flow & Data Flow Analysis**\n   - **Def-Clear Paths**: Paths where a variable\u2019s definition is not overwritten before use.\n   - **DU-Pairs (Definition-Use)**: Tracks variable definitions and their uses.\n   - **Prime Paths**: Simple paths in a CFG without repeated nodes.\n\n4. **Coupling & Cohesion**\n   - **Parameter Coupling**: Modules communicate via parameters (e.g., `SalaryCalculation` \u2192 `TaxCalculation`).\n   - **Shared Data Coupling**: Modules share global data (riskier).\n   - **Message-Passing**: Modules communicate via messages (e.g., APIs).\n\n5. **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**\n   - **Advantages**: Early bug detection, improved design, better test coverage.\n   - **Disadvantages**:\n     - Heavy reliance on test frameworks.\n     - Not ideal for large-scale projects without proper tooling.\n\n---\n\n### **C. Formal Methods & Automata**\n1. **Finite State Machines (FSM)**\n   - **Acceptance Criteria**: Strings that lead to a final state.\n   - Example: FSM accepting strings ending with `'a'` or with odd `'b'`s.\n\n2. **Context-Free Grammars (CFG)**\n   - **Production Rules**: Define language syntax (e.g., `S \u2192 aaSb | aab`).\n   - **Language Generation**: Derive strings from grammar (e.g., `{a\u00b2\u207fb\u207f | n \u2265 1}`).\n\n3. **Predicate Coverage**\n   - **Restricted Inactive Clause Coverage (RICC)**: Ensures each clause affects the predicate outcome.\n   - Example: For `p = a \u2228 (\u00acb \u2227 \u00acc)`, test cases must show `a` determines `p` when `(\u00acb \u2227 \u00acc)` is inactive.\n\n---\n\n### **D. Software Faults & Anomalies**\n1. **Fault Types**\n   - **State Definition Anomaly**: Incorrect variable usage (e.g., `Laptop::setMemorySize` updates `mainMemory` instead of `memorySizeGB`).\n   - **Method Overriding Issues**: Child class method hides parent class logic.\n   - **Infection vs. Propagation**:\n     - **Infection**: Mutant causes a state change (e.g., skipping first character in `vowelCount`).\n     - **Propagation**: Infection affects the output (e.g., input `\"apple\"` propagates the mutant).\n\n2. **Strong vs. Weak Mutation**\n   - **Strong Killing**: Mutant\u2019s state differs at every step.\n   - **Weak Killing**: Only the final output differs.\n\n---\n\n## **2.

Exam Preparation Tips**\n1. **Focus Areas**:\n   - **Mutation Testing**: Understand operators (AOR, ROR, statement deletion) and mutant classification.\n   - **Symbolic Execution**: Practice deriving path constraints (e.g., `t1\u00b2 < t2/2`).\n   - **FSM & Grammars**: Learn to derive languages from production rules (e.g., `S \u2192 aaSb | aab`).\n   - **Coverage Criteria**: Know the differences between statement, branch, path, and data flow coverage.\n   - **Boundary Value Analysis**: Always test `min-1, min, min+1, max-1, max, max+1`.\n\n2. **Practice Problems**:\n   - Given a CFG, identify def-clear paths or DU-pairs.\n   - For a mutant, determine if it\u2019s killed by a test case (e.g., `vowelCount` with `i=1`).\n   - Derive test cases for BVA (e.g., `applicant_age` between 18 and 38).\n   - Analyze FSMs to determine accepted languages (e.g., strings ending with `'a'`).\n\n3. **Common Pitfalls**:\n   - Confusing **parameter coupling** with **shared data coupling**.\n   - Misapplying **mutation operators** (e.g., AOR vs. ROR).\n   - Incorrectly deriving **path constraints** in symbolic execution.\n   - Overlooking **equivalent mutants** in mutation testing.",
