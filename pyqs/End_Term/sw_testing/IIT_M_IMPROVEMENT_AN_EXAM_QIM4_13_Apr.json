        "summary": "Here\u2019s a structured **summary of core topics, concepts, principles, and equations** for the **Software Testing** exam, followed by **Mermaid knowledge graphs** to visualize relationships.\n\n---\n\n## **Core Topics & Concepts**\n### **1. Software Testing Fundamentals**\n- **Types of Testing**:\n  - **Functional Testing**: Validates software against functional requirements (e.g., form submissions, date validations).\n  - **Non-Functional Testing**:\n    - **Performance Testing**:\n      - **Spike Testing**: Sudden load increase to measure system stability (Q4).\n      - **Endurance Testing**: Long-term system behavior under sustained load.\n    - **Compatibility Testing**: Ensures software works across different environments.\n    - **Regulatory Testing**: Compliance with standards/laws.\n  - **Structural Testing**: White-box testing (e.g., code coverage, mutation testing).\n  - **Pairwise Testing**: Tests combinations of input parameters.\n\n- **Test Levels**:\n  - Unit, Integration, System, Acceptance.\n\n- **Test Techniques**:\n  - **Boundary Value Analysis (BVA)**: Tests at input boundaries (e.g., `candidate_weight` in Q16).\n    - Test cases: `{57, 58, 78, 79}` for range `[58, 78]`.\n  - **Equivalence Partitioning**: Divides input data into equivalent classes.\n  - **Decision Table Testing**: Tests combinations of conditions/actions.\n  - **State Transition Testing**: Validates state changes (e.g., Application Transition Graph in Q2).\n\n---\n\n### **2. Test Coverage & Adequacy Criteria**\n- **Code Coverage Metrics**:\n  - **Statement Coverage**: Every statement executed at least once.\n  - **Branch Coverage**: Every decision outcome (true/false) tested.\n  - **Path Coverage**: All possible paths in the CFG executed.\n  - **Mutation Coverage**: Measures how many mutants are killed (Q6, Q14, Q17\u2013Q19).\n\n- **Requirement Adequate Coverage Criteria (RACC)**:\n  - Ensures test cases cover all functional requirements (Q11).\n  - Example: For `compute(x, y, z)`, test cases must cover:\n    - `x > y` (sets `r = true`).\n    - `r && x == z` (returns `x` or `z`).\n\n- **Prime Path Testing**:\n  - **Prime Path**: A path in the CFG that does not repeat nodes (except start/end).\n  - **Sidetrip**: A detour that returns to the prime path (Q12).\n  - **Detour**: A deviation that does not return to the prime path.\n\n- **Def-Use Coverage**:\n  - **All-Defs Coverage**: Every definition of a variable is exercised.\n  - **All-Uses Coverage**: Every use of a variable\u2019s definition is tested.\n  - **Def-Clear Path**: A path where no redefinition of a variable occurs (Q20).\n\n---\n\n### **3. Mutation Testing**\n- **Mutation Operators**:\n  - **Scalar Variable Replacement (SVR)**: Replaces a variable with another (Q6).\n    - Example: Replace `c` with `b` in `b*b - 4*a*c`.\n  - **Arithmetic Operator Replacement (AOR)**: Changes operators (e.g., `+` to `-`).\n  - **Super Keyword Deletion (SKD)**: Removes `super` calls (Q14).\n  - **Overriding Method Deletion (OMD)**: Deletes overridden methods.\n\n- **Mutant Analysis**:\n  - **Infection**: A mutant causes a state change.\n  - **Propagation**: The infected state affects the output.\n  - **Killing a Mutant**: A test case detects the mutant\u2019s effect.\n    - Example (Q17\u2013Q19):\n      - Mutant in `isPalindrome`: Loop condition changed to `i >= 0`.\n      - **Infection**: Always true for non-empty strings.\n      - **Propagation**: Only fails for non-palindromes (e.g., \"river\").\n      - **Strong Kill**: Test case must expose the mutant (e.g., \"refer\" kills it).\n\n---\n\n### **4. Model-Based Testing**\n- **Finite State Machines (FSM)**:\n  - States (`S1`, `S2`, etc.) and transitions (`a`, `b`).\n  - **Acceptance Criteria**: Strings that lead to an accept state (Q10).\n    - Example: FSM accepts strings with **odd `a`s and odd `b`s**.\n\n- **Context-Free Grammars (CFG)**:\n  - Production rules generate languages (Q9).\n    - Example: Grammar `S \u2192 aSbb | abb` generates `{a^n b^{2n} | n \u2265 1}`.\n\n- **Application Transition Graph (ATG)**:\n  - Models transitions between application states (Q2).\n    - **Form Link Transition**: Submitting a form (e.g., web form \u2192 confirmation page).\n\n---\n\n### **5. Software Quality Metrics**\n- **Maintenance Quality Metrics**:\n  - **Backlog Management Index (BMI)**: Measures efficiency in resolving backlog items (Q5).\n  - **Defect Density**: Defects per size unit (e.g., per KLOC).\n  - **Cyclomatic Complexity**: Measures code complexity (higher = harder to maintain).\n\n- **Coupling & Cohesion**:\n  - **Message-Passing Coupling**: Modules communicate via messages (e.g., ride-sharing app in Q8).\n  - **Tight Coupling**: High dependency between modules (harder to test).\n\n---\n\n### **6. Symbolic Execution & Path Constraints**\n- **Symbolic States**: Variables represented symbolically (e.g., `a = a0`, `b = b0`).\n- **Path Constraints**: Conditions that must hold for a path to execute (Q15).\n  - Example:\n    - Path 1: `(a0 + 5)\u00b2 < 2*(b0 - 3) \u2227 (a0 + 5) > (b0 - 3)`\n    - Path 2: `(a0 + 5)\u00b2 < 2*(b0 - 3) \u2227 (a0 + 5) \u2264 (b0 - 3)`\n\n---\n\n### **7. Test-Driven Development (TDD) & Pair Programming**\n- **TDD Workflow**:\n  1. Write a failing test.\n  2. Write minimal code to pass the test.\n  3. Refactor.\n- **Pair Programming in TDD**:\n  - One developer writes tests, the other implements code (Q7).\n\n---\n\n### **8. Faults & Anomalies**\n- **State Definition Anomalies**:\n  - **Variable Hiding**: Child class variable hides parent class variable (Q13).\n    - Example: `Laptop.memorySizeGB` hides `Device.memorySizeGB`.\n  - **Inconsistent Type Use**: Mismatched data types.\n  - **State Visibility Anomaly**: Variables not accessible as expected.\n\n---\n\n### **9. Logical Coverage Criteria**\n- **Clause Coverage**:\n  - **Restricted Inactive Clause Coverage (RICC)**: Tests where a clause does not affect the predicate\u2019s outcome (Q23).\n    - Example: For `p = a \u2227 (\u00acb \u2228 \u00acc)`, RICC for `a`:\n      - `p = T`: No feasible pair (since `a` must be `T`).\n      - `p = F`: `(a = T, b = T, c = T)` and `(a = F, b = T, c = T)`.\n\n- **Predicate Determination**:\n  - Conditions where a clause alone determines the predicate (Q22).\n    - For `p = a \u2227 (\u00acb \u2228 \u00acc)`, `a` determines `p` when `\u00acb \u2228 \u00acc = T` (i.e., `b \u2227 c = F`).\n\n---\n\n## **Key Equations & Formulas**\n1. **Cyclomatic Complexity (V(G))**:\n   ```\n   V(G) = E - N + 2P\n   ```\n   - `E`: Number of edges in the CFG.\n   - `N`: Number of nodes.\n   - `P`: Number of connected components.\n\n2. **Boundary Value Analysis (BVA)**:\n   - For range `[min, max]`, test cases: `{min-1, min, (min+max)/2, max, max+1}`.\n\n3. **Mutation Score**:\n   ```\n   Mutation Score = (Killed Mutants) / (Total Mutants) * 100%\n   ```\n\n4. **Path Constraints (Symbolic Execution)**:\n   - Example: For `if (x > y && x == z)`, constraints:\n     - `x > y \u2227 x == z` (true branch).\n     - `\u00ac(x > y \u2227 x == z)` (false branch).\n\n---\n\n## **Mermaid Knowledge Graphs**\n### **Graph 1: Testing Techniques & Coverage**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Software Testing] --> B[Functional Testing]\n    A --> C[Non-Functional Testing]\n    A --> D[Structural Testing]\n\n    B --> B1[Boundary Value Analysis]\n    B --> B2[Equivalence Partitioning]\n    B --> B3[Decision Tables]\n\n    C --> C1[Performance Testing]\n    C1 --> C1a[Spike Testing]\n    C1 --> C1b[Endurance Testing]\n    C --> C2[Compatibility Testing]\n    C --> C3[Security Testing]\n\n    D --> D1[Code Coverage]\n    D1 --> D1a[Statement Coverage]\n    D1 --> D1b[Branch Coverage]\n    D1 --> D1c[Path Coverage]\n    D --> D2[Mutation Testing]\n    D --> D3[Symbolic Execution]\n```\n\n### **Graph 2: Mutation Testing Workflow**\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n    A[Original Code] -->|Apply Mutant| B[Mutant]\n    B -->|Run Test Cases| C{Infection?}\n    C -->|Yes| D{Propagation?}\n    C -->|No| E[Mutant Lives]\n    D -->|Yes| F{Output Differs?}\n    D -->|No| E\n    F -->|Yes| G[Mutant Killed]\n    F -->|No| E\n```\n\n### **Graph 3: Model-Based Testing**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Model-Based Testing] --> B[Finite State Machines]\n    A --> C[Context-Free Grammars]\n    A --> D[Application Transition Graphs]\n\n    B --> B1[States & Transitions]\n    B --> B2[Acceptance Criteria]\n\n    C --> C1[Production Rules]\n    C --> C2[Language Generation]\n\n    D --> D1[Simple Link Transition]\n    D --> D2[Form Link Transition]\n    D --> D3[Operational Transition]\n```\n\n### **Graph 4: Test Coverage Hierarchy**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Coverage Criteria] --> B[Structural Coverage]\n    A --> C[Logical Coverage]\n\n    B --> B1[All-Defs Coverage]\n    B --> B2[All-Uses Coverage]\n    B --> B3[All-DU-Paths Coverage]\n\n    C --> C1[Clause Coverage]\n    C --> C2[RICC]\n    C --> C3[Predicate Coverage]\n```\n\n### **Graph 5: TDD & Pair Programming**\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n    A[Test-Driven Development] --> B[Write Failing Test]\n    B --> C[Write Minimal Code]\n    C --> D[Refactor]\n    D --> B\n\n    A --> E[Pair Programming]\n    E --> E1[Developer 1: Writes Tests]\n    E --> E2[Developer 2: Implements Code]\n```",
