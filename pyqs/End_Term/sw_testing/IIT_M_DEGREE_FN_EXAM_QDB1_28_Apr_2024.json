        "summary": "Here\u2019s a structured summary of the **core topics, concepts, principles, and equations** essential for the **Software Testing** exam, followed by **Mermaid knowledge graphs** to visualize relationships.\n\n---\n\n---\n\n### **Core Topics & Concepts**\n#### **1. Software Metrics**\n   - **Backlog Management Index (BMI)**: A **maintenance quality metric** (Q2).\n   - **Types of Metrics**:\n     - Product quality metrics (e.g., defect density).\n     - In-process quality metrics (e.g., code review efficiency).\n     - Project metrics (e.g., schedule variance).\n     - **Maintenance metrics** (e.g., BMI, mean time to repair).\n\n#### **2. Testing Types**\n   - **Performance Testing**:\n     - **Load Testing**: Simulate expected load.\n     - **Stress Testing**: Push beyond limits.\n     - **Soak Testing**: Monitor long-term stability (e.g., memory leaks) (Q3).\n     - **Spike Testing**: Sudden load spikes.\n   - **Client-Side Testing**:\n     - **Control Flow Bypass Testing**: Disrupt normal execution (e.g., back/refresh buttons, direct URL entry) (Q4).\n   - **Mutation Testing**:\n     - **Mutants**:\n       - **Stillborn**: Invalid (compilation fails).\n       - **Trivial**: Killed by any test case (Q5).\n       - **Equivalent**: Semantically identical to original.\n       - **Dead**: No impact on output.\n     - **Mutation Operators**:\n       - **Argument Order Change (AOC)**: Swap argument positions (Q9).\n       - **Overriding/Overloading Method Change (OMM/OMC)**.\n\n#### **3. Finite State Machines (FSM)**\n   - **Preconditions**: Conditions required for state transitions (Q6).\n   - **Transitions**: Triggered by events/conditions.\n   - **Application Transition Graph (ATG)**:\n     - **Form Link Transition**: Form submission (Q8).\n     - **Component Expression Transition**: Server-side logic.\n     - **Operational Transition**: User actions (e.g., button clicks).\n     - **Redirect Transition**: Invisible to the user (e.g., HTTP 302).\n\n#### **4. Coupling in Software Design**\n   - **Types of Coupling** (Q7):\n     - **Parameter Coupling**: Data passed via parameters.\n     - **Shared Data Coupling**: Shared global data.\n     - **External Device Coupling**: Shared external resources (e.g., files).\n     - **Message-Passing**: Communication via messages.\n\n#### **5. Grammar & Language Theory**\n   - **Context-Free Grammar (CFG)**:\n     - **Production Rules**: Define syntax (Q11).\n     - **Language Generation**: Derive strings from rules.\n     - Example:\n       ```\n       S \u2192 aXbb\n       X \u2192 aXbb | abb\n       ```\n       Generates strings like `a^n b^{2n}` (e.g., `abb`, `aabbbb`).\n\n#### **6. Test Coverage Criteria**\n   - **Each Choice Coverage (ECC)**: Cover all choices in partitions (Q12).\n     - Example: For partitions `Gender (3)`, `Age (2)`, `Salary (4)`, minimum tests = max choices = **4**.\n   - **Edge-Pair Coverage**: Test all consecutive edge pairs in a CFG (Q21).\n     - For a CFG with `E` edges, edge-pair coverage = `|E| - 1` (if acyclic) + cycles.\n   - **Prime Path Coverage**: Test all simple paths (no repeated nodes) (Q22).\n   - **Predicate Coverage**:\n     - **Restricted Active Clause Coverage (RACC)**: Clause must affect predicate outcome (Q19).\n     - **Restricted Inactive Clause Coverage (RICC)**: Clause must not affect outcome (Q20).\n\n#### **7. Symbolic Execution**\n   - **Symbolic Values**: Represent inputs as symbols (e.g., `r_i`).\n   - **Path Constraints**: Conditions to explore paths.\n   - Example (Q13):\n     ```java\n     pr = \u220f_{i \u2208 [a+1, a+n]} r_i  // Product of 'n' positive inputs.\n     ```\n\n#### **8. Component-Based Testing**\n   - **Component Expression**: Algebraic representation of workflows (Q14).\n     - Example:\n       ```\n       P1: (P2 | (P3 \u00b7 P4* \u00b7 (P5 | P6))) \u00b7 P7\n       ```\n   - **Anomalies in Inheritance**:\n     - **Inconsistent Type Use**: Parent method breaks child invariants (Q15).\n     - **State Visibility Anomaly**: Child cannot access parent state.\n\n#### **9. Test-Driven Development (TDD)**\n   - **Advantages** (Q16):\n     - Fault isolation.\n     - Ideal for pair programming (one codes, one tests).\n   - **Disadvantages**:\n     - High dependency on test frameworks.\n     - Potential code bloat.\n\n#### **10. Logical Coverage (DNF/CNF)**\n   - **Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF)**: OR of ANDs (Q18).\n     - Example: `(u \u2227 v) \u2228 (y \u2227 z) \u2228 x`.\n   - **Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF)**: AND of ORs.\n\n#### **11. Object-Oriented Testing**\n   - **Inheritance Issues**:\n     - **Method Overriding/Overloading**: Can introduce faults.\n     - **Shadowing**: Child variables hide parent variables (Q17).\n   - **Polymorphism**: Dynamic method binding (Q10).\n     - Example: `C::f()` called for `obj.f()` where `obj` is of type `C`.\n\n---\n\n---\n\n### **Key Equations & Formulas**\n1. **CFG Edge-Pair Coverage**:\n   - Number of requirements = `|E|` (edges) + cycles.\n   - For Q21: 9 edges + 1 cycle (6\u21925) = **11 requirements**.\n\n2. **Prime Path Coverage**:\n   - Count all simple paths (no repeated nodes).\n   - For Q22: 9 prime paths (e.g., 1\u21922\u21924\u21925\u21926\u21925\u21927).\n\n3. **Each Choice Coverage (ECC)**:\n   - Minimum tests = maximum choices across partitions.\n   - For Q12: `max(3, 2, 4) = 4`.\n\n4. **Symbolic Execution Product** (Q13):\n   -\n   ```\n   pr = r\u2081 \u00b7 r\u2082 \u00b7 ... \u00b7 r\u2099  (for n positive inputs)\n   ```\n\n5. **Grammar Language** (Q11):\n   -\n   ```\n   L = { a\u207f b\u00b2\u207f | n \u2265 1 }\n   ```\n\n6. **Predicate Coverage**:\n   - **RACC**: Pairs where clause `a` is active (e.g., `(2,6)`, `(3,7)`, `(4,8)`).\n   - **RICC**: Pairs where clause `a` is inactive (e.g., `(1,5)` for `p=true`).\n\n---\n\n---\n\n### **Mermaid Knowledge Graphs**\n#### **Graph 1: Testing Types & Metrics**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Software Testing] --> B[Performance Testing]\n    A --> C[Client-Side Testing]\n    A --> D[Mutation Testing]\n    A --> E[FSM-Based Testing]\n\n    B --> B1[Load Testing]\n    B --> B2[Stress Testing]\n    B --> B3[Soak Testing]\n    B --> B4[Spike Testing]\n\n    C --> C1[Control Flow Bypass]\n    C --> C2[Value Bypass]\n    C --> C3[Parameter Bypass]\n\n    D --> D1[Mutants]\n    D1 --> D1a[Stillborn]\n    D1 --> D1b[Trivial]\n    D1 --> D1c[Equivalent]\n    D1 --> D1d[Dead]\n    D --> D2[Operators]\n    D2 --> D2a[AOC]\n    D2 --> D2b[OMM]\n\n    E --> E1[Preconditions]\n    E --> E2[Transitions]\n    E --> E3[ATG]\n```\n\n#### **Graph 2: Test Coverage Criteria**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Test Coverage] --> B[Structural Coverage]\n    A --> C[Logical Coverage]\n    A --> D[Model-Based Coverage]\n\n    B --> B1[Statement Coverage]\n    B --> B2[Branch Coverage]\n    B --> B3[Path Coverage]\n    B --> B4[Edge-Pair Coverage]\n    B --> B5[Prime Path Coverage]\n\n    C --> C1[Predicate Coverage]\n    C --> C2[Clause Coverage]\n    C --> C3[RACC]\n    C --> C4[RICC]\n    C --> C5[DNF/CNF]\n\n    D --> D1[FSM Coverage]\n    D --> D2[CFG Coverage]\n    D --> D3[Each Choice Coverage]\n```\n\n#### **Graph 3: Grammar & Symbolic Execution**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Formal Methods] --> B[Context-Free Grammar]\n    A --> C[Symbolic Execution]\n\n    B --> B1[Production Rules]\n    B --> B2[Language Generation]\n    B --> B3[Example: a\u207fb\u00b2\u207f]\n\n    C --> C1[Symbolic Values]\n    C --> C2[Path Constraints]\n    C --> C3[Example: Product of Inputs]\n```\n\n#### **Graph 4: Object-Oriented Testing**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[OOP Testing] --> B[Inheritance]\n    A --> C[Polymorphism]\n    A --> D[Encapsulation]\n\n    B --> B1[Method Overriding]\n    B --> B2[Shadowing]\n    B --> B3[State Inconsistency]\n\n    C --> C1[Dynamic Binding]\n    C --> C2[Test Case: C::f()]\n\n    D --> D1[Access Modifiers]\n    D --> D2[Test Failures]\n```\n\n#### **Graph 5: TDD & Metrics**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Software Quality] --> B[Test-Driven Development]\n    A --> C[Metrics]\n\n    B --> B1[Fault Isolation]\n    B --> B2[Pair Programming]\n    B --> B3[Pros/Cons]\n\n    C --> C1[Product Metrics]\n    C --> C2[Process Metrics]\n    C --> C3[Maintenance Metrics]\n    C --> C4[BMI]\n```\n\n---\n---\n\n### **Exam Preparation Tips**\n1. **Focus Areas**:\n   - **Mutation Testing**: Understand operators (AOC, OMM) and mutant types.\n   - **Coverage Criteria**: Edge-pair, prime path, RACC/RICC.\n   - **FSM/ATG**: Transitions and preconditions.\n   - **Grammar**: Derive languages from production rules.\n   - **Symbolic Execution**: Track symbolic values in loops.\n\n2. **Practice**:\n   - Draw CFGs for small code snippets and compute edge-pair/prime path coverage.\n   - Write truth tables for predicates and identify RACC/RICC pairs.\n   - Solve CFG problems (e.g., count paths, identify cycles).\n\n3. **Common Pitfalls**:\n   - Confusing **soak testing** (long-term) with **stress testing** (breakpoint).\n   - Misapplying **ECC** (minimum tests = max choices, not product).\n   - Overlooking **trivial mutants** (killed by any test case).",
