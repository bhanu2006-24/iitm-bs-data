Core Topics & Concepts**\n#### **A. Software Testing Fundamentals**\n1. **Types of Testing**\n   - **Functional Testing**: Validates software against functional requirements (e.g., unit, integration, system testing).\n   - **Non-Functional Testing**:\n     - **Performance Testing**:\n       - **Load Testing**: Tests system behavior under expected load.\n       - **Stress Testing**: Tests beyond normal load to find breaking points.\n       - **Soak Testing**: Monitors system over extended periods to detect memory leaks (Q3).\n       - **Spike Testing**: Tests sudden load spikes.\n     - **Security Testing**: Includes **control flow bypass testing** (e.g., back button, URL manipulation) (Q4).\n   - **Mutation Testing**:\n     - **Mutants**: Modified versions of code to test test suite effectiveness.\n     - **Types of Mutants**:\n       - **Stillborn**: Invalid mutants (compilation errors).\n       - **Trivial**: Killed by almost any test case (Q5).\n       - **Equivalent**: Semantically identical to original.\n       - **Dead**: No impact on output.\n     - **Mutation Operators**:\n       - **Argument Order Change (AOC)**: Swaps argument order (Q9).\n       - **Argument Number Change (ANC)**, **Overriding Method Moving (OMM)**, etc.\n\n2. **Test Coverage Criteria**\n   - **Structural Coverage**:\n     - **Statement/Decision/Branch Coverage**: Ensures all code paths are tested.\n     - **Path Coverage**: Tests all possible paths (e.g., prime paths in CFG) (Q21, Q22).\n   - **Logical Coverage**:\n     - **Predicate Coverage**: Tests all combinations of logical conditions.\n     - **Clause Coverage**: Tests individual clauses in predicates.\n     - **Restricted Active/Inactive Clause Coverage (RACC/RICC)**: Ensures clauses influence predicate outcome (Q19, Q20).\n     - **Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF)**: Logical expressions as OR of ANDs (Q18).\n   - **Data Flow Coverage**: Tracks variable definitions/uses.\n   - **Each Choice Coverage (ECC)**: Covers each choice in input partitions (Q12).\n\n3. **Model-Based Testing**\n   - **Finite State Machines (FSM)**:\n     - **States/Transitions**: Represent system behavior.\n     - **Preconditions**: Conditions for transitions (Q6).\n   - **Application Transition Graph (ATG)**: Models web app transitions (Q8).\n     - **Form Link Transition**: Form submissions.\n     - **Component Expression Transition**: Server-side actions.\n     - **Operational Transition**: User actions (e.g., back button).\n     - **Redirect Transition**: Invisible server-side redirects.\n\n4. **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**\n   - **Advantages**:\n     - Early fault isolation (Q16).\n     - Suitable for pair programming.\n     - High test coverage.\n   - **Disadvantages**:\n     - High initial effort.\n     - Dependency on test frameworks.\n\n5. **Metrics in Software Testing**\n   - **Product Quality Metrics**: Measure final product quality (e.g., defect density).\n   - **In-Process Quality Metrics**: Track development process (e.g., code review efficiency).\n   - **Maintenance Quality Metrics**: Post-release metrics (e.g., Backlog Management Index (BMI)) (Q2).\n   - **Project Metrics**: Track progress (e.g., velocity, burndown charts).\n\n6. **Coupling in Software Design**\n   - **Types of Coupling**:\n     - **Parameter Coupling**: Data passed via parameters.\n     - **Shared Data Coupling**: Shared global variables.\n     - **External Device Coupling**: Shared external objects (e.g., files) (Q7).\n     - **Message-Passing**: Communication via messages.\n\n7. **Faults and Anomalies**\n   - **Inconsistent Type Use**: Mismatch between expected/actual types (Q15).\n   - **State Definition Anomaly**: Inconsistent state representations.\n   - **Inheritance Issues**: Overriding/method shadowing (Q10, Q17).\n\n8. **Symbolic Execution**\n   - Executes code with symbolic inputs to explore paths.\n   - Example: Tracking `pr` in a loop with symbolic inputs (Q13).\n\n---\n\n#### **B. Key Equations & Mathematical Concepts**\n1. **Context-Free Grammar (CFG) for Language Generation** (Q11):\n   - Given grammar:\n     ```\n     S \u2192 aXbb\n     X \u2192 aXbb | abb\n     ```\n   - **Language Generated**: \\( L = \\{ a^n b^{2n} | n \\geq 1 \\} \\).\n   - Derivation: Strings with `n` `a`s followed by `2n` `b`s.\n\n2. **Prime Path Coverage** (Q22):\n   - **Prime Paths**: Simple paths in CFG with no repeated nodes (except start/end).\n   - For CFG \\( G = (V, E) \\):\n     - \\( V = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\\} \\)\n     - \\( E = \\{(1,2), (1,3), (2,4), (3,4), (4,5), (4,7), (5,6), (5,7), (6,5)\\} \\)\n   - **Prime Paths**:\n     1. 1-2-4-5-6-5-7\n     2. 1-2-4-5-7\n     3. 1-2-4-7\n     4. 1-3-4-5-6-5-7\n     5. 1-3-4-5-7\n     6. 1-3-4-7\n     7. 4-5-6-5 (cycle)\n     8. 5-6-5 (cycle)\n     9. 4-5-7\n   - **Total Requirements**: 9 (excluding trivial cycles).\n\n3. **Edge-Pair Coverage** (Q21):\n   - Covers all consecutive edge pairs in CFG.\n   - For \\( |E| = 9 \\), edge pairs = 11 (e.g., (1,2)-(2,4), (1,3)-(3,4), etc.).\n\n4. **Each Choice Coverage (ECC)** (Q12):\n   - Covers each choice in input partitions **at least once**.\n   - Partitions:\n     - Gender: 3 choices (\"MALE\", \"FEMALE\", \"OTHER\").\n     - Age: 2 choices ([0-60), [60+]).\n     - Salary: 4 choices.\n   - **Minimum Tests**: Max choices in any partition = 4 (salary).\n\n5. **Symbolic Execution Product Calculation** (Q13):\n   - Loop executes for `n` positive inputs followed by a negative input.\n   - `pr` accumulates product of inputs: \\( pr = \\prod_{i \\in [a+1, a+n]} r_i \\).\n\n6. **Predicate Logic** (Q19, Q20):\n   - For \\( p = a \\lor (b \\land c) \\):\n     - **RACC**: Pairs where clause `a` is **active** (influences `p`).\n       - Example: (2,6), (3,7), (4,8).\n     - **RICC**: Pairs where clause `a` is **inactive** (does not influence `p`).\n       - Example: (1,5) for `p=true` (no feasible pair for `p=false`).\n\n---\n\n### **2.
