Core Topics & Concepts**\n### **A. Testing Fundamentals**\n1. **Types of Testing**\n   - **Functional Testing**: Validates software against functional requirements (e.g., boundary value analysis, equivalence partitioning).\n   - **Non-Functional Testing**:\n     - **Performance Testing**:\n       - **Endurance (Soak) Testing**: Detects memory leaks under prolonged load (Q4).\n       - **Spike Testing**: Sudden load spikes.\n     - **Security Testing**:\n       - **Value-Level Bypass Testing**: Inputs extreme/invalid values (e.g., age = -5) to check robustness (Q3).\n   - **Structural Testing**: White-box testing (e.g., code coverage, mutation testing).\n\n2. **Test Metrics**\n   - **In-Process Quality Metrics**:\n     - **Defect Density**: Defects per size (e.g., defects/KLOC) (Q5).\n     - **Code Coverage**: % of code executed by tests.\n     - **Cyclomatic Complexity**: Measures code complexity (not in options but related).\n   - **Backlog Management Index (BMI)**: Project management metric (not in-process).\n\n---\n\n### **B. Test Design Techniques**\n1. **Boundary Value Analysis (BVA)**\n   - Test cases at and around boundaries (e.g., for `18 \u2264 age \u2264 38`, test `17, 18, 19, 37, 38, 39`) (Q16).\n   - **Robust BVA**: Includes values beyond boundaries.\n\n2. **Equivalence Partitioning**\n   - Divide input domain into valid/invalid partitions (e.g., age < 18, 18\u201338, >38).\n\n3. **Decision/Condition Coverage**\n   - **RACC (Requirement All Coverage Criteria)**: Covers all combinations of predicates (Q11).\n     - Example: For `if (r || x == z)`, test:\n       - `x > y` (true/false).\n       - `r=true`, `r=false && x==z` (true/false).\n\n4. **Mutation Testing**\n   - **Mutation Operators**:\n     - **Arithmetic Operator Replacement (AOR)**: Changes `+` to `-` (Q6).\n     - **Overloading Method Deletion (OMD)**: Removes overloaded methods (Q14).\n     - **Unary Operator Insertion**: Adds/removes unary operators (e.g., `!`).\n   - **Mutant Analysis**:\n     - **Infection**: Mutant causes a state change (e.g., skipping first character in `vowelCount` infects the count) (Q17).\n     - **Propagation**: Infection affects output (e.g., input `\"area\"` propagates the error) (Q18).\n     - **Strong Kill**: Test case detects the mutant (e.g., `\"every\"` kills Mutant-1) (Q19).\n\n---\n\n### **C. Model-Based Testing**\n1. **Finite State Machines (FSM)**\n   - **Transition Testing**: Verify transitions between states (Q10).\n     - Example: FSM accepts strings with **even `a`s and odd `b`s**.\n   - **State Coverage**: Visit all states.\n   - **Transition Coverage**: Exercise all transitions.\n\n2. **Application Transition Graph (ATG)**\n   - **Simple Link Transition**: Hyperlink navigation (e.g., homepage \u2192 \"About Us\") (Q2).\n   - **Form Link Transition**: Submitting a form.\n   - **Operational Transition**: Button clicks, API calls.\n\n3. **Prime Paths & Coverage**\n   - **Prime Path**: Simple path without repeated nodes (e.g., `[1, 2, 4, 5]`) (Q12).\n   - **Sidetrip**: Deviates from prime path but returns (e.g., `[1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 5]`).\n   - **Detour**: Does not return to the prime path.\n\n4. **Control Flow Graph (CFG)**\n   - **Def-Clear Path**: Path where a variable\u2019s definition is not overwritten (e.g., `[1, 3, 4, 5, 7]` for `x`) (Q20).\n   - **All-Defs Coverage**: Every definition of a variable is exercised.\n   - **All-Uses Coverage**: Every use of a variable is covered (Q21).\n\n---\n\n### **D. Code-Level Testing**\n1. **Coupling & Cohesion**\n   - **Parameter Coupling**: Modules communicate via parameters (e.g., `SalaryCalculation` \u2194 `TaxCalculation`) (Q8).\n   - **Shared Data Coupling**: Modules share global data (avoid this).\n\n2. **Faults & Anomalies**\n   - **State Definition Anomaly**: Incorrect state handling (e.g., `Laptop::setMemorySize` doesn\u2019t update `memorySizeGB`) (Q13).\n   - **Inconsistent Type Use**: Mismatched data types.\n   - **State Visibility Anomaly**: Hidden/overridden states.\n\n3. **Symbolic Execution**\n   - **Path Constraints**: Conditions to reach a code path (Q15).\n     - Example: For `if (square(t1) < divide(t2)) && (t1 < t2)`, constraints are:\n       ```latex\n       ((a_0 + 1)^2 < (b_0 - 2)/2) \u2227 (a_0 + 1 < b_0 - 2)\n       ```\n\n---\n\n### **E. Logic Coverage**\n1. **Clause Determination**\n   - For predicate `p = a \u2228 (\u00acb \u2227 \u00acc)`, clause `a` determines `p` when `\u00acb \u2228 \u00acc` is true (i.e., `b \u2228 c` is false) (Q22).\n   - **Restricted Inactive Clause Coverage (RICC)**: Test inactive clauses (Q23).\n     - Example: For `p = T`, test `(a=T, b=T, c=F)` and `(a=F, b=T, c=F)`.\n\n---\n\n### **F. Grammar & Language Testing**\n1. **Context-Free Grammars (CFG)**\n   - Generate strings from production rules (Q9).\n     - Example: Grammar `S \u2192 aaSb | aab` generates language `{a^(2n+1)b^n | n \u2265 1}`.\n\n---\n\n## **2.
