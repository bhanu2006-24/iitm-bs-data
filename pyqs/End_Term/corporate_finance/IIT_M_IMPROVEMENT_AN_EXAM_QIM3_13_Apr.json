        "summary": "Here\u2019s a structured **summary of core topics, concepts, principles, and equations** for the **Corporate Finance (Computer-Based Exam)**, followed by **Mermaid knowledge graphs** to visualize relationships.\n\n---\n\n---\n\n### **Core Topics & Key Concepts**\n#### **1. Portfolio Theory & Diversification**\n- **Diversification**: Reduces unsystematic (firm-specific) risk by combining assets with **low/negative correlation**.\n  - *Example*: Two assets moving in opposite directions (Q2).\n- **Systematic vs. Unsystematic Risk**:\n  - Systematic: Market-wide (beta measures exposure).\n  - Unsystematic: Firm-specific (diversifiable).\n- **Correlation Coefficient (\u03c1)**:\n  - Ranges from **-1 (perfect negative) to +1 (perfect positive)**.\n  - Used in portfolio variance calculations.\n\n#### **2. Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)**\n- **Equation**:\n  \\[\n  E(R_i) = R_f + \\beta_i [E(R_m) - R_f]\n  \\]\n  - \\(E(R_i)\\): Expected return of asset \\(i\\).\n  - \\(R_f\\): Risk-free rate.\n  - \\(\\beta_i\\): Beta (systematic risk measure).\n  - \\(E(R_m) - R_f\\): Market risk premium.\n- **Key Points**:\n  - Only **systematic risk** is priced (Q5).\n  - **Security Market Line (SML)**: Plots expected return vs. beta (Q6).\n    - Overpriced stocks lie **below SML** (Q7).\n  - **Risk-averse investors** prefer **lower beta** (not higher; Q4).\n\n#### **3. Beta (\u03b2) & Company Beta**\n- **Beta Calculation**:\n  \\[\n  \\beta = \\frac{\\text{Covariance}(R_i, R_m)}{\\text{Variance}(R_m)}\n  \\]\n  - Measures sensitivity to market movements.\n  - **Negative beta**: Asset moves opposite to the market (Q3).\n- **Company Beta**:\n  - Weighted average of divisional betas (Q22):\n    \\[\n    \\beta_{\\text{company}} = w_1 \\beta_1 + w_2 \\beta_2\n    \\]\n    - \\(w_i\\): Asset weight of division \\(i\\).\n\n#### **4. Option Pricing & Strategies**\n- **Call vs. Put Options**:\n  - **Call**: Right (not obligation) to **buy** at strike price.\n  - **Put**: Right (not obligation) to **sell** at strike price.\n  - **Intrinsic Value**:\n    - Call: \\(\\max(S - K, 0)\\)\n    - Put: \\(\\max(K - S, 0)\\)\n    - *At-the-money (ATM)* options have **zero intrinsic value** (Q9).\n- **Option Greeks**:\n  - **Delta (\u0394)**:\n    - Call: \\(0 \\leq \\Delta \\leq 1\\) (positive).\n    - Put: \\(-1 \\leq \\Delta \\leq 0\\) (negative; Q11).\n  - **Put-Call Parity** (Q30):\n    \\[\n    C + \\frac{K}{(1+r)^T} = P + S\n    \\]\n    - \\(C\\): Call price, \\(P\\): Put price, \\(S\\): Stock price, \\(K\\): Strike price.\n- **Black-Scholes Model**:\n  - Put option price change (Q21):\n    \\[\n    \\Delta P = -N(d_1) \\Delta S\n    \\]\n    - If \\(N(d_1) = 0.4\\), put price **decreases by 0.4** when stock price increases by 1.\n- **Option Strategies**:\n  - **Covered Call**: Long stock + write call (Q26).\n  - **Protective Put**: Long stock + buy put.\n  - **Straddle**: Buy call + put (same strike/expiry).\n\n#### **5. Risk & Return Metrics**\n- **Sharpe Ratio** (Q16):\n  \\[\n  \\text{Sharpe Ratio} = \\frac{E(R_i) - R_f}{\\sigma_i}\n  \\]\n  - Measures **excess return per unit of risk**.\n- **Capital Allocation Line (CAL)**:\n  - Slope = \\(\\frac{E(R_i) - R_f}{\\sigma_i}\\) (Q17).\n  - Example: \\((15\\% - 4\\%) / 10\\% = 1.1\\).\n\n#### **6. Time Value of Money (TVM)**\n- **Present Value (PV)** of cash flows (Q18):\n  \\[\n  PV = \\sum \\frac{CF_t}{(1 + r)^t}\n  \\]\n  - Example: \\(5000/(1.1)^1 + 10000/(1.1)^2 + 20000/(1.1)^3 \\approx 27,836\\).\n- **Gordon Growth Model** (Q35):\n  \\[\n  P = \\frac{D_1}{r - g}\n  \\]\n  - \\(D_1\\): Next dividend, \\(r\\): Discount rate, \\(g\\): Growth rate.\n  - If \\(P_{\\text{market}} > P_{\\text{model}}\\), stock is **overpriced**.\n\n#### **7. International Finance**\n- **Interest Rate Parity (IRP)** (Q19):\n  \\[\n  \\frac{1 + r_{\\text{THB}}}{1 + r_{\\text{CNY}}} = \\frac{F}{S}\n  \\]\n  - Approximation: \\(r_{\\text{THB}} - r_{\\text{CNY}} \\approx \\% \\Delta \\text{THB/CNY}\\).\n  - Example: \\(9\\% - 4\\% = 5\\%\\) \u2192 THB **depreciates by ~4.59%** (not appreciates).\n\n#### **8. Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH)**\n- **Forms**:\n  - Weak: Prices reflect past data.\n  - Semi-strong: Prices reflect all public info.\n  - Strong: Prices reflect all info (public/private).\n- **Implication**: Cannot consistently beat the market (Q8).\n\n#### **9. Financial Trilemma**\n- Cannot simultaneously have:\n  1. **Financial stability**.\n  2. **Independent monetary policy**.\n  3. **Free capital mobility** (Q14).\n\n#### **10. Portfolio Mathematics**\n- **Portfolio Expected Return** (Q32):\n  \\[\n  E(R_p) = w_A E(R_A) + w_B E(R_B)\n  \\]\n- **Portfolio Variance**:\n  \\[\n  \\sigma_p^2 = w_A^2 \\sigma_A^2 + w_B^2 \\sigma_B^2 + 2 w_A w_B \\sigma_A \\sigma_B \\rho_{AB}\n  \\]\n- **Covariance**:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Cov}(A, B) = \\rho_{AB} \\sigma_A \\sigma_B\n  \\]\n  - Example: \\(\\rho = 0.8\\), \\(\\sigma_A = 20\\%\\), \\(\\sigma_B = 25\\%\\) \u2192 Cov = \\(0.8 \\times 0.2 \\times 0.25 = 0.04\\) (4%).\n\n---\n\n---\n\n### **Key Equations Summary**\n| **Concept**               | **Equation**                                                                 |\n|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| CAPM                      | \\(E(R_i) = R_f + \\beta_i [E(R_m) - R_f]\\)                                   |\n| Beta                      | \\(\\beta_i = \\frac{\\text{Cov}(R_i, R_m)}{\\text{Var}(R_m)}\\)                  |\n| Sharpe Ratio              | \\(\\frac{E(R_i) - R_f}{\\sigma_i}\\)                                           |\n| Put-Call Parity           | \\(C + \\frac{K}{(1+r)^T} = P + S\\)                                            |\n| Black-Scholes Delta (Put) | \\(\\Delta P = -N(d_1) \\Delta S\\)                                             |\n| PV of Cash Flows          | \\(PV = \\sum \\frac{CF_t}{(1 + r)^t}\\)                                         |\n| Gordon Growth Model       | \\(P = \\frac{D_1}{r - g}\\)                                                   |\n| Portfolio Return          | \\(E(R_p) = \\sum w_i E(R_i)\\)                                                |\n| Portfolio Variance        | \\(\\sigma_p^2 = \\sum w_i^2 \\sigma_i^2 + 2 \\sum w_i w_j \\sigma_i \\sigma_j \\rho_{ij}\\) |\n| Interest Rate Parity      | \\(\\frac{1 + r_{\\text{home}}}{1 + r_{\\text{foreign}}} = \\frac{F}{S}\\)        |\n\n---\n\n---\n\n### **Mermaid Knowledge Graphs**\n#### **Graph 1: Portfolio Theory & CAPM**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Portfolio Theory] --> B[Diversification]\n    A --> C[Systematic vs. Unsystematic Risk]\n    B --> D[Correlation Coefficient]\n    C --> E[Beta]\n    E --> F[CAPM]\n    F --> G[Security Market Line]\n    G --> H[Over/Underpriced Securities]\n    F --> I[Expected Return Calculation]\n```\n\n#### **Graph 2: Option Pricing**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Options] --> B[Call Option]\n    A --> C[Put Option]\n    B --> D[Intrinsic Value]\n    C --> D\n    A --> E[Option Greeks]\n    E --> F[Delta]\n    E --> G[Put-Call Parity]\n    A --> H[Black-Scholes Model]\n    H --> I[Delta Hedging]\n    A --> J[Strategies]\n    J --> K[Covered Call]\n    J --> L[Protective Put]\n```\n\n#### **Graph 3: Risk & Return Metrics**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Risk & Return] --> B[Sharpe Ratio]\n    A --> C[Capital Allocation Line]\n    A --> D[Time Value of Money]\n    D --> E[Present Value]\n    D --> F[Gordon Growth Model]\n    A --> G[Portfolio Math]\n    G --> H[Expected Return]\n    G --> I[Variance/Covariance]\n```\n\n#### **Graph 4: International Finance & EMH**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[International Finance] --> B[Interest Rate Parity]\n    A --> C[Exchange Rates]\n    D[Efficient Market Hypothesis] --> E[Weak Form]\n    D --> F[Semi-Strong Form]\n    D --> G[Strong Form]\n    A --> H[Financial Trilemma]\n```\n\n---\n---\n\n### **Exam Tips**\n1. **CAPM & Beta**: Master the formula and interpretations (e.g., negative beta, SML).\n2. **Options**: Focus on **put-call parity**, **intrinsic value**, and **Greeks** (especially delta).\n3. **Portfolio Math**: Know how to calculate **expected return**, **variance**, and **covariance**.\n4. **TVM**: Practice **PV calculations** for uneven cash flows.\n5. **Black-Scholes**: Understand how option prices change with **stock price, volatility, and time**.\n6. **EMH & Trilemma**: Conceptual questions (no calculations).\n7. **Sharpe Ratio**: Compare risk-adjusted returns.",
