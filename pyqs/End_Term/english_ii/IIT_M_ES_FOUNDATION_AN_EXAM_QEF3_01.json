We arrived in Kolkata two days before and the first thing that struck us on landing at the airport was the security. There were commandos everywhere and no fans were allowed near the hotel lobby. This was no ordinary match. Someone had mentioned to us that the surface at Eden Gardens had been relaid with soil brought over from Australia. The first look at the surface seemed to support this statement, with the pitch apparently hard and firm. In fact, it did look like a typical Australian wicket. On that basis, it was unanimously decided that we should field first if we won the toss, particularly because Sri Lanka had chased very well throughout the tournament. Their openers, Sanath Jayasuriya and Romesh Kaluwitharana, had been going for the bowling in the first fifteen overs and had given them fantastic starts in most matches. They had beaten us in the pool stage of the competition and it was important to take early wickets and put them under pressure. We won the toss and put the Sri Lankans in and got off to a great start, picking up Sanath for one and Kalu for zero. They both got out playing cut shots to third man, vindicating our belief that the wicket was hard and firm. It was only when I came on to bowl that I realized we had misread the wicket. The ball started to hold up and was stopping as it reached the batsmen. The top layer might have been firm enough, but immediately below the surface it was loose. It would clearly not last the full hundred overs and it became even more important to keep Sri Lanka down to a manageable score. Though we managed to restrict Sri Lanka to 251 in their fifty overs, that proved far too many in the end. When it was our turn to bat, the wicket had started doing all sorts of things. The ball was turning and holding up and batting was extremely difficult. Opening, I scored 65 but got out rather strangely to a ball from Sanath Jayasuriya. He was bowling left-arm orthodox spin and the ball hit my pad and rolled off to the on side. I thought there was a quick single and stepped out of the crease. Too late, I saw that the ball had stopped very close to Kaluwitharana, the keeper, and there was no way I could finish the run, but by then it was too late. He dislodged the stumps in a flash and I didn\u2019t bother waiting for the third umpire\u2019s decision because I knew I was out. It was a long and frustrating walk back to the pavilion and I could sense it would not be easy for the batsmen who followed. Sure enough, we soon lost wickets in a heap, handing Sri Lanka the game. The crowd, desperate for an Indian victory, grew increasingly restless and disrupted the game by throwing things onto the field. By then, however, the match was all over. Our World Cup dream lay shattered and there was a deathly silence in the dressing room. (Playing it My Way : My Autobiography - Sachin Tendulkar)",

We arrived in Kolkata two days before and the first thing that struck us on landing at the airport was the security. There were commandos everywhere and no fans were allowed near the hotel lobby. This was no ordinary match. Someone had mentioned to us that the surface at Eden Gardens had been relaid with soil brought over from Australia. The first look at the surface seemed to support this statement, with the pitch apparently hard and firm. In fact, it did look like a typical Australian wicket. On that basis, it was unanimously decided that we should field first if we won the toss, particularly because Sri Lanka had chased very well throughout the tournament. Their openers, Sanath Jayasuriya and Romesh Kaluwitharana, had been going for the bowling in the first fifteen overs and had given them fantastic starts in most matches. They had beaten us in the pool stage of the competition and it was important to take early wickets and put them under pressure. We won the toss and put the Sri Lankans in and got off to a great start, picking up Sanath for one and Kalu for zero. They both got out playing cut shots to third man, vindicating our belief that the wicket was hard and firm. It was only when I came on to bowl that I realized we had misread the wicket. The ball started to hold up and was stopping as it reached the batsmen. The top layer might have been firm enough, but immediately below the surface it was loose. It would clearly not last the full hundred overs and it became even more important to keep Sri Lanka down to a manageable score. Though we managed to restrict Sri Lanka to 251 in their fifty overs, that proved far too many in the end. When it was our turn to bat, the wicket had started doing all sorts of things. The ball was turning and holding up and batting was extremely difficult. Opening, I scored 65 but got out rather strangely to a ball from Sanath Jayasuriya. He was bowling left-arm orthodox spin and the ball hit my pad and rolled off to the on side. I thought there was a quick single and stepped out of the crease. Too late, I saw that the ball had stopped very close to Kaluwitharana, the keeper, and there was no way I could finish the run, but by then it was too late. He dislodged the stumps in a flash and I didn\u2019t bother waiting for the third umpire\u2019s decision because I knew I was out. It was a long and frustrating walk back to the pavilion and I could sense it would not be easy for the batsmen who followed. Sure enough, we soon lost wickets in a heap, handing Sri Lanka the game. The crowd, desperate for an Indian victory, grew increasingly restless and disrupted the game by throwing things onto the field. By then, however, the match was all over. Our World Cup dream lay shattered and there was a deathly silence in the dressing room. (Playing it My Way : My Autobiography - Sachin Tendulkar)",

He was bowling left-arm orthodox spin and the ball hit my pad and rolled off to the on side. I thought there was a quick single and stepped out of the crease. Too late, I saw that the ball had stopped very close to Kaluwitharana, the keeper, and there was no way I could finish the run, but by then it was too late. He dislodged the stumps in a flash and I didn\u2019t bother waiting for the third umpire\u2019s decision because I knew I was out. It was a long and frustrating walk back to the pavilion and I could sense it would not be easy for the batsmen who followed. Sure enough, we soon lost wickets in a heap, handing Sri Lanka the game. The crowd, desperate for an Indian victory, grew increasingly restless and disrupted the game by throwing things onto the field. By then, however, the match was all over.

                            "Read the following passage and answer the given subquestions.  We were due to play Sri Lanka in the semi-final at Eden Gardens on 13 March. We arrived in Kolkata two days before and the first thing that struck us on landing at the airport was the security. There were commandos everywhere and no fans were allowed near the hotel lobby. This was no ordinary match. Someone had mentioned to us that the surface at Eden Gardens had been relaid with soil brought over from Australia. The first look at the surface seemed to support this statement, with the pitch apparently hard and firm. In fact, it did look like a typical Australian wicket. On that basis, it was unanimously decided that we should field first if we won the toss, particularly because Sri Lanka had chased very well throughout the tournament. Their openers, Sanath Jayasuriya and Romesh Kaluwitharana, had been going for the bowling in the first fifteen overs and had given them fantastic starts in most matches. They had beaten us in the pool stage of the competition and it was important to take early wickets and put them under pressure. We won the toss and put the Sri Lankans in and got off to a great start, picking up Sanath for one and Kalu for zero. They both got out playing cut shots to third man, vindicating our belief that the wicket was hard and firm. It was only when I came on to bowl that I realized we had misread the wicket. The ball started to hold up and was stopping as it reached the batsmen. The top layer might have been firm enough, but immediately below the surface it was loose. It would clearly not last the full hundred overs and it became even more important to keep Sri Lanka down to a manageable score.

Their openers, Sanath Jayasuriya and Romesh Kaluwitharana, had been going for the bowling in the first fifteen overs and had given them fantastic starts in most matches. They had beaten us in the pool stage of the competition and it was important to take early wickets and put them under pressure. We won the toss and put the Sri Lankans in and got off to a great start, picking up Sanath for one and Kalu for zero. They both got out playing cut shots to third man, vindicating our belief that the wicket was hard and firm. It was only when I came on to bowl that I realized we had misread the wicket. The ball started to hold up and was stopping as it reached the batsmen. The top layer might have been firm enough, but immediately below the surface it was loose. It would clearly not last the full hundred overs and it became even more important to keep Sri Lanka down to a manageable score. Though we managed to restrict Sri Lanka to 251 in their fifty overs, that proved far too many in the end. When it was our turn to bat, the wicket had started doing all sorts of things. The ball was turning and holding up and batting was extremely difficult. Opening, I scored 65 but got out rather strangely to a ball from Sanath Jayasuriya. He was bowling left-arm orthodox spin and the ball hit my pad and rolled off to the on side. I thought there was a quick single and stepped out of the crease. Too late, I saw that the ball had stopped very close to Kaluwitharana, the keeper, and there was no way I could finish the run, but by then it was too late. He dislodged the stumps in a flash and I didn\u2019t bother waiting for the third umpire\u2019s decision because I knew I was out. It was a long and frustrating walk back to the pavilion and I could sense it would not be easy for the batsmen who followed. Sure enough, we soon lost wickets in a heap, handing Sri Lanka the game. The crowd, desperate for an Indian victory, grew increasingly restless and disrupted the game by throwing things onto the field. By then, however, the match was all over. Our World Cup dream lay shattered and there was a deathly silence in the dressing room. (Playing it My Way : My Autobiography - Sachin Tendulkar)"

We arrived in Kolkata two days before and the first thing that struck us on landing at the airport was the security. There were commandos everywhere and no fans were allowed near the hotel lobby. This was no ordinary match. Someone had mentioned to us that the surface at Eden Gardens had been relaid with soil brought over from Australia. The first look at the surface seemed to support this statement, with the pitch apparently hard and firm. In fact, it did look like a typical Australian wicket. On that basis, it was unanimously decided that we should field first if we won the toss, particularly because Sri Lanka had chased very well throughout the tournament. Their openers, Sanath Jayasuriya and Romesh Kaluwitharana, had been going for the bowling in the first fifteen overs and had given them fantastic starts in most matches. They had beaten us in the pool stage of the competition and it was important to take early wickets and put them under pressure. We won the toss and put the Sri Lankans in and got off to a great start, picking up Sanath for one and Kalu for zero. They both got out playing cut shots to third man, vindicating our belief that the wicket was hard and firm. It was only when I came on to bowl that I realized we had misread the wicket. The ball started to hold up and was stopping as it reached the batsmen. The top layer might have been firm enough, but immediately below the surface it was loose. It would clearly not last the full hundred overs and it became even more important to keep Sri Lanka down to a manageable score. Though we managed to restrict Sri Lanka to 251 in their fifty overs, that proved far too many in the end. When it was our turn to bat, the wicket had started doing all sorts of things. The ball was turning and holding up and batting was extremely difficult. Opening, I scored 65 but got out rather strangely to a ball from Sanath Jayasuriya. He was bowling left-arm orthodox spin and the ball hit my pad and rolled off to the on side. I thought there was a quick single and stepped out of the crease. Too late, I saw that the ball had stopped very close to Kaluwitharana, the keeper, and there was no way I could finish the run, but by then it was too late. He dislodged the stumps in a flash and I didn\u2019t bother waiting for the third umpire\u2019s decision because I knew I was out. It was a long and frustrating walk back to the pavilion and I could sense it would not be easy for the batsmen who followed. Sure enough, we soon lost wickets in a heap, handing Sri Lanka the game. The crowd, desperate for an Indian victory, grew increasingly restless and disrupted the game by throwing things onto the field. By then, however, the match was all over. Our World Cup dream lay shattered and there was a deathly silence in the dressing room. (Playing it My Way : My Autobiography - Sachin Tendulkar)",

We arrived in Kolkata two days before and the first thing that struck us on landing at the airport was the security. There were commandos everywhere and no fans were allowed near the hotel lobby. This was no ordinary match. Someone had mentioned to us that the surface at Eden Gardens had been relaid with soil brought over from Australia. The first look at the surface seemed to support this statement, with the pitch apparently hard and firm. In fact, it did look like a typical Australian wicket. On that basis, it was unanimously decided that we should field first if we won the toss, particularly because Sri Lanka had chased very well throughout the tournament. Their openers, Sanath Jayasuriya and Romesh Kaluwitharana, had been going for the bowling in the first fifteen overs and had given them fantastic starts in most matches. They had beaten us in the pool stage of the competition and it was important to take early wickets and put them under pressure. We won the toss and put the Sri Lankans in and got off to a great start, picking up Sanath for one and Kalu for zero. They both got out playing cut shots to third man, vindicating our belief that the wicket was hard and firm. It was only when I came on to bowl that I realized we had misread the wicket. The ball started to hold up and was stopping as it reached the batsmen. The top layer might have been firm enough, but immediately below the surface it was loose. It would clearly not last the full hundred overs and it became even more important to keep Sri Lanka down to a manageable score. Though we managed to restrict Sri Lanka to 251 in their fifty overs, that proved far too many in the end. When it was our turn to bat, the wicket had started doing all sorts of things. The ball was turning and holding up and batting was extremely difficult. Opening, I scored 65 but got out rather strangely to a ball from Sanath Jayasuriya. He was bowling left-arm orthodox spin and the ball hit my pad and rolled off to the on side. I thought there was a quick single and stepped out of the crease. Too late, I saw that the ball had stopped very close to Kaluwitharana, the keeper, and there was no way I could finish the run, but by then it was too late. He dislodged the stumps in a flash and I didn\u2019t bother waiting for the third umpire\u2019s decision because I knew I was out. It was a long and frustrating walk back to the pavilion and I could sense it would not be easy for the batsmen who followed. Sure enough, we soon lost wickets in a heap, handing Sri Lanka the game. The crowd, desperate for an Indian victory, grew increasingly restless and disrupted the game by throwing things onto the field. By then, however, the match was all over. Our World Cup dream lay shattered and there was a deathly silence in the dressing room. (Playing it My Way : My Autobiography - Sachin Tendulkar)",

                            "Read the following passage and answer the given subquestions.  We were due to play Sri Lanka in the semi-final at Eden Gardens on 13 March. We arrived in Kolkata two days before and the first thing that struck us on landing at the airport was the security. There were commandos everywhere and no fans were allowed near the hotel lobby. This was no ordinary match. Someone had mentioned to us that the surface at Eden Gardens had been relaid with soil brought over from Australia. The first look at the surface seemed to support this statement, with the pitch apparently hard and firm. In fact, it did look like a typical Australian wicket. On that basis, it was unanimously decided that we should field first if we won the toss, particularly because Sri Lanka had chased very well throughout the tournament. Their openers, Sanath Jayasuriya and Romesh Kaluwitharana, had been going for the bowling in the first fifteen overs and had given them fantastic starts in most matches. They had beaten us in the pool stage of the competition and it was important to take early wickets and put them under pressure. We won the toss and put the Sri Lankans in and got off to a great start, picking up Sanath for one and Kalu for zero. They both got out playing cut shots to third man, vindicating our belief that the wicket was hard and firm. It was only when I came on to bowl that I realized we had misread the wicket. The ball started to hold up and was stopping as it reached the batsmen. The top layer might have been firm enough, but immediately below the surface it was loose. It would clearly not last the full hundred overs and it became even more important to keep Sri Lanka down to a manageable score. Though we managed to restrict Sri Lanka to 251 in their fifty overs, that proved far too many in the end. When it was our turn to bat, the wicket had started doing all sorts of things. The ball was turning and holding up and batting was extremely difficult. Opening, I scored 65 but got out rather strangely to a ball from Sanath Jayasuriya. He was bowling left-arm orthodox spin and the ball hit my pad and rolled off to the on side. I thought there was a quick single and stepped out of the crease. Too late, I saw that the ball had stopped very close to Kaluwitharana, the keeper, and there was no way I could finish the run, but by then it was too late. He dislodged the stumps in a flash and I didn\u2019t bother waiting for the third umpire\u2019s decision because I knew I was out. It was a long and frustrating walk back to the pavilion and I could sense it would not be easy for the batsmen who followed. Sure enough, we soon lost wickets in a heap, handing Sri Lanka the game. The crowd, desperate for an Indian victory, grew increasingly restless and disrupted the game by throwing things onto the field. By then, however, the match was all over. Our World Cup dream lay shattered and there was a deathly silence in the dressing room. (Playing it My Way : My Autobiography - Sachin Tendulkar)"

We arrived in Kolkata two days before and the first thing that struck us on landing at the airport was the security. There were commandos everywhere and no fans were allowed near the hotel lobby. This was no ordinary match. Someone had mentioned to us that the surface at Eden Gardens had been relaid with soil brought over from Australia. The first look at the surface seemed to support this statement, with the pitch apparently hard and firm. In fact, it did look like a typical Australian wicket. On that basis, it was unanimously decided that we should field first if we won the toss, particularly because Sri Lanka had chased very well throughout the tournament. Their openers, Sanath Jayasuriya and Romesh Kaluwitharana, had been going for the bowling in the first fifteen overs and had given them fantastic starts in most matches. They had beaten us in the pool stage of the competition and it was important to take early wickets and put them under pressure. We won the toss and put the Sri Lankans in and got off to a great start, picking up Sanath for one and Kalu for zero. They both got out playing cut shots to third man, vindicating our belief that the wicket was hard and firm. It was only when I came on to bowl that I realized we had misread the wicket. The ball started to hold up and was stopping as it reached the batsmen. The top layer might have been firm enough, but immediately below the surface it was loose. It would clearly not last the full hundred overs and it became even more important to keep Sri Lanka down to a manageable score. Though we managed to restrict Sri Lanka to 251 in their fifty overs, that proved far too many in the end. When it was our turn to bat, the wicket had started doing all sorts of things. The ball was turning and holding up and batting was extremely difficult. Opening, I scored 65 but got out rather strangely to a ball from Sanath Jayasuriya. He was bowling left-arm orthodox spin and the ball hit my pad and rolled off to the on side. I thought there was a quick single and stepped out of the crease. Too late, I saw that the ball had stopped very close to Kaluwitharana, the keeper, and there was no way I could finish the run, but by then it was too late. He dislodged the stumps in a flash and I didn\u2019t bother waiting for the third umpire\u2019s decision because I knew I was out. It was a long and frustrating walk back to the pavilion and I could sense it would not be easy for the batsmen who followed. Sure enough, we soon lost wickets in a heap, handing Sri Lanka the game. The crowd, desperate for an Indian victory, grew increasingly restless and disrupted the game by throwing things onto the field. By then, however, the match was all over. Our World Cup dream lay shattered and there was a deathly silence in the dressing room. (Playing it My Way : My Autobiography - Sachin Tendulkar)",

They require motivation to perform and I try to provide them with as much motivation as I can. Simple tasks like talking to the team, listening to their problems and suggestions, and then trying to address them can be very helpful.  Interviewer: Yes, that sounds like what a good manager should do.  Candidate: As for my weakness\u2026 I do not think I have any. But I would be open to constructive criticism from my team or peers if they think they find a weakness in me.  Interviewer: That is good. Ability to own up to one's mistakes is the sign of a responsible individual.  Candidate: Thank you, sir.  Interviewer: At times, it so happens that we are too busy to check all the details of a project. Tell me about a time that this happened to you. When you found out that some errors had slipped through, what did you do?  Candidate: I had such an experience during one of our recent projects. As soon as I realized that there had been an oversight on the part of my team and that some errors had fallen through the cracks into our deliverables, I apologized to the client and to my reporting authority. We took responsibility as a team, distributed the workload involved in rectifying the error and ensured that each member had a clear grasp over his or her responsibility. We stayed committed to resolving the issue rather than on finding someone to pile the blame on. I believe that when faced with such an issue, our priority should be to work out a solution and to prevent the damage from escalating. Our swift action kept the damage to a minimum and we were able to use the opportunity to learn from our mistake, to identify the weak links in our communication and to prevent such errors in the future.  Interviewer: Your attitude towards crisis management is indeed commendable. How quickly would you be able to join our company?  Candidate: I do have to serve a notice period of 30 days if I put down my resignation.  Interviewer: Okay, and what are your expectations of salary?  Candidate: I would prefer it if it was according to industry standards.  Interviewer: Okay. Do you have any questions from your end?  Candidate: No. I do not have any questions.

As soon as I realized that there had been an oversight on the part of my team and that some errors had fallen through the cracks into our deliverables, I apologized to the client and to my reporting authority. We took responsibility as a team, distributed the workload involved in rectifying the error and ensured that each member had a clear grasp over his or her responsibility. We stayed committed to resolving the issue rather than on finding someone to pile the blame on. I believe that when faced with such an issue, our priority should be to work out a solution and to prevent the damage from escalating. Our swift action kept the damage to a minimum and we were able to use the opportunity to learn from our mistake, to identify the weak links in our communication and to prevent such errors in the future.  Interviewer: Your attitude towards crisis management is indeed commendable. How quickly would you be able to join our company?  Candidate: I do have to serve a notice period of 30 days if I put down my resignation.  Interviewer: Okay, and what are your expectations of salary?  Candidate: I would prefer it if it was according to industry standards.  Interviewer: Okay. Do you have any questions from your end?  Candidate: No. I do not have any questions.  Interviewer: Thank you for your time, John. We will get back to you shortly."

Candidate: I believe my greatest strength is that I am a team player. Obviously, I have to be, because handling a team is actually a big task. They require motivation to perform and I try to provide them with as much motivation as I can. Simple tasks like talking to the team, listening to their problems and suggestions, and then trying to address them can be very helpful.  Interviewer: Yes, that sounds like what a good manager should do.  Candidate: As for my weakness\u2026 I do not think I have any. But I would be open to constructive criticism from my team or peers if they think they find a weakness in me.  Interviewer: That is good. Ability to own up to one's mistakes is the sign of a responsible individual.  Candidate: Thank you, sir.  Interviewer: At times, it so happens that we are too busy to check all the details of a project. Tell me about a time that this happened to you. When you found out that some errors had slipped through, what did you do?  Candidate: I had such an experience during one of our recent projects. As soon as I realized that there had been an oversight on the part of my team and that some errors had fallen through the cracks into our deliverables, I apologized to the client and to my reporting authority. We took responsibility as a team, distributed the workload involved in rectifying the error and ensured that each member had a clear grasp over his or her responsibility. We stayed committed to resolving the issue rather than on finding someone to pile the blame on. I believe that when faced with such an issue, our priority should be to work out a solution and to prevent the damage from escalating. Our swift action kept the damage to a minimum and we were able to use the opportunity to learn from our mistake, to identify the weak links in our communication and to prevent such errors in the future.  Interviewer: Your attitude towards crisis management is indeed commendable. How quickly would you be able to join our company?  Candidate: I do have to serve a notice period of 30 days if I put down my resignation.  Interviewer: Okay, and what are your expectations of salary?  Candidate: I would prefer it if it was according to industry standards.  Interviewer: Okay. Do you have any questions from your end?  Candidate: No. I do not have any questions.

Candidate: I believe my greatest strength is that I am a team player. Obviously, I have to be, because handling a team is actually a big task. They require motivation to perform and I try to provide them with as much motivation as I can. Simple tasks like talking to the team, listening to their problems and suggestions, and then trying to address them can be very helpful.  Interviewer: Yes, that sounds like what a good manager should do.  Candidate: As for my weakness\u2026 I do not think I have any. But I would be open to constructive criticism from my team or peers if they think they find a weakness in me.  Interviewer: That is good. Ability to own up to one's mistakes is the sign of a responsible individual.  Candidate: Thank you, sir.  Interviewer: At times, it so happens that we are too busy to check all the details of a project. Tell me about a time that this happened to you. When you found out that some errors had slipped through, what did you do?  Candidate: I had such an experience during one of our recent projects. As soon as I realized that there had been an oversight on the part of my team and that some errors had fallen through the cracks into our deliverables, I apologized to the client and to my reporting authority. We took responsibility as a team, distributed the workload involved in rectifying the error and ensured that each member had a clear grasp over his or her responsibility. We stayed committed to resolving the issue rather than on finding someone to pile the blame on. I believe that when faced with such an issue, our priority should be to work out a solution and to prevent the damage from escalating. Our swift action kept the damage to a minimum and we were able to use the opportunity to learn from our mistake, to identify the weak links in our communication and to prevent such errors in the future.  Interviewer: Your attitude towards crisis management is indeed commendable. How quickly would you be able to join our company?  Candidate: I do have to serve a notice period of 30 days if I put down my resignation.  Interviewer: Okay, and what are your expectations of salary?  Candidate: I would prefer it if it was according to industry standards.  Interviewer: Okay. Do you have any questions from your end?  Candidate: No. I do not have any questions.

Candidate: I believe my greatest strength is that I am a team player. Obviously, I have to be, because handling a team is actually a big task. They require motivation to perform and I try to provide them with as much motivation as I can. Simple tasks like talking to the team, listening to their problems and suggestions, and then trying to address them can be very helpful.  Interviewer: Yes, that sounds like what a good manager should do.  Candidate: As for my weakness\u2026 I do not think I have any. But I would be open to constructive criticism from my team or peers if they think they find a weakness in me.  Interviewer: That is good. Ability to own up to one's mistakes is the sign of a responsible individual.  Candidate: Thank you, sir.  Interviewer: At times, it so happens that we are too busy to check all the details of a project. Tell me about a time that this happened to you. When you found out that some errors had slipped through, what did you do?  Candidate: I had such an experience during one of our recent projects. As soon as I realized that there had been an oversight on the part of my team and that some errors had fallen through the cracks into our deliverables, I apologized to the client and to my reporting authority. We took responsibility as a team, distributed the workload involved in rectifying the error and ensured that each member had a clear grasp over his or her responsibility. We stayed committed to resolving the issue rather than on finding someone to pile the blame on. I believe that when faced with such an issue, our priority should be to work out a solution and to prevent the damage from escalating. Our swift action kept the damage to a minimum and we were able to use the opportunity to learn from our mistake, to identify the weak links in our communication and to prevent such errors in the future.  Interviewer: Your attitude towards crisis management is indeed commendable. How quickly would you be able to join our company?  Candidate: I do have to serve a notice period of 30 days if I put down my resignation.  Interviewer: Okay, and what are your expectations of salary?  Candidate: I would prefer it if it was according to industry standards.  Interviewer: Okay. Do you have any questions from your end?  Candidate: No. I do not have any questions.

Candidate: I believe my greatest strength is that I am a team player. Obviously, I have to be, because handling a team is actually a big task. They require motivation to perform and I try to provide them with as much motivation as I can. Simple tasks like talking to the team, listening to their problems and suggestions, and then trying to address them can be very helpful.  Interviewer: Yes, that sounds like what a good manager should do.  Candidate: As for my weakness\u2026 I do not think I have any. But I would be open to constructive criticism from my team or peers if they think they find a weakness in me.  Interviewer: That is good. Ability to own up to one's mistakes is the sign of a responsible individual.  Candidate: Thank you, sir.  Interviewer: At times, it so happens that we are too busy to check all the details of a project. Tell me about a time that this happened to you. When you found out that some errors had slipped through, what did you do?  Candidate: I had such an experience during one of our recent projects. As soon as I realized that there had been an oversight on the part of my team and that some errors had fallen through the cracks into our deliverables, I apologized to the client and to my reporting authority. We took responsibility as a team, distributed the workload involved in rectifying the error and ensured that each member had a clear grasp over his or her responsibility. We stayed committed to resolving the issue rather than on finding someone to pile the blame on. I believe that when faced with such an issue, our priority should be to work out a solution and to prevent the damage from escalating. Our swift action kept the damage to a minimum and we were able to use the opportunity to learn from our mistake, to identify the weak links in our communication and to prevent such errors in the future.  Interviewer: Your attitude towards crisis management is indeed commendable. How quickly would you be able to join our company?  Candidate: I do have to serve a notice period of 30 days if I put down my resignation.  Interviewer: Okay, and what are your expectations of salary?  Candidate: I would prefer it if it was according to industry standards.  Interviewer: Okay. Do you have any questions from your end?  Candidate: No. I do not have any questions.

Candidate: I believe my greatest strength is that I am a team player. Obviously, I have to be, because handling a team is actually a big task. They require motivation to perform and I try to provide them with as much motivation as I can. Simple tasks like talking to the team, listening to their problems and suggestions, and then trying to address them can be very helpful.  Interviewer: Yes, that sounds like what a good manager should do.  Candidate: As for my weakness\u2026 I do not think I have any. But I would be open to constructive criticism from my team or peers if they think they find a weakness in me.  Interviewer: That is good. Ability to own up to one's mistakes is the sign of a responsible individual.  Candidate: Thank you, sir.  Interviewer: At times, it so happens that we are too busy to check all the details of a project. Tell me about a time that this happened to you. When you found out that some errors had slipped through, what did you do?  Candidate: I had such an experience during one of our recent projects. As soon as I realized that there had been an oversight on the part of my team and that some errors had fallen through the cracks into our deliverables, I apologized to the client and to my reporting authority. We took responsibility as a team, distributed the workload involved in rectifying the error and ensured that each member had a clear grasp over his or her responsibility. We stayed committed to resolving the issue rather than on finding someone to pile the blame on. I believe that when faced with such an issue, our priority should be to work out a solution and to prevent the damage from escalating. Our swift action kept the damage to a minimum and we were able to use the opportunity to learn from our mistake, to identify the weak links in our communication and to prevent such errors in the future.  Interviewer: Your attitude towards crisis management is indeed commendable. How quickly would you be able to join our company?  Candidate: I do have to serve a notice period of 30 days if I put down my resignation.  Interviewer: Okay, and what are your expectations of salary?  Candidate: I would prefer it if it was according to industry standards.  Interviewer: Okay. Do you have any questions from your end?  Candidate: No. I do not have any questions.

Candidate: I believe my greatest strength is that I am a team player. Obviously, I have to be, because handling a team is actually a big task. They require motivation to perform and I try to provide them with as much motivation as I can. Simple tasks like talking to the team, listening to their problems and suggestions, and then trying to address them can be very helpful.  Interviewer: Yes, that sounds like what a good manager should do.  Candidate: As for my weakness\u2026 I do not think I have any. But I would be open to constructive criticism from my team or peers if they think they find a weakness in me.  Interviewer: That is good. Ability to own up to one's mistakes is the sign of a responsible individual.  Candidate: Thank you, sir.  Interviewer: At times, it so happens that we are too busy to check all the details of a project. Tell me about a time that this happened to you. When you found out that some errors had slipped through, what did you do?  Candidate: I had such an experience during one of our recent projects. As soon as I realized that there had been an oversight on the part of my team and that some errors had fallen through the cracks into our deliverables, I apologized to the client and to my reporting authority. We took responsibility as a team, distributed the workload involved in rectifying the error and ensured that each member had a clear grasp over his or her responsibility. We stayed committed to resolving the issue rather than on finding someone to pile the blame on. I believe that when faced with such an issue, our priority should be to work out a solution and to prevent the damage from escalating. Our swift action kept the damage to a minimum and we were able to use the opportunity to learn from our mistake, to identify the weak links in our communication and to prevent such errors in the future.  Interviewer: Your attitude towards crisis management is indeed commendable. How quickly would you be able to join our company?  Candidate: I do have to serve a notice period of 30 days if I put down my resignation.  Interviewer: Okay, and what are your expectations of salary?  Candidate: I would prefer it if it was according to industry standards.  Interviewer: Okay. Do you have any questions from your end?  Candidate: No. I do not have any questions.  Interviewer: Thank you for your time, John. We will get back to you shortly.",

        "summary": "Here\u2019s a structured **summary of core topics, concepts, and principles** for the **\"Foundation Level: English II (Computer-Based Exam)\"** based on the provided question paper.\nThe exam focuses on **reading comprehension, grammar, vocabulary, word formation, sentence structure, and communication skills** (formal/informal, interviews, emails, etc.).\nNo equations or math-related content is present.\n\n---\n\n### **Core Topics & Concepts**\n#### **1. Reading Comprehension**\n   - **Key Skills**:\n     - Identifying main ideas, supporting details, and inferences.\n     - Understanding context (e.g., cricket match analysis, interview dialogues).\n     - Vocabulary in context (e.g., \"vindicate,\" \"constructive criticism\").\n   - **Passage Types**:\n     - Autobiographical (e.g., Sachin Tendulkar\u2019s match narrative).\n     - Interview transcripts (e.g., job interview with questions about strengths/weaknesses).\n     - Emails (e.g., informal meeting requests).\n\n#### **2. Grammar**\n   - **Sentence Transformation**:\n     - Active \u2192 Passive voice (e.g., \"The cook prepared a dish\" \u2192 \"A dish was prepared by the cook\").\n     - Direct \u2192 Indirect speech (e.g., \"Did you bring your camera?\" \u2192 \"She asked if he had brought his camera\").\n   - **Parts of Speech**:\n     - Adjectives (attributive: \"live water\"; viewpoint: \"historically\").\n     - Adverbs (degree: \"very much\"; contrast: \"after all\").\n     - Conjunctions (coordinating: \"and\"; subordinating: \"because\").\n   - **Modals**:\n     - Obligation (\"must\"), permission (\"may\"), ability (\"could\").\n   - **Question Tags**:\n     - Negative statements (e.g., \"She never had an advantage, **did she?**\").\n   - **Clauses**:\n     - Adjectival clauses (e.g., \"whose dedication was admired\").\n     - That-clauses as subjects/objects (e.g., \"That it grows in pots **is what makes it popular**\").\n\n   - **Sentence Types**:\n     - Simple (e.g., \"I must go now.\"), compound (e.g., \"Today is rainy **and** there is no sun.\"), complex (e.g., \"If they were corrupt, they would face consequences.\").\n\n#### **3. Vocabulary & Word Formation**\n   - **Processes**:\n     - **Back-formation**: \"resurrection\" \u2192 \"resurrect.\"\n     - **Blending**: \"video blog\" \u2192 \"vlog.\"\n     - **Derivation**: \"recreation\" + \"-al\" \u2192 \"recreational.\"\n     - **Compounding**: \"capital\" + \"intensive\" \u2192 \"capital-intensive.\"\n     - **Complex Clipping**: \"optical art\" \u2192 \"op art.\"\n     - **Inflection**: \"light\" + \"-est\" \u2192 \"lightest.\"\n   - **Contrast Words**:\n     - \"In spite of,\" \"after all,\" \"however.\"\n   - **Discourse Markers**:\n     - Conversation starters (e.g., \"To begin with...\").\n\n#### **4. Communication Skills**\n   - **Formal vs. Informal Language**:\n     - Emails: Salutations (\"Hi Ananya\"), closings (\"Best\"), body content (clear/main message).\n     - Polite requests (e.g., \"Would it be possible to share notes?\").\n   - **Interview Skills**:\n     - Strengths/weaknesses (e.g., \"I am a team player\").\n     - Crisis management (e.g., taking responsibility, solving problems).\n     - Salary/notice period negotiations.\n   - **Social Settings (Student-Teacher Interactions)**:\n     - Requesting extensions: \"Can you please extend the deadline?\"\n     - Clarifying doubts: \"Could you please repeat that?\"\n     - Raising concerns: \"I have concerns about the syllabus. Can we discuss them?\"\n\n#### **5. Literary Devices & Figures of Speech**\n   - **Metaphor**: \"Time is money.\"\n   - **Ambiguity Reduction**: Intonation in speech.\n\n#### **6. Conditional Sentences**\n   - **Types**:\n     - Zero: General truths (e.g., \"If you heat ice, it melts.\").\n     - First: Real possibilities (e.g., \"If it rains, we will cancel.\").\n     - Second: Hypotheticals (e.g., \"If they **were** corrupt, they **would** face consequences.\").\n     - Mixed: Combining past/unreal with present (e.g., \"If I had studied, I would know now.\").\n\n---\n\n### **Mermaid Knowledge Graphs**\n#### **Graph 1: Reading Comprehension & Vocabulary**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Reading Comprehension] --> B[Passage Types]\n    B --> B1[Autobiographical]\n    B --> B2[Interview Transcripts]\n    B --> B3[Emails]\n    A --> C[Vocabulary in Context]\n    C --> C1[vindicate: prove/justify]\n    C --> C2[constructive criticism: actionable feedback]\n    A --> D[Inferences]\n    D --> D1[Security at airport: high-stakes match]\n    D --> D2[Pitch misreading: loose soil beneath]\n```\n\n#### **Graph 2: Grammar**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Grammar] --> B[Sentence Transformation]\n    B --> B1[Active-Passive Voice]\n    B --> B2[Direct-Indirect Speech]\n    A --> C[Parts of Speech]\n    C --> C1[Adjectives: attributive/viewpoint]\n    C --> C2[Adverbs: degree/contrast]\n    C --> C3[Conjunctions: coordinating/subordinating]\n    A --> D[Modals]\n    D --> D1[Obligation: must]\n    D --> D2[Permission: may]\n    A --> E[Clauses]\n    E --> E1[Adjectival: whose dedication]\n    E --> E2[That-clauses: subject/object]\n```\n\n#### **Graph 3: Word Formation**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Word Formation] --> B[Back-formation]\n    B --> B1[resurrection \u2192 resurrect]\n    A --> C[Blending]\n    C --> C1[video blog \u2192 vlog]\n    A --> D[Derivation]\n    D --> D1[recreation + -al \u2192 recreational]\n    A --> E[Compounding]\n    E --> E1[capital + intensive \u2192 capital-intensive]\n    A --> F[Complex Clipping]\n    F --> F1[optical art \u2192 op art]\n```\n\n#### **Graph 4: Communication Skills**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Communication Skills] --> B[Formal vs. Informal]\n    B --> B1[Emails: salutations/closings]\n    B --> B2[Polite Requests]\n    A --> C[Interview Skills]\n    C --> C1[Strengths/Weaknesses]\n    C --> C2[Crisis Management]\n    A --> D[Social Settings]\n    D --> D1[Student-Teacher Interactions]\n    D --> D2[Deadline Extensions]\n```\n\n#### **Graph 5: Literary Devices & Conditionals**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Literary Devices] --> B[Metaphor]\n    B --> B1[Time is money]\n    A --> C[Conditionals]\n    C --> C1[Zero: general truths]\n    C --> C2[First: real possibilities]\n    C --> C3[Second: hypotheticals]\n    C --> C4[Mixed: past/unreal]\n```\n\n---\n### **Key Takeaways for Exam Preparation**\n1. **Reading Comprehension**:\n   - Practice summarizing passages and identifying implicit meanings.\n   - Focus on **contextual vocabulary** (e.g., \"vindicate,\" \"misread\").\n\n2. **Grammar**:\n   - Master **active/passive voice**, **direct/indirect speech**, and **clause types**.\n   - Review **modals** (must/may/could) and **question tags**.\n\n3. **Word Formation**:\n   - Memorize processes like **back-formation**, **blending**, and **derivation** with examples.\n\n4. **Communication**:\n   - Differentiate **formal/informal language** in emails and interviews.\n   - Practice **polite requests** and **interview responses** (strengths/weaknesses, crisis handling).\n\n5. **Conditionals**:\n   - Understand the **structure and use** of zero/first/second/mixed conditionals.\n\n6. **Literary Devices**:\n   - Recognize **metaphors** and **discourse markers** in sentences.\n\n---\nThis summary covers **all question types** in the paper.
