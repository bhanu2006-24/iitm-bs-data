We arrived in Kolkata two days before and the first thing that struck us on landing at the airport was the security. There were commandos everywhere and no fans were allowed near the hotel lobby. This was no ordinary match. Someone had mentioned to us that the surface at Eden Gardens had been relaid with soil brought over from Australia. The first look at the surface seemed to support this statement, with the pitch apparently hard and firm. In fact, it did look like a typical Australian wicket. On that basis, it was unanimously decided that we should field first if we won the toss, particularly because Sri Lanka had chased very well throughout the tournament. Their openers, Sanath Jayasuriya and Romesh Kaluwitharana, had been going for the bowling in the first fifteen overs and had given them fantastic starts in most matches. They had beaten us in the pool stage of the competition and it was important to take early wickets and put them under pressure. We won the toss and put the Sri Lankans in and got off to a great start, picking up Sanath for one and Kalu for zero. They both got out playing cut shots to third man, vindicating our belief that the wicket was hard and firm. It was only when I came on to bowl that I realized we had misread the wicket. The ball started to hold up and was stopping as it reached the batsmen. The top layer might have been firm enough, but immediately below the surface it was loose. It would clearly not last the full hundred overs and it became even more important to keep Sri Lanka down to a manageable score. Though we managed to restrict Sri Lanka to 251 in their fifty overs, that proved far too many in the end. When it was our turn to bat, the wicket had started doing all sorts of things. The ball was turning and holding up and batting was extremely difficult. Opening, I scored 65 but got out rather strangely to a ball from Sanath Jayasuriya. He was bowling left-arm orthodox spin and the ball hit my pad and rolled off to the on side. I thought there was a quick single and stepped out of the crease. Too late, I saw that the ball had stopped very close to Kaluwitharana, the keeper, and there was no way I could finish the run, but by then it was too late. He dislodged the stumps in a flash and I didn\u2019t bother waiting for the third umpire\u2019s decision because I knew I was out. It was a long and frustrating walk back to the pavilion and I could sense it would not be easy for the batsmen who followed. Sure enough, we soon lost wickets in a heap, handing Sri Lanka the game. The crowd, desperate for an Indian victory, grew increasingly restless and disrupted the game by throwing things onto the field. By then, however, the match was all over. Our World Cup dream lay shattered and there was a deathly silence in the dressing room. (Playing it My Way : My Autobiography - Sachin Tendulkar)",

We arrived in Kolkata two days before and the first thing that struck us on landing at the airport was the security. There were commandos everywhere and no fans were allowed near the hotel lobby. This was no ordinary match. Someone had mentioned to us that the surface at Eden Gardens had been relaid with soil brought over from Australia. The first look at the surface seemed to support this statement, with the pitch apparently hard and firm. In fact, it did look like a typical Australian wicket. On that basis, it was unanimously decided that we should field first if we won the toss, particularly because Sri Lanka had chased very well throughout the tournament. Their openers, Sanath Jayasuriya and Romesh Kaluwitharana, had been going for the bowling in the first fifteen overs and had given them fantastic starts in most matches. They had beaten us in the pool stage of the competition and it was important to take early wickets and put them under pressure. We won the toss and put the Sri Lankans in and got off to a great start, picking up Sanath for one and Kalu for zero. They both got out playing cut shots to third man, vindicating our belief that the wicket was hard and firm. It was only when I came on to bowl that I realized we had misread the wicket. The ball started to hold up and was stopping as it reached the batsmen. The top layer might have been firm enough, but immediately below the surface it was loose. It would clearly not last the full hundred overs and it became even more important to keep Sri Lanka down to a manageable score. Though we managed to restrict Sri Lanka to 251 in their fifty overs, that proved far too many in the end. When it was our turn to bat, the wicket had started doing all sorts of things. The ball was turning and holding up and batting was extremely difficult. Opening, I scored 65 but got out rather strangely to a ball from Sanath Jayasuriya. He was bowling left-arm orthodox spin and the ball hit my pad and rolled off to the on side. I thought there was a quick single and stepped out of the crease. Too late, I saw that the ball had stopped very close to Kaluwitharana, the keeper, and there was no way I could finish the run, but by then it was too late. He dislodged the stumps in a flash and I didn\u2019t bother waiting for the third umpire\u2019s decision because I knew I was out. It was a long and frustrating walk back to the pavilion and I could sense it would not be easy for the batsmen who followed. Sure enough, we soon lost wickets in a heap, handing Sri Lanka the game. The crowd, desperate for an Indian victory, grew increasingly restless and disrupted the game by throwing things onto the field. By then, however, the match was all over. Our World Cup dream lay shattered and there was a deathly silence in the dressing room. (Playing it My Way : My Autobiography - Sachin Tendulkar)",

He was bowling left-arm orthodox spin and the ball hit my pad and rolled off to the on side. I thought there was a quick single and stepped out of the crease. Too late, I saw that the ball had stopped very close to Kaluwitharana, the keeper, and there was no way I could finish the run, but by then it was too late. He dislodged the stumps in a flash and I didn\u2019t bother waiting for the third umpire\u2019s decision because I knew I was out. It was a long and frustrating walk back to the pavilion and I could sense it would not be easy for the batsmen who followed. Sure enough, we soon lost wickets in a heap, handing Sri Lanka the game. The crowd, desperate for an Indian victory, grew increasingly restless and disrupted the game by throwing things onto the field. By then, however, the match was all over.

                            "Read the following passage and answer the given subquestions.  We were due to play Sri Lanka in the semi-final at Eden Gardens on 13 March. We arrived in Kolkata two days before and the first thing that struck us on landing at the airport was the security. There were commandos everywhere and no fans were allowed near the hotel lobby. This was no ordinary match. Someone had mentioned to us that the surface at Eden Gardens had been relaid with soil brought over from Australia. The first look at the surface seemed to support this statement, with the pitch apparently hard and firm. In fact, it did look like a typical Australian wicket. On that basis, it was unanimously decided that we should field first if we won the toss, particularly because Sri Lanka had chased very well throughout the tournament. Their openers, Sanath Jayasuriya and Romesh Kaluwitharana, had been going for the bowling in the first fifteen overs and had given them fantastic starts in most matches. They had beaten us in the pool stage of the competition and it was important to take early wickets and put them under pressure. We won the toss and put the Sri Lankans in and got off to a great start, picking up Sanath for one and Kalu for zero. They both got out playing cut shots to third man, vindicating our belief that the wicket was hard and firm. It was only when I came on to bowl that I realized we had misread the wicket. The ball started to hold up and was stopping as it reached the batsmen. The top layer might have been firm enough, but immediately below the surface it was loose. It would clearly not last the full hundred overs and it became even more important to keep Sri Lanka down to a manageable score. Though we managed to restrict Sri Lanka to 251 in their fifty overs, that proved far too many in the end. When it was our turn to bat, the wicket had started doing all sorts of things.

Their openers, Sanath Jayasuriya and Romesh Kaluwitharana, had been going for the bowling in the first fifteen overs and had given them fantastic starts in most matches. They had beaten us in the pool stage of the competition and it was important to take early wickets and put them under pressure. We won the toss and put the Sri Lankans in and got off to a great start, picking up Sanath for one and Kalu for zero. They both got out playing cut shots to third man, vindicating our belief that the wicket was hard and firm. It was only when I came on to bowl that I realized we had misread the wicket. The ball started to hold up and was stopping as it reached the batsmen. The top layer might have been firm enough, but immediately below the surface it was loose. It would clearly not last the full hundred overs and it became even more important to keep Sri Lanka down to a manageable score. Though we managed to restrict Sri Lanka to 251 in their fifty overs, that proved far too many in the end. When it was our turn to bat, the wicket had started doing all sorts of things. The ball was turning and holding up and batting was extremely difficult. Opening, I scored 65 but got out rather strangely to a ball from Sanath Jayasuriya. He was bowling left-arm orthodox spin and the ball hit my pad and rolled off to the on side. I thought there was a quick single and stepped out of the crease. Too late, I saw that the ball had stopped very close to Kaluwitharana, the keeper, and there was no way I could finish the run, but by then it was too late. He dislodged the stumps in a flash and I didn\u2019t bother waiting for the third umpire\u2019s decision because I knew I was out. It was a long and frustrating walk back to the pavilion and I could sense it would not be easy for the batsmen who followed. Sure enough, we soon lost wickets in a heap, handing Sri Lanka the game. The crowd, desperate for an Indian victory, grew increasingly restless and disrupted the game by throwing things onto the field. By then, however, the match was all over. Our World Cup dream lay shattered and there was a deathly silence in the dressing room. (Playing it My Way : My Autobiography - Sachin Tendulkar)"

We arrived in Kolkata two days before and the first thing that struck us on landing at the airport was the security. There were commandos everywhere and no fans were allowed near the hotel lobby. This was no ordinary match. Someone had mentioned to us that the surface at Eden Gardens had been relaid with soil brought over from Australia. The first look at the surface seemed to support this statement, with the pitch apparently hard and firm. In fact, it did look like a typical Australian wicket. On that basis, it was unanimously decided that we should field first if we won the toss, particularly because Sri Lanka had chased very well throughout the tournament. Their openers, Sanath Jayasuriya and Romesh Kaluwitharana, had been going for the bowling in the first fifteen overs and had given them fantastic starts in most matches. They had beaten us in the pool stage of the competition and it was important to take early wickets and put them under pressure. We won the toss and put the Sri Lankans in and got off to a great start, picking up Sanath for one and Kalu for zero. They both got out playing cut shots to third man, vindicating our belief that the wicket was hard and firm. It was only when I came on to bowl that I realized we had misread the wicket. The ball started to hold up and was stopping as it reached the batsmen. The top layer might have been firm enough, but immediately below the surface it was loose. It would clearly not last the full hundred overs and it became even more important to keep Sri Lanka down to a manageable score. Though we managed to restrict Sri Lanka to 251 in their fifty overs, that proved far too many in the end. When it was our turn to bat, the wicket had started doing all sorts of things. The ball was turning and holding up and batting was extremely difficult. Opening, I scored 65 but got out rather strangely to a ball from Sanath Jayasuriya. He was bowling left-arm orthodox spin and the ball hit my pad and rolled off to the on side. I thought there was a quick single and stepped out of the crease. Too late, I saw that the ball had stopped very close to Kaluwitharana, the keeper, and there was no way I could finish the run, but by then it was too late. He dislodged the stumps in a flash and I didn\u2019t bother waiting for the third umpire\u2019s decision because I knew I was out. It was a long and frustrating walk back to the pavilion and I could sense it would not be easy for the batsmen who followed. Sure enough, we soon lost wickets in a heap, handing Sri Lanka the game. The crowd, desperate for an Indian victory, grew increasingly restless and disrupted the game by throwing things onto the field. By then, however, the match was all over. Our World Cup dream lay shattered and there was a deathly silence in the dressing room. (Playing it My Way : My Autobiography - Sachin Tendulkar)",

We arrived in Kolkata two days before and the first thing that struck us on landing at the airport was the security. There were commandos everywhere and no fans were allowed near the hotel lobby. This was no ordinary match. Someone had mentioned to us that the surface at Eden Gardens had been relaid with soil brought over from Australia. The first look at the surface seemed to support this statement, with the pitch apparently hard and firm. In fact, it did look like a typical Australian wicket. On that basis, it was unanimously decided that we should field first if we won the toss, particularly because Sri Lanka had chased very well throughout the tournament. Their openers, Sanath Jayasuriya and Romesh Kaluwitharana, had been going for the bowling in the first fifteen overs and had given them fantastic starts in most matches. They had beaten us in the pool stage of the competition and it was important to take early wickets and put them under pressure. We won the toss and put the Sri Lankans in and got off to a great start, picking up Sanath for one and Kalu for zero. They both got out playing cut shots to third man, vindicating our belief that the wicket was hard and firm. It was only when I came on to bowl that I realized we had misread the wicket. The ball started to hold up and was stopping as it reached the batsmen. The top layer might have been firm enough, but immediately below the surface it was loose. It would clearly not last the full hundred overs and it became even more important to keep Sri Lanka down to a manageable score. Though we managed to restrict Sri Lanka to 251 in their fifty overs, that proved far too many in the end. When it was our turn to bat, the wicket had started doing all sorts of things. The ball was turning and holding up and batting was extremely difficult. Opening, I scored 65 but got out rather strangely to a ball from Sanath Jayasuriya. He was bowling left-arm orthodox spin and the ball hit my pad and rolled off to the on side. I thought there was a quick single and stepped out of the crease. Too late, I saw that the ball had stopped very close to Kaluwitharana, the keeper, and there was no way I could finish the run, but by then it was too late. He dislodged the stumps in a flash and I didn\u2019t bother waiting for the third umpire\u2019s decision because I knew I was out. It was a long and frustrating walk back to the pavilion and I could sense it would not be easy for the batsmen who followed. Sure enough, we soon lost wickets in a heap, handing Sri Lanka the game. The crowd, desperate for an Indian victory, grew increasingly restless and disrupted the game by throwing things onto the field. By then, however, the match was all over. Our World Cup dream lay shattered and there was a deathly silence in the dressing room. (Playing it My Way : My Autobiography - Sachin Tendulkar)",

                            "Read the following passage and answer the given subquestions.  We were due to play Sri Lanka in the semi-final at Eden Gardens on 13 March. We arrived in Kolkata two days before and the first thing that struck us on landing at the airport was the security. There were commandos everywhere and no fans were allowed near the hotel lobby. This was no ordinary match. Someone had mentioned to us that the surface at Eden Gardens had been relaid with soil brought over from Australia. The first look at the surface seemed to support this statement, with the pitch apparently hard and firm. In fact, it did look like a typical Australian wicket. On that basis, it was unanimously decided that we should field first if we won the toss, particularly because Sri Lanka had chased very well throughout the tournament. Their openers, Sanath Jayasuriya and Romesh Kaluwitharana, had been going for the bowling in the first fifteen overs and had given them fantastic starts in most matches. They had beaten us in the pool stage of the competition and it was important to take early wickets and put them under pressure. We won the toss and put the Sri Lankans in and got off to a great start, picking up Sanath for one and Kalu for zero. They both got out playing cut shots to third man, vindicating our belief that the wicket was hard and firm. It was only when I came on to bowl that I realized we had misread the wicket. The ball started to hold up and was stopping as it reached the batsmen. The top layer might have been firm enough, but immediately below the surface it was loose. It would clearly not last the full hundred overs and it became even more important to keep Sri Lanka down to a manageable score. Though we managed to restrict Sri Lanka to 251 in their fifty overs, that proved far too many in the end. When it was our turn to bat, the wicket had started doing all sorts of things. The ball was turning and holding up and batting was extremely difficult. Opening, I scored 65 but got out rather strangely to a ball from Sanath Jayasuriya. He was bowling left-arm orthodox spin and the ball hit my pad and rolled off to the on side. I thought there was a quick single and stepped out of the crease. Too late, I saw that the ball had stopped very close to Kaluwitharana, the keeper, and there was no way I could finish the run, but by then it was too late. He dislodged the stumps in a flash and I didn\u2019t bother waiting for the third umpire\u2019s decision because I knew I was out. It was a long and frustrating walk back to the pavilion and I could sense it would not be easy for the batsmen who followed. Sure enough, we soon lost wickets in a heap, handing Sri Lanka the game. The crowd, desperate for an Indian victory, grew increasingly restless and disrupted the game by throwing things onto the field. By then, however, the match was all over. Our World Cup dream lay shattered and there was a deathly silence in the dressing room. (Playing it My Way : My Autobiography - Sachin Tendulkar)"

We arrived in Kolkata two days before and the first thing that struck us on landing at the airport was the security. There were commandos everywhere and no fans were allowed near the hotel lobby. This was no ordinary match. Someone had mentioned to us that the surface at Eden Gardens had been relaid with soil brought over from Australia. The first look at the surface seemed to support this statement, with the pitch apparently hard and firm. In fact, it did look like a typical Australian wicket. On that basis, it was unanimously decided that we should field first if we won the toss, particularly because Sri Lanka had chased very well throughout the tournament. Their openers, Sanath Jayasuriya and Romesh Kaluwitharana, had been going for the bowling in the first fifteen overs and had given them fantastic starts in most matches. They had beaten us in the pool stage of the competition and it was important to take early wickets and put them under pressure. We won the toss and put the Sri Lankans in and got off to a great start, picking up Sanath for one and Kalu for zero. They both got out playing cut shots to third man, vindicating our belief that the wicket was hard and firm. It was only when I came on to bowl that I realized we had misread the wicket. The ball started to hold up and was stopping as it reached the batsmen. The top layer might have been firm enough, but immediately below the surface it was loose. It would clearly not last the full hundred overs and it became even more important to keep Sri Lanka down to a manageable score. Though we managed to restrict Sri Lanka to 251 in their fifty overs, that proved far too many in the end. When it was our turn to bat, the wicket had started doing all sorts of things. The ball was turning and holding up and batting was extremely difficult. Opening, I scored 65 but got out rather strangely to a ball from Sanath Jayasuriya. He was bowling left-arm orthodox spin and the ball hit my pad and rolled off to the on side. I thought there was a quick single and stepped out of the crease. Too late, I saw that the ball had stopped very close to Kaluwitharana, the keeper, and there was no way I could finish the run, but by then it was too late. He dislodged the stumps in a flash and I didn\u2019t bother waiting for the third umpire\u2019s decision because I knew I was out. It was a long and frustrating walk back to the pavilion and I could sense it would not be easy for the batsmen who followed. Sure enough, we soon lost wickets in a heap, handing Sri Lanka the game. The crowd, desperate for an Indian victory, grew increasingly restless and disrupted the game by throwing things onto the field. By then, however, the match was all over. Our World Cup dream lay shattered and there was a deathly silence in the dressing room. (Playing it My Way : My Autobiography - Sachin Tendulkar)",

They require motivation to perform and I try to provide them with as much motivation as I can. Simple tasks like talking to the team, listening to their problems and suggestions, and then trying to address them can be very helpful.  Interviewer: Yes, that sounds like what a good manager should do.  Candidate: As for my weakness\u2026 I do not think I have any. But I would be open to constructive criticism from my team or peers if they think they find a weakness in me.  Interviewer: That is good. Ability to own up to one's mistakes is the sign of a responsible individual.  Candidate: Thank you, sir.  Interviewer: At times, it so happens that we are too busy to check all the details of a project. Tell me about a time that this happened to you. When you found out that some errors had slipped through, what did you do?  Candidate: I had such an experience during one of our recent projects. As soon as I realized that there had been an oversight on the part of my team and that some errors had fallen through the cracks into our deliverables, I apologized to the client and to my reporting authority. We took responsibility as a team, distributed the workload involved in rectifying the error and ensured that each member had a clear grasp over his or her responsibility. We stayed committed to resolving the issue rather than on finding someone to pile the blame on. I believe that when faced with such an issue, our priority should be to work out a solution and to prevent the damage from escalating. Our swift action kept the damage to a minimum and we were able to use the opportunity to learn from our mistake, to identify the weak links in our communication and to prevent such errors in the future.  Interviewer: Your attitude towards crisis management is indeed commendable. How quickly would you be able to join our company?  Candidate: I do have to serve a notice period of 30 days if I put down my resignation.  Interviewer: Okay, and what are your expectations of salary?  Candidate: I would prefer it if it was according to industry standards.  Interviewer: Okay. Do you have any questions from your end?  Candidate: No. I do not have any questions.

As soon as I realized that there had been an oversight on the part of my team and that some errors had fallen through the cracks into our deliverables, I apologized to the client and to my reporting authority. We took responsibility as a team, distributed the workload involved in rectifying the error and ensured that each member had a clear grasp over his or her responsibility. We stayed committed to resolving the issue rather than on finding someone to pile the blame on. I believe that when faced with such an issue, our priority should be to work out a solution and to prevent the damage from escalating. Our swift action kept the damage to a minimum and we were able to use the opportunity to learn from our mistake, to identify the weak links in our communication and to prevent such errors in the future.  Interviewer: Your attitude towards crisis management is indeed commendable. How quickly would you be able to join our company?  Candidate: I do have to serve a notice period of 30 days if I put down my resignation.  Interviewer: Okay, and what are your expectations of salary?  Candidate: I would prefer it if it was according to industry standards.  Interviewer: Okay. Do you have any questions from your end?  Candidate: No. I do not have any questions.  Interviewer: Thank you for your time, John. We will get back to you shortly."

Candidate: I believe my greatest strength is that I am a team player. Obviously, I have to be, because handling a team is actually a big task. They require motivation to perform and I try to provide them with as much motivation as I can. Simple tasks like talking to the team, listening to their problems and suggestions, and then trying to address them can be very helpful.  Interviewer: Yes, that sounds like what a good manager should do.  Candidate: As for my weakness\u2026 I do not think I have any. But I would be open to constructive criticism from my team or peers if they think they find a weakness in me.  Interviewer: That is good. Ability to own up to one's mistakes is the sign of a responsible individual.  Candidate: Thank you, sir.  Interviewer: At times, it so happens that we are too busy to check all the details of a project. Tell me about a time that this happened to you. When you found out that some errors had slipped through, what did you do?  Candidate: I had such an experience during one of our recent projects. As soon as I realized that there had been an oversight on the part of my team and that some errors had fallen through the cracks into our deliverables, I apologized to the client and to my reporting authority. We took responsibility as a team, distributed the workload involved in rectifying the error and ensured that each member had a clear grasp over his or her responsibility. We stayed committed to resolving the issue rather than on finding someone to pile the blame on. I believe that when faced with such an issue, our priority should be to work out a solution and to prevent the damage from escalating. Our swift action kept the damage to a minimum and we were able to use the opportunity to learn from our mistake, to identify the weak links in our communication and to prevent such errors in the future.  Interviewer: Your attitude towards crisis management is indeed commendable. How quickly would you be able to join our company?  Candidate: I do have to serve a notice period of 30 days if I put down my resignation.  Interviewer: Okay, and what are your expectations of salary?  Candidate: I would prefer it if it was according to industry standards.  Interviewer: Okay. Do you have any questions from your end?  Candidate: No. I do not have any questions.

Candidate: I believe my greatest strength is that I am a team player. Obviously, I have to be, because handling a team is actually a big task. They require motivation to perform and I try to provide them with as much motivation as I can. Simple tasks like talking to the team, listening to their problems and suggestions, and then trying to address them can be very helpful.  Interviewer: Yes, that sounds like what a good manager should do.  Candidate: As for my weakness\u2026 I do not think I have any. But I would be open to constructive criticism from my team or peers if they think they find a weakness in me.  Interviewer: That is good. Ability to own up to one's mistakes is the sign of a responsible individual.  Candidate: Thank you, sir.  Interviewer: At times, it so happens that we are too busy to check all the details of a project. Tell me about a time that this happened to you. When you found out that some errors had slipped through, what did you do?  Candidate: I had such an experience during one of our recent projects. As soon as I realized that there had been an oversight on the part of my team and that some errors had fallen through the cracks into our deliverables, I apologized to the client and to my reporting authority. We took responsibility as a team, distributed the workload involved in rectifying the error and ensured that each member had a clear grasp over his or her responsibility. We stayed committed to resolving the issue rather than on finding someone to pile the blame on. I believe that when faced with such an issue, our priority should be to work out a solution and to prevent the damage from escalating. Our swift action kept the damage to a minimum and we were able to use the opportunity to learn from our mistake, to identify the weak links in our communication and to prevent such errors in the future.  Interviewer: Your attitude towards crisis management is indeed commendable. How quickly would you be able to join our company?  Candidate: I do have to serve a notice period of 30 days if I put down my resignation.  Interviewer: Okay, and what are your expectations of salary?  Candidate: I would prefer it if it was according to industry standards.  Interviewer: Okay. Do you have any questions from your end?  Candidate: No. I do not have any questions.

Candidate: I believe my greatest strength is that I am a team player. Obviously, I have to be, because handling a team is actually a big task. They require motivation to perform and I try to provide them with as much motivation as I can. Simple tasks like talking to the team, listening to their problems and suggestions, and then trying to address them can be very helpful.  Interviewer: Yes, that sounds like what a good manager should do.  Candidate: As for my weakness\u2026 I do not think I have any. But I would be open to constructive criticism from my team or peers if they think they find a weakness in me.  Interviewer: That is good. Ability to own up to one's mistakes is the sign of a responsible individual.  Candidate: Thank you, sir.  Interviewer: At times, it so happens that we are too busy to check all the details of a project. Tell me about a time that this happened to you. When you found out that some errors had slipped through, what did you do?  Candidate: I had such an experience during one of our recent projects. As soon as I realized that there had been an oversight on the part of my team and that some errors had fallen through the cracks into our deliverables, I apologized to the client and to my reporting authority. We took responsibility as a team, distributed the workload involved in rectifying the error and ensured that each member had a clear grasp over his or her responsibility. We stayed committed to resolving the issue rather than on finding someone to pile the blame on. I believe that when faced with such an issue, our priority should be to work out a solution and to prevent the damage from escalating. Our swift action kept the damage to a minimum and we were able to use the opportunity to learn from our mistake, to identify the weak links in our communication and to prevent such errors in the future.  Interviewer: Your attitude towards crisis management is indeed commendable. How quickly would you be able to join our company?  Candidate: I do have to serve a notice period of 30 days if I put down my resignation.  Interviewer: Okay, and what are your expectations of salary?  Candidate: I would prefer it if it was according to industry standards.  Interviewer: Okay. Do you have any questions from your end?  Candidate: No. I do not have any questions.

Candidate: I believe my greatest strength is that I am a team player. Obviously, I have to be, because handling a team is actually a big task. They require motivation to perform and I try to provide them with as much motivation as I can. Simple tasks like talking to the team, listening to their problems and suggestions, and then trying to address them can be very helpful.  Interviewer: Yes, that sounds like what a good manager should do.  Candidate: As for my weakness\u2026 I do not think I have any. But I would be open to constructive criticism from my team or peers if they think they find a weakness in me.  Interviewer: That is good. Ability to own up to one's mistakes is the sign of a responsible individual.  Candidate: Thank you, sir.  Interviewer: At times, it so happens that we are too busy to check all the details of a project. Tell me about a time that this happened to you. When you found out that some errors had slipped through, what did you do?  Candidate: I had such an experience during one of our recent projects. As soon as I realized that there had been an oversight on the part of my team and that some errors had fallen through the cracks into our deliverables, I apologized to the client and to my reporting authority. We took responsibility as a team, distributed the workload involved in rectifying the error and ensured that each member had a clear grasp over his or her responsibility. We stayed committed to resolving the issue rather than on finding someone to pile the blame on. I believe that when faced with such an issue, our priority should be to work out a solution and to prevent the damage from escalating. Our swift action kept the damage to a minimum and we were able to use the opportunity to learn from our mistake, to identify the weak links in our communication and to prevent such errors in the future.  Interviewer: Your attitude towards crisis management is indeed commendable. How quickly would you be able to join our company?  Candidate: I do have to serve a notice period of 30 days if I put down my resignation.  Interviewer: Okay, and what are your expectations of salary?  Candidate: I would prefer it if it was according to industry standards.  Interviewer: Okay. Do you have any questions from your end?  Candidate: No. I do not have any questions.

Candidate: I believe my greatest strength is that I am a team player. Obviously, I have to be, because handling a team is actually a big task. They require motivation to perform and I try to provide them with as much motivation as I can. Simple tasks like talking to the team, listening to their problems and suggestions, and then trying to address them can be very helpful.  Interviewer: Yes, that sounds like what a good manager should do.  Candidate: As for my weakness\u2026 I do not think I have any. But I would be open to constructive criticism from my team or peers if they think they find a weakness in me.  Interviewer: That is good. Ability to own up to one's mistakes is the sign of a responsible individual.  Candidate: Thank you, sir.  Interviewer: At times, it so happens that we are too busy to check all the details of a project. Tell me about a time that this happened to you. When you found out that some errors had slipped through, what did you do?  Candidate: I had such an experience during one of our recent projects. As soon as I realized that there had been an oversight on the part of my team and that some errors had fallen through the cracks into our deliverables, I apologized to the client and to my reporting authority. We took responsibility as a team, distributed the workload involved in rectifying the error and ensured that each member had a clear grasp over his or her responsibility. We stayed committed to resolving the issue rather than on finding someone to pile the blame on. I believe that when faced with such an issue, our priority should be to work out a solution and to prevent the damage from escalating. Our swift action kept the damage to a minimum and we were able to use the opportunity to learn from our mistake, to identify the weak links in our communication and to prevent such errors in the future.  Interviewer: Your attitude towards crisis management is indeed commendable. How quickly would you be able to join our company?  Candidate: I do have to serve a notice period of 30 days if I put down my resignation.  Interviewer: Okay, and what are your expectations of salary?  Candidate: I would prefer it if it was according to industry standards.  Interviewer: Okay. Do you have any questions from your end?  Candidate: No. I do not have any questions.

Candidate: I believe my greatest strength is that I am a team player. Obviously, I have to be, because handling a team is actually a big task. They require motivation to perform and I try to provide them with as much motivation as I can. Simple tasks like talking to the team, listening to their problems and suggestions, and then trying to address them can be very helpful.  Interviewer: Yes, that sounds like what a good manager should do.  Candidate: As for my weakness\u2026 I do not think I have any. But I would be open to constructive criticism from my team or peers if they think they find a weakness in me.  Interviewer: That is good. Ability to own up to one's mistakes is the sign of a responsible individual.  Candidate: Thank you, sir.  Interviewer: At times, it so happens that we are too busy to check all the details of a project. Tell me about a time that this happened to you. When you found out that some errors had slipped through, what did you do?  Candidate: I had such an experience during one of our recent projects. As soon as I realized that there had been an oversight on the part of my team and that some errors had fallen through the cracks into our deliverables, I apologized to the client and to my reporting authority. We took responsibility as a team, distributed the workload involved in rectifying the error and ensured that each member had a clear grasp over his or her responsibility. We stayed committed to resolving the issue rather than on finding someone to pile the blame on. I believe that when faced with such an issue, our priority should be to work out a solution and to prevent the damage from escalating. Our swift action kept the damage to a minimum and we were able to use the opportunity to learn from our mistake, to identify the weak links in our communication and to prevent such errors in the future.  Interviewer: Your attitude towards crisis management is indeed commendable. How quickly would you be able to join our company?  Candidate: I do have to serve a notice period of 30 days if I put down my resignation.  Interviewer: Okay, and what are your expectations of salary?  Candidate: I would prefer it if it was according to industry standards.  Interviewer: Okay. Do you have any questions from your end?  Candidate: No. I do not have any questions.  Interviewer: Thank you for your time, John. We will get back to you shortly.",

        "summary": "Here\u2019s a structured **summary of core topics, concepts, and principles** for the **\"Foundation Level: English II (Computer-Based Exam)\"** based on the provided question paper.\nThe exam focuses on **reading comprehension, grammar, vocabulary, word formation, sentence structure, and communication skills** (formal/informal contexts).\nNo equations or mathematical concepts are involved.\n\n---\n\n---\n\n### **Core Topics & Concepts**\n#### **1. Reading Comprehension**\n   - **Key Skills**:\n     - Identifying main ideas, supporting details, and inferences.\n     - Understanding context (e.g., cricket match analysis, interview dialogues, emails).\n     - Vocabulary in context (e.g., \"vindicate,\" \"constructive criticism\").\n   - **Passage Types**:\n     - Autobiographical narratives (e.g., Sachin Tendulkar\u2019s match recount).\n     - Interview transcripts (e.g., job interview with questions about strengths/weaknesses).\n     - Emails (e.g., informal meeting requests).\n   - **Common Questions**:\n     - Fact-based (e.g., \"Why did the team decide to field first?\").\n     - Inference-based (e.g., \"What does the narrator\u2019s dismissal reveal about the pitch?\").\n     - Vocabulary (e.g., \"What does \u2018vindicate\u2019 mean?\").\n\n#### **2. Grammar**\n   - **Sentence Transformation**:\n     - **Active \u2192 Passive Voice**:\n       - Rule: **Object (active) \u2192 Subject (passive)** + **auxiliary verb (be + past participle)** + **by + original subject (if needed)**.\n       - Example:\n         - Active: *\"The cook prepared a special dish.\"*\n         - Passive: *\"A special dish **was prepared** by the cook.\"*\n     - **Direct \u2192 Indirect Speech**:\n       - Rule: Change pronouns, tenses (backshift), and question words (e.g., \"did you\" \u2192 \"if he had\").\n       - Example:\n         - Direct: *\"Did you bring your camera?\" she asked.*\n         - Indirect: *She asked **if he had brought** his camera.*\n   - **Question Tags**:\n     - Rule: **Auxiliary verb + subject pronoun** (positive tag for negative sentences, vice versa).\n     - Example: *\"She never had an advantage, **did she**?\"*\n   - **Modals**:\n     - **Obligation**: *Must* (strong), *should* (weak).\n     - **Permission**: *May* (formal denial: *\"You **may not** cross the line.\"*).\n     - **Ability/Possibility**: *Could/might*.\n   - **Conditional Sentences**:\n     - **Second Conditional**: *If + past simple, would + base verb* (hypothetical situations).\n       - Example: *\"If they **were** corrupt, they **would be** facing consequences.\"*\n\n   - **Clauses**:\n     - **Adjectival (Relative) Clauses**: Modify nouns (e.g., *\"whose dedication **was admired**\"*).\n     - **That-Clauses**: Can act as **subjects** (e.g., *\"That it grows in pots **makes** the cactus popular\"*).\n     - **Adjuncts**: Optional adverbial elements (e.g., *\"outside\"* or *\"for a long time\"* in *\"Susan waited outside for a long time\"*).\n\n   - **Conjunctions**:\n     - **Coordinating**: *And, but, or* (join equal clauses).\n     - **Subordinating**: *Because, although* (join dependent clauses).\n\n#### **3. Vocabulary**\n   - **Word Formation Processes**:\n     | Process            | Definition                          | Example                          |\n     |--------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n     | **Back-formation** | Creating a new word by removing affixes. | *Resurrection \u2192 resurrect*       |\n     | **Inflection**     | Adding affixes to show grammatical changes (tense, number). | *Light \u2192 lightest*               |\n     | **Derivation**     | Adding affixes to create a new word (often changing word class). | *Recreation + -al \u2192 recreational* |\n     | **Compounding**    | Combining two words.                | *Capital + intensive \u2192 capital-intensive* |\n     | **Clipping**       | Shortening a word (simple/complex). | *Optical art \u2192 op art*           |\n     | **Blending**       | Merging parts of words.             | *Video + blog \u2192 vlog*            |\n   - **Contrast Words**:\n     - *In spite of, after all, however* (e.g., *\"**In spite of** the signs of dissolution, power shone in his face.\"*).\n   - **Discourse Markers**:\n     - Introduce ideas (e.g., *\"To begin with,\" \"Overall\"*).\n\n   - **Adjectives/Adverbs**:\n     - **Attributive Adjectives**: Describe nouns (e.g., *\"live water\"*).\n     - **Viewpoint Adverbs**: Express opinion (e.g., *\"historically\"*).\n     - **Degree Adverbs**: Intensify (e.g., *\"very much\"*).\n\n#### **4. Writing Skills**\n   - **Emails**:\n     - **Structure**:\n       1. **Salutation**: *Hi [Name]* (informal), *Dear [Title]* (formal).\n       2. **Body**: Clear, concise main message (e.g., *\"Can we meet at 3 PM?\"*).\n       3. **Closing**: *Best, Yours sincerely* (formal), *Best* (informal).\n     - **Tone**: Avoid overly informal language in professional contexts.\n   - **Formal vs. Informal Language**:\n     - **Formal**: Polite, indirect (e.g., *\"Would it be possible to extend the deadline?\"*).\n     - **Informal**: Direct (e.g., *\"Can you extend the deadline?\"*).\n\n#### **5. Communication Skills**\n   - **Social Settings (Student-Teacher Interactions)**:\n     - **Polite Requests**:\n       - *\"I was wondering if you could support me...\"* (additional classes).\n       - *\"Could you please repeat that?\"* (clarifying doubts).\n     - **Avoid**: Demands (e.g., *\"Share notes\"* \u2192 *\"Would it be possible to get lecture notes?\"*).\n   - **Interview Skills**:\n     - **Strengths/Weaknesses**: Focus on teamwork, openness to feedback.\n     - **Crisis Management**: Emphasize problem-solving over blame (e.g., *\"We took responsibility as a team\"*).\n\n#### **6. Literary Devices**\n   - **Metaphor**: Implicit comparison (e.g., *\"Time is money\"*).\n   - **Intonation**: Reduces ambiguity in speech (e.g., stress on *\"present\"* in *\"I didn\u2019t say he stole the present\"*).\n\n---\n\n### **Mermaid Knowledge Graphs**\n#### **1.
