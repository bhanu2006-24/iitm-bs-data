He got up, came out of his shelter and stood before the blind man, wagging his tail and gazing expectantly at the bowl, as he was eating his sparse meal. The blind man swept his arms about and asked, 'Who is there?' at which the dog went up and licked his hand. The blind man stroked its coat gently tail to ear and said, 'What a beauty you are. Come with me\u2014' He threw a handful of food, which the dog ate gratefully. It was perhaps an auspicious moment for starting a friendship. They met every day there, and the dog cut off much of its rambling to sit up beside the blind man and watch him receive alms morning to evening. In course of time, observing him, the dog understood that the passers-by must give a coin, and whoever went away without dropping a coin was chased by the dog; he tugged the edge of their clothes by his teeth and pulled them back to the old man at the gate and let go only after something was dropped in his bowl. Among those who frequented this place was a village urchin, who had the mischief of a devil in him. He liked to tease the blind man by calling him names and by trying to pick up the coins in his bowl. The blind man helplessly shouted and cried and whirled his staff. On Thursdays this boy appeared at the gate, carrying on his head a basket loaded with cucumber or plantain. Every Thursday afternoon it was a crisis in the blind man's life. A seller of bright-coloured but doubtful perfumes with his wares mounted on a wheeled platform, a man who spread out cheap storybooks on a gunny sack, another man who carried coloured ribbons on an elaborate frame\u2014these were the people who usually gathered under the same arch. On a Thursday when the young man appeared at the eastern gate one of them remarked, 'Blind fellow! Here comes your scourge\u2014'  \nExtract from: The Malgudi Days by R.K. Narayan",

He got up, came out of his shelter and stood before the blind man, wagging his tail and gazing expectantly at the bowl, as he was eating his sparse meal. The blind man swept his arms about and asked, 'Who is there?' at which the dog went up and licked his hand. The blind man stroked its coat gently tail to ear and said, 'What a beauty you are. Come with me\u2014' He threw a handful of food, which the dog ate gratefully. It was perhaps an auspicious moment for starting a friendship. They met every day there, and the dog cut off much of its rambling to sit up beside the blind man and watch him receive alms morning to evening. In course of time, observing him, the dog understood that the passers-by must give a coin, and whoever went away without dropping a coin was chased by the dog; he tugged the edge of their clothes by his teeth and pulled them back to the old man at the gate and let go only after something was dropped in his bowl. Among those who frequented this place was a village urchin, who had the mischief of a devil in him. He liked to tease the blind man by calling him names and by trying to pick up the coins in his bowl. The blind man helplessly shouted and cried and whirled his staff. On Thursdays this boy appeared at the gate, carrying on his head a basket loaded with cucumber or plantain. Every Thursday afternoon it was a crisis in the blind man's life. A seller of bright-coloured but doubtful perfumes with his wares mounted on a wheeled platform, a man who spread out cheap storybooks on a gunny sack, another man who carried coloured ribbons on an elaborate frame\u2014these were the people who usually gathered under the same arch.

He got up, came out of his shelter and stood before the blind man, wagging his tail and gazing expectantly at the bowl, as he was eating his sparse meal. The blind man swept his arms about and asked, 'Who is there?' at which the dog went up and licked his hand. The blind man stroked its coat gently tail to ear and said, 'What a beauty you are. Come with me\u2014' He threw a handful of food, which the dog ate gratefully. It was perhaps an auspicious moment for starting a friendship. They met every day there, and the dog cut off much of its rambling to sit up beside the blind man and watch him receive alms morning to evening. In course of time, observing him, the dog understood that the passers-by must give a coin, and whoever went away without dropping a coin was chased by the dog; he tugged the edge of their clothes by his teeth and pulled them back to the old man at the gate and let go only after something was dropped in his bowl. Among those who frequented this place was a village urchin, who had the mischief of a devil in him. He liked to tease the blind man by calling him names and by trying to pick up the coins in his bowl. The blind man helplessly shouted and cried and whirled his staff. On Thursdays this boy appeared at the gate, carrying on his head a basket loaded with cucumber or plantain. Every Thursday afternoon it was a crisis in the blind man's life. A seller of bright-coloured but doubtful perfumes with his wares mounted on a wheeled platform, a man who spread out cheap storybooks on a gunny sack, another man who carried coloured ribbons on an elaborate frame\u2014these were the people who usually gathered under the same arch.

Among those who frequented this place was a village urchin, who had the mischief of a devil in him. He liked to tease the blind man by calling him names and by trying to pick up the coins in his bowl. The blind man helplessly shouted and cried and whirled his staff. On Thursdays this boy appeared at the gate, carrying on his head a basket loaded with cucumber or plantain. Every Thursday afternoon it was a crisis in the blind man's life. A seller of bright-coloured but doubtful perfumes with his wares mounted on a wheeled platform, a man who spread out cheap storybooks on a gunny sack, another man who carried coloured ribbons on an elaborate frame\u2014these were the people who usually gathered under the same arch. On a Thursday when the young man appeared at the eastern gate one of them remarked, 'Blind fellow! Here comes your scourge\u2014'  \nExtract from: The Malgudi Days by R.K. Narayan"

He got up, came out of his shelter and stood before the blind man, wagging his tail and gazing expectantly at the bowl, as he was eating his sparse meal. The blind man swept his arms about and asked, 'Who is there?' at which the dog went up and licked his hand. The blind man stroked its coat gently tail to ear and said, 'What a beauty you are. Come with me\u2014' He threw a handful of food, which the dog ate gratefully. It was perhaps an auspicious moment for starting a friendship. They met every day there, and the dog cut off much of its rambling to sit up beside the blind man and watch him receive alms morning to evening. In course of time, observing him, the dog understood that the passers-by must give a coin, and whoever went away without dropping a coin was chased by the dog; he tugged the edge of their clothes by his teeth and pulled them back to the old man at the gate and let go only after something was dropped in his bowl. Among those who frequented this place was a village urchin, who had the mischief of a devil in him. He liked to tease the blind man by calling him names and by trying to pick up the coins in his bowl. The blind man helplessly shouted and cried and whirled his staff. On Thursdays this boy appeared at the gate, carrying on his head a basket loaded with cucumber or plantain. Every Thursday afternoon it was a crisis in the blind man's life. A seller of bright-coloured but doubtful perfumes with his wares mounted on a wheeled platform, a man who spread out cheap storybooks on a gunny sack, another man who carried coloured ribbons on an elaborate frame\u2014these were the people who usually gathered under the same arch. On a Thursday when the young man appeared at the eastern gate one of them remarked, 'Blind fellow! Here comes your scourge\u2014'  \nExtract from: The Malgudi Days by R.K. Narayan"

Interviewer 1: _____ Candidate: Sir, Prayag is the same as Allahabad; Prayag was the ancient name of the city. Interviewer 1: Indeed. Can you tell us a little about your educational background?  Candidate: I did my primary education from Tagore Public School, Allahabad, and then went on to do my bachelor\u2019s degree in English Language and Literature from the University of Delhi. I did my post-graduation in Human Resource Management from IIM Bangalore. _____  Interviewer 2: A Market Strategy Associate? Your career trajectory appears rather peculiar. _____ It is a strangely slavish choice, don\u2019t you think, to learn something that may well be taken as a sign of colonial oppression? Candidate: (Mildly puzzled for a moment, but quickly regains his composure) Sir, strategization, in the context of a multinational company that offers its services to a substantial and diversified client base, is as much a task of communication as it is one of ideation. English is no longer the language of a particular country or a people. Although we can trace it back to our nation\u2019s colonial past, we can rest assured that it is a language that we have made our own. We leverage English and capitalise on it during our interactions with other international players and markets. Learning literature also impacts the manner in which one thinks because it puts one in intimate contact with some of the best thoughts and creations of humankind. One constantly learns from and draws from a large reservoir of experiences as made available through literature so as to be able to keenly understand the people that one works with, to optimally harness the strengths of those in one\u2019s team and to comprehend and respond to clients\u2019 expectations. My position also requires me to analyse and interpret large amounts of data and have a strong command over various analytical tools. _____ So, different as my qualifications might be, I do believe that they both equally contribute to the manner in which I dispense my duties as a Market Strategy Associate.  Interviewer 1: Well put, Mr. Arora. Can you tell us about an experience where you had to collaborate with others because the project at hand required an expertise which you did not have? \nCandidate: Certainly, sir. What comes to my mind immediately is an instance when I needed legal consultation concerning corporate law both in our country and in the different sites where our client had established operations. _____ He also helped me negotiate transaction documentation and coordinated with external legal counsels.  Interviewer 1: Very well, Mr. Arora. _____ Candidate: Sir, I love to read and to go for walks. I also like to follow the latest news in astronomy with an amateurish interest (smiles). Interviewer 2: Astronomy? Candidate: Yes, sir. Like the James Webb Space Telescope\u2019s recent discovery of enormous mature galaxies in its deep field images.  Interviewer 2: I see.

Your career trajectory appears rather peculiar. _____ It is a strangely slavish choice, don\u2019t you think, to learn something that may well be taken as a sign of colonial oppression? Candidate: (Mildly puzzled for a moment, but quickly regains his composure) Sir, strategization, in the context of a multinational company that offers its services to a substantial and diversified client base, is as much a task of communication as it is one of ideation. English is no longer the language of a particular country or a people. Although we can trace it back to our nation\u2019s colonial past, we can rest assured that it is a language that we have made our own. We leverage English and capitalise on it during our interactions with other international players and markets. Learning literature also impacts the manner in which one thinks because it puts one in intimate contact with some of the best thoughts and creations of humankind. One constantly learns from and draws from a large reservoir of experiences as made available through literature so as to be able to keenly understand the people that one works with, to optimally harness the strengths of those in one\u2019s team and to comprehend and respond to clients\u2019 expectations. My position also requires me to analyse and interpret large amounts of data and have a strong command over various analytical tools. _____ So, different as my qualifications might be, I do believe that they both equally contribute to the manner in which I dispense my duties as a Market Strategy Associate.  Interviewer 1: Well put, Mr. Arora. Can you tell us about an experience where you had to collaborate with others because the project at hand required an expertise which you did not have? \nCandidate: Certainly, sir. What comes to my mind immediately is an instance when I needed legal consultation concerning corporate law both in our country and in the different sites where our client had established operations. _____ He also helped me negotiate transaction documentation and coordinated with external legal counsels.  Interviewer 1: Very well, Mr. Arora. _____ Candidate: Sir, I love to read and to go for walks. I also like to follow the latest news in astronomy with an amateurish interest (smiles). Interviewer 2: Astronomy? Candidate: Yes, sir. Like the James Webb Space Telescope\u2019s recent discovery of enormous mature galaxies in its deep field images.  Interviewer 2: I see.

Candidate: I come from Uttar Pradesh, sir.  Interviewer 1: From where in UP do you hail? Candidate: My hometown is Allahabad, sir.  Interviewer 1: _____ Candidate: Sir, Prayag is the same as Allahabad; Prayag was the ancient name of the city. Interviewer 1: Indeed. Can you tell us a little about your educational background?  Candidate: I did my primary education from Tagore Public School, Allahabad, and then went on to do my bachelor\u2019s degree in English Language and Literature from the University of Delhi. I did my post-graduation in Human Resource Management from IIM Bangalore. _____  Interviewer 2: A Market Strategy Associate? Your career trajectory appears rather peculiar. _____ It is a strangely slavish choice, don\u2019t you think, to learn something that may well be taken as a sign of colonial oppression? Candidate: (Mildly puzzled for a moment, but quickly regains his composure) Sir, strategization, in the context of a multinational company that offers its services to a substantial and diversified client base, is as much a task of communication as it is one of ideation. English is no longer the language of a particular country or a people. Although we can trace it back to our nation\u2019s colonial past, we can rest assured that it is a language that we have made our own. We leverage English and capitalise on it during our interactions with other international players and markets. Learning literature also impacts the manner in which one thinks because it puts one in intimate contact with some of the best thoughts and creations of humankind. One constantly learns from and draws from a large reservoir of experiences as made available through literature so as to be able to keenly understand the people that one works with, to optimally harness the strengths of those in one\u2019s team and to comprehend and respond to clients\u2019 expectations.

                            "Read the following exchange between an interviewer and an interviewee and answer the <b>given subquestions: </b>\n\nCandidate: Good morning (Smiles at the interview panel.) Interviewer 1: Good morning. _____ Candidate: Yes, sir. Siddhant Arora.  Interviewer 2: Please have a seat, Mr. Arora.  Candidate: Thank you, sir. (The candidate calmly takes his seat; he carries his certificates, testimonials, etc., in a well-organised folder which he places on the left side of his table.) (Interviewer 1 seems to whisper something to Interviewer 2, and they share a laugh while looking at the candidate. The candidate feels embarrassed, but hides his awkwardness and remains pleasant, but unaffected. The interviewers study him intently.) Interviewer 1: Mr. Arora, where do you come from? Candidate: I come from Uttar Pradesh, sir.  Interviewer 1: From where in UP do you hail? Candidate: My hometown is Allahabad, sir.  Interviewer 1: _____ Candidate: Sir, Prayag is the same as Allahabad; Prayag was the ancient name of the city. Interviewer 1: Indeed. Can you tell us a little about your educational background?  Candidate: I did my primary education from Tagore Public School, Allahabad, and then went on to do my bachelor\u2019s degree in English Language and Literature from the University of Delhi. I did my post-graduation in Human Resource Management from IIM Bangalore. _____  Interviewer 2: A Market Strategy Associate? Your career trajectory appears rather peculiar. _____ It is a strangely slavish choice, don\u2019t you think, to learn something that may well be taken as a sign of colonial oppression? Candidate: (Mildly puzzled for a moment, but quickly regains his composure) Sir, strategization, in the context of a multinational company that offers its services to a substantial and diversified client base, is as much a task of communication as it is one of ideation. English is no longer the language of a particular country or a people. Although we can trace it back to our nation\u2019s colonial past, we can rest assured that it is a language that we have made our own. We leverage English and capitalise on it during our interactions with other international players and markets. Learning literature also impacts the manner in which one thinks because it puts one in intimate contact with some of the best thoughts and creations of humankind. One constantly learns from and draws from a large reservoir of experiences as made available through literature so as to be able to keenly understand the people that one works with, to optimally harness the strengths of those in one\u2019s team and to comprehend and respond to clients\u2019 expectations. My position also requires me to analyse and interpret large amounts of data and have a strong command over various analytical tools. _____ So, different as my qualifications might be, I do believe that they both equally contribute to the manner in which I dispense my duties as a Market Strategy Associate.  Interviewer 1: Well put, Mr. Arora. Can you tell us about an experience where you had to collaborate with others because the project at hand required an expertise which you did not have? \nCandidate: Certainly, sir. What comes to my mind immediately is an instance when I needed legal consultation concerning corporate law both in our country and in the different sites where our client had established operations. _____ He also helped me negotiate transaction documentation and coordinated with external legal counsels.  Interviewer 1: Very well, Mr. Arora. _____ Candidate: Sir, I love to read and to go for walks. I also like to follow the latest news in astronomy with an amateurish interest (smiles). Interviewer 2: Astronomy? Candidate: Yes, sir. Like the James Webb Space Telescope\u2019s recent discovery of enormous mature galaxies in its deep field images.  Interviewer 2: I see.

                            "Read the following exchange between an interviewer and an interviewee and answer the <b>given subquestions: </b>\n\nCandidate: Good morning (Smiles at the interview panel.) Interviewer 1: Good morning. _____ Candidate: Yes, sir. Siddhant Arora.  Interviewer 2: Please have a seat, Mr. Arora.  Candidate: Thank you, sir. (The candidate calmly takes his seat; he carries his certificates, testimonials, etc., in a well-organised folder which he places on the left side of his table.) (Interviewer 1 seems to whisper something to Interviewer 2, and they share a laugh while looking at the candidate. The candidate feels embarrassed, but hides his awkwardness and remains pleasant, but unaffected. The interviewers study him intently.) Interviewer 1: Mr. Arora, where do you come from? Candidate: I come from Uttar Pradesh, sir.  Interviewer 1: From where in UP do you hail? Candidate: My hometown is Allahabad, sir.  Interviewer 1: _____ Candidate: Sir, Prayag is the same as Allahabad; Prayag was the ancient name of the city. Interviewer 1: Indeed. Can you tell us a little about your educational background?  Candidate: I did my primary education from Tagore Public School, Allahabad, and then went on to do my bachelor\u2019s degree in English Language and Literature from the University of Delhi. I did my post-graduation in Human Resource Management from IIM Bangalore. _____  Interviewer 2: A Market Strategy Associate? Your career trajectory appears rather peculiar. _____ It is a strangely slavish choice, don\u2019t you think, to learn something that may well be taken as a sign of colonial oppression? Candidate: (Mildly puzzled for a moment, but quickly regains his composure) Sir, strategization, in the context of a multinational company that offers its services to a substantial and diversified client base, is as much a task of communication as it is one of ideation. English is no longer the language of a particular country or a people. Although we can trace it back to our nation\u2019s colonial past, we can rest assured that it is a language that we have made our own. We leverage English and capitalise on it during our interactions with other international players and markets. Learning literature also impacts the manner in which one thinks because it puts one in intimate contact with some of the best thoughts and creations of humankind. One constantly learns from and draws from a large reservoir of experiences as made available through literature so as to be able to keenly understand the people that one works with, to optimally harness the strengths of those in one\u2019s team and to comprehend and respond to clients\u2019 expectations. My position also requires me to analyse and interpret large amounts of data and have a strong command over various analytical tools. _____ So, different as my qualifications might be, I do believe that they both equally contribute to the manner in which I dispense my duties as a Market Strategy Associate.  Interviewer 1: Well put, Mr. Arora. Can you tell us about an experience where you had to collaborate with others because the project at hand required an expertise which you did not have? \nCandidate: Certainly, sir. What comes to my mind immediately is an instance when I needed legal consultation concerning corporate law both in our country and in the different sites where our client had established operations. _____ He also helped me negotiate transaction documentation and coordinated with external legal counsels.  Interviewer 1: Very well, Mr. Arora. _____ Candidate: Sir, I love to read and to go for walks. I also like to follow the latest news in astronomy with an amateurish interest (smiles). Interviewer 2: Astronomy? Candidate: Yes, sir. Like the James Webb Space Telescope\u2019s recent discovery of enormous mature galaxies in its deep field images.  Interviewer 2: I see. Interesting (smiles).  Interviewer 1: That will be all for now, Mr. Arora. _____ Have a good day.  Candidate: Thank you, sir. Wish you a good day ahead too.

My position also requires me to analyse and interpret large amounts of data and have a strong command over various analytical tools. _____ So, different as my qualifications might be, I do believe that they both equally contribute to the manner in which I dispense my duties as a Market Strategy Associate.  Interviewer 1: Well put, Mr. Arora. Can you tell us about an experience where you had to collaborate with others because the project at hand required an expertise which you did not have? \nCandidate: Certainly, sir. What comes to my mind immediately is an instance when I needed legal consultation concerning corporate law both in our country and in the different sites where our client had established operations. _____ He also helped me negotiate transaction documentation and coordinated with external legal counsels.  Interviewer 1: Very well, Mr. Arora. _____ Candidate: Sir, I love to read and to go for walks. I also like to follow the latest news in astronomy with an amateurish interest (smiles). Interviewer 2: Astronomy? Candidate: Yes, sir. Like the James Webb Space Telescope\u2019s recent discovery of enormous mature galaxies in its deep field images.  Interviewer 2: I see. Interesting (smiles).  Interviewer 1: That will be all for now, Mr. Arora. _____ Have a good day.  Candidate: Thank you, sir. Wish you a good day ahead too.

Candidate: I come from Uttar Pradesh, sir.  Interviewer 1: From where in UP do you hail? Candidate: My hometown is Allahabad, sir.  Interviewer 1: _____ Candidate: Sir, Prayag is the same as Allahabad; Prayag was the ancient name of the city. Interviewer 1: Indeed. Can you tell us a little about your educational background?  Candidate: I did my primary education from Tagore Public School, Allahabad, and then went on to do my bachelor\u2019s degree in English Language and Literature from the University of Delhi. I did my post-graduation in Human Resource Management from IIM Bangalore. _____  Interviewer 2: A Market Strategy Associate? Your career trajectory appears rather peculiar. _____ It is a strangely slavish choice, don\u2019t you think, to learn something that may well be taken as a sign of colonial oppression? Candidate: (Mildly puzzled for a moment, but quickly regains his composure) Sir, strategization, in the context of a multinational company that offers its services to a substantial and diversified client base, is as much a task of communication as it is one of ideation. English is no longer the language of a particular country or a people. Although we can trace it back to our nation\u2019s colonial past, we can rest assured that it is a language that we have made our own. We leverage English and capitalise on it during our interactions with other international players and markets. Learning literature also impacts the manner in which one thinks because it puts one in intimate contact with some of the best thoughts and creations of humankind. One constantly learns from and draws from a large reservoir of experiences as made available through literature so as to be able to keenly understand the people that one works with, to optimally harness the strengths of those in one\u2019s team and to comprehend and respond to clients\u2019 expectations. My position also requires me to analyse and interpret large amounts of data and have a strong command over various analytical tools. _____ So, different as my qualifications might be, I do believe that they both equally contribute to the manner in which I dispense my duties as a Market Strategy Associate.  Interviewer 1: Well put, Mr. Arora. Can you tell us about an experience where you had to collaborate with others because the project at hand required an expertise which you did not have? \nCandidate: Certainly, sir. What comes to my mind immediately is an instance when I needed legal consultation concerning corporate law both in our country and in the different sites where our client had established operations. _____ He also helped me negotiate transaction documentation and coordinated with external legal counsels.  Interviewer 1: Very well, Mr. Arora. _____ Candidate: Sir, I love to read and to go for walks. I also like to follow the latest news in astronomy with an amateurish interest (smiles). Interviewer 2: Astronomy? Candidate: Yes, sir. Like the James Webb Space Telescope\u2019s recent discovery of enormous mature galaxies in its deep field images.  Interviewer 2: I see.

The candidate feels embarrassed, but hides his awkwardness and remains pleasant, but unaffected. The interviewers study him intently.) Interviewer 1: Mr. Arora, where do you come from? Candidate: I come from Uttar Pradesh, sir.  Interviewer 1: From where in UP do you hail? Candidate: My hometown is Allahabad, sir.  Interviewer 1: _____ Candidate: Sir, Prayag is the same as Allahabad; Prayag was the ancient name of the city. Interviewer 1: Indeed. Can you tell us a little about your educational background?  Candidate: I did my primary education from Tagore Public School, Allahabad, and then went on to do my bachelor\u2019s degree in English Language and Literature from the University of Delhi. I did my post-graduation in Human Resource Management from IIM Bangalore. _____  Interviewer 2: A Market Strategy Associate? Your career trajectory appears rather peculiar. _____ It is a strangely slavish choice, don\u2019t you think, to learn something that may well be taken as a sign of colonial oppression? Candidate: (Mildly puzzled for a moment, but quickly regains his composure) Sir, strategization, in the context of a multinational company that offers its services to a substantial and diversified client base, is as much a task of communication as it is one of ideation. English is no longer the language of a particular country or a people. Although we can trace it back to our nation\u2019s colonial past, we can rest assured that it is a language that we have made our own. We leverage English and capitalise on it during our interactions with other international players and markets. Learning literature also impacts the manner in which one thinks because it puts one in intimate contact with some of the best thoughts and creations of humankind. One constantly learns from and draws from a large reservoir of experiences as made available through literature so as to be able to keenly understand the people that one works with, to optimally harness the strengths of those in one\u2019s team and to comprehend and respond to clients\u2019 expectations. My position also requires me to analyse and interpret large amounts of data and have a strong command over various analytical tools. _____ So, different as my qualifications might be, I do believe that they both equally contribute to the manner in which I dispense my duties as a Market Strategy Associate.  Interviewer 1: Well put, Mr. Arora. Can you tell us about an experience where you had to collaborate with others because the project at hand required an expertise which you did not have? \nCandidate: Certainly, sir. What comes to my mind immediately is an instance when I needed legal consultation concerning corporate law both in our country and in the different sites where our client had established operations. _____ He also helped me negotiate transaction documentation and coordinated with external legal counsels.  Interviewer 1: Very well, Mr. Arora. _____ Candidate: Sir, I love to read and to go for walks. I also like to follow the latest news in astronomy with an amateurish interest (smiles). Interviewer 2: Astronomy? Candidate: Yes, sir. Like the James Webb Space Telescope\u2019s recent discovery of enormous mature galaxies in its deep field images.  Interviewer 2: I see. Interesting (smiles).  Interviewer 1: That will be all for now, Mr. Arora. _____ Have a good day.  Candidate: Thank you, sir. Wish you a good day ahead too.

(Interviewer 1 seems to whisper something to Interviewer 2, and they share a laugh while looking at the candidate. The candidate feels embarrassed, but hides his awkwardness and remains pleasant, but unaffected. The interviewers study him intently.) Interviewer 1: Mr. Arora, where do you come from? Candidate: I come from Uttar Pradesh, sir.  Interviewer 1: From where in UP do you hail? Candidate: My hometown is Allahabad, sir.  Interviewer 1: _____ Candidate: Sir, Prayag is the same as Allahabad; Prayag was the ancient name of the city. Interviewer 1: Indeed. Can you tell us a little about your educational background?  Candidate: I did my primary education from Tagore Public School, Allahabad, and then went on to do my bachelor\u2019s degree in English Language and Literature from the University of Delhi. I did my post-graduation in Human Resource Management from IIM Bangalore. _____  Interviewer 2: A Market Strategy Associate? Your career trajectory appears rather peculiar. _____ It is a strangely slavish choice, don\u2019t you think, to learn something that may well be taken as a sign of colonial oppression? Candidate: (Mildly puzzled for a moment, but quickly regains his composure) Sir, strategization, in the context of a multinational company that offers its services to a substantial and diversified client base, is as much a task of communication as it is one of ideation. English is no longer the language of a particular country or a people. Although we can trace it back to our nation\u2019s colonial past, we can rest assured that it is a language that we have made our own. We leverage English and capitalise on it during our interactions with other international players and markets. Learning literature also impacts the manner in which one thinks because it puts one in intimate contact with some of the best thoughts and creations of humankind. One constantly learns from and draws from a large reservoir of experiences as made available through literature so as to be able to keenly understand the people that one works with, to optimally harness the strengths of those in one\u2019s team and to comprehend and respond to clients\u2019 expectations. My position also requires me to analyse and interpret large amounts of data and have a strong command over various analytical tools. _____ So, different as my qualifications might be, I do believe that they both equally contribute to the manner in which I dispense my duties as a Market Strategy Associate.  Interviewer 1: Well put, Mr. Arora. Can you tell us about an experience where you had to collaborate with others because the project at hand required an expertise which you did not have? \nCandidate: Certainly, sir. What comes to my mind immediately is an instance when I needed legal consultation concerning corporate law both in our country and in the different sites where our client had established operations. _____ He also helped me negotiate transaction documentation and coordinated with external legal counsels.  Interviewer 1: Very well, Mr. Arora. _____ Candidate: Sir, I love to read and to go for walks. I also like to follow the latest news in astronomy with an amateurish interest (smiles). Interviewer 2: Astronomy? Candidate: Yes, sir. Like the James Webb Space Telescope\u2019s recent discovery of enormous mature galaxies in its deep field images.  Interviewer 2: I see. Interesting (smiles).  Interviewer 1: That will be all for now, Mr. Arora. _____ Have a good day.  Candidate: Thank you, sir. Wish you a good day ahead too.

(The candidate calmly takes his seat; he carries his certificates, testimonials, etc., in a well-organised folder which he places on the left side of his table.) (Interviewer 1 seems to whisper something to Interviewer 2, and they share a laugh while looking at the candidate. The candidate feels embarrassed, but hides his awkwardness and remains pleasant, but unaffected. The interviewers study him intently.) Interviewer 1: Mr. Arora, where do you come from? Candidate: I come from Uttar Pradesh, sir.  Interviewer 1: From where in UP do you hail? Candidate: My hometown is Allahabad, sir.  Interviewer 1: _____ Candidate: Sir, Prayag is the same as Allahabad; Prayag was the ancient name of the city. Interviewer 1: Indeed. Can you tell us a little about your educational background?  Candidate: I did my primary education from Tagore Public School, Allahabad, and then went on to do my bachelor\u2019s degree in English Language and Literature from the University of Delhi. I did my post-graduation in Human Resource Management from IIM Bangalore. _____  Interviewer 2: A Market Strategy Associate? Your career trajectory appears rather peculiar. _____ It is a strangely slavish choice, don\u2019t you think, to learn something that may well be taken as a sign of colonial oppression? Candidate: (Mildly puzzled for a moment, but quickly regains his composure) Sir, strategization, in the context of a multinational company that offers its services to a substantial and diversified client base, is as much a task of communication as it is one of ideation. English is no longer the language of a particular country or a people. Although we can trace it back to our nation\u2019s colonial past, we can rest assured that it is a language that we have made our own. We leverage English and capitalise on it during our interactions with other international players and markets. Learning literature also impacts the manner in which one thinks because it puts one in intimate contact with some of the best thoughts and creations of humankind. One constantly learns from and draws from a large reservoir of experiences as made available through literature so as to be able to keenly understand the people that one works with, to optimally harness the strengths of those in one\u2019s team and to comprehend and respond to clients\u2019 expectations. My position also requires me to analyse and interpret large amounts of data and have a strong command over various analytical tools. _____ So, different as my qualifications might be, I do believe that they both equally contribute to the manner in which I dispense my duties as a Market Strategy Associate.  Interviewer 1: Well put, Mr. Arora. Can you tell us about an experience where you had to collaborate with others because the project at hand required an expertise which you did not have? \nCandidate: Certainly, sir. What comes to my mind immediately is an instance when I needed legal consultation concerning corporate law both in our country and in the different sites where our client had established operations. _____ He also helped me negotiate transaction documentation and coordinated with external legal counsels.  Interviewer 1: Very well, Mr. Arora. _____ Candidate: Sir, I love to read and to go for walks. I also like to follow the latest news in astronomy with an amateurish interest (smiles). Interviewer 2: Astronomy? Candidate: Yes, sir. Like the James Webb Space Telescope\u2019s recent discovery of enormous mature galaxies in its deep field images.  Interviewer 2: I see. Interesting (smiles).  Interviewer 1: That will be all for now, Mr. Arora. _____ Have a good day.  Candidate: Thank you, sir. Wish you a good day ahead too.

        "summary": "Here\u2019s a structured **summary of core topics, concepts, and principles** for the **\"Foundation Level: English II (Computer-Based Exam)\"** based on the provided question paper.\nThe exam tests **comprehension, grammar, vocabulary, communication skills, and critical reasoning** in English.\nNo equations are required for this subject, but rules, exceptions, and contextual usage are critical.\n\n---\n\n### **Core Topics & Concepts**\n#### **1. Reading Comprehension**\n   - **Key Skills**:\n     - Identifying main ideas, supporting details, and inferences.\n     - Understanding character traits, plot development, and themes (e.g., friendship, conflict, morality).\n     - Analyzing tone, mood, and author\u2019s purpose.\n     - Drawing conclusions from implicit information.\n   - **Example Contexts**:\n     - Literary passages (e.g., *Malgudi Days* by R.K. Narayan).\n     - Dialogues (e.g., interview transcripts, courtroom exchanges).\n   - **Strategies**:\n     - Skim for general ideas, then scan for specific details.\n     - Pay attention to **transition words** (e.g., \"however,\" \"therefore\") and **signal phrases** (e.g., \"the author argues\").\n\n#### **2. Grammar**\n   - **Parts of Speech**:\n     - Nouns, pronouns, verbs (transitive/intransitive), adjectives (attributive/predicative), adverbs, prepositions, conjunctions, interjections.\n     - **Example**: Identify the **participle** in \"The younger generation prefers scratched denims\" \u2192 \"scratched.\"\n   - **Tenses and Aspects**:\n     - Present/past/future (simple, continuous, perfect, perfect continuous).\n     - **Example**: \"I will give you the bedroom\" \u2192 **future indefinite**.\n   - **Voice (Active/Passive)**:\n     - Conversion rules (e.g., \"Ferrari won\" \u2192 \"The championship was won by Ferrari\").\n   - **Conditionals**:\n     - Zero, first, second, third conditionals.\n     - **Example**: \"They would not have missed the train if they had left early\" \u2192 **third conditional**.\n   - **Direct/Indirect Speech**:\n     - Rules for conversion (e.g., pronouns, tenses, modals).\n     - **Example**: Direct: *\"What time does the train leave?\"* \u2192 Indirect: *He asked what time the train left.*\n\n#### **3. Vocabulary**\n   - **Word Meanings**:\n     - Contextual usage (e.g., \"bona fide\" = authentic).\n     - **Antonyms/Synonyms**: \"Tugged\" (antonym = \"pushed\").\n   - **Prefixes/Suffixes**:\n     - Common affixes and their meanings (e.g., \"-gamy\" = marriage, \"mega-\" = big).\n     - **Example**: \"Obliquely\" (suffix \"-ly\" = adverb).\n   - **Idioms/Proverbs**:\n     - Literal vs. figurative meanings (e.g., \"Youth is wasted on the young\" = **paradox**, not oxymoron).\n   - **Literary Devices**:\n     - Oxymoron, paradox, alliteration, metaphor, simile.\n     - **Example**: \"The song of birds is strictly a territorial claim\" \u2192 **metaphor**.\n\n#### **4.
