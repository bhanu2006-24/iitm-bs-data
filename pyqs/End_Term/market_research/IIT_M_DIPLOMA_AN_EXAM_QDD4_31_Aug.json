        "summary": "Here\u2019s a structured **summary of core topics, concepts, and equations** for the **Market Research (Computer-Based Exam)**, followed by **Mermaid knowledge graphs** to visualize relationships.\n\n---\n\n### **Core Topics & Concepts**\n#### **1. Types of Market Research**\n- **Qualitative Research**:\n  - Explores *emotions, motivations, and attitudes* (e.g., emotional bond between pet parents and pets).\n  - Methods: Interviews, focus groups, laddering techniques.\n- **Quantitative Research**:\n  - Measures *numerical data* (e.g., grooming habits, brand awareness percentages).\n  - Methods: Surveys, experiments, conjoint analysis.\n- **Product Testing**:\n  - **Blind Product Test**: Respondents evaluate products *without knowing the brand*.\n  - **Sequential Monadic Testing**: Respondents compare *two products sequentially*.\n  - **Conjoint Analysis**: Evaluates trade-offs between product attributes.\n\n#### **2. Brand Health Metrics**\nKey metrics derived from the table (columns: **TOM**, **Unaided Awareness**, **Total Awareness**, **Brands Ever Used**, **Current Brand**):\n- **Top of Mind (TOM)**: First brand recalled in a category.\n- **Unaided Awareness**: Brands recalled *without prompts*.\n- **Total Awareness**: Sum of *aided + unaided* awareness.\n- **Trial Ratio** = (Brands Ever Used) / (Total Awareness).\n  - *Example*: Brand A = 29% / 11% = **2.64** (but options suggest 0.52; likely a misinterpretation\u2014correct formula is **Brands Ever Used / Total Awareness**).\n  - *Correction*: For Brand A, **Trial Ratio = 15% / 29% \u2248 0.52** (matches Q8).\n- **Lapsing Ratio** = 1 \u2013 (Current Brand Users / Brands Ever Used).\n  - *Example*: Brand E = 1 \u2013 (24% / 30%) = **0.20** (matches Q10).\n- **Awareness Gap** = Total Awareness \u2013 Unaided Awareness.\n  - *Example*: Brand J has the *lowest gap* (0% \u2013 0% = 0).\n\n#### **3. Statistical Tests**\n- **T-test**: Compares *means of two independent samples* (e.g., brand preference between groups).\n- **Chi-square**: Tests *categorical data associations* (e.g., brand usage vs. demographics).\n- **Kolmogorov-Smirnov**: Tests *distribution differences* (non-parametric).\n- **Correlation**: Measures *relationship strength* (not for means comparison).\n\n#### **4. Research Methodologies**\n- **Retail Audits**: Track *sales, distribution, and inventory* (does **not** profile end consumers).\n- **Consumer Panels**: Track *household purchasing behavior* (does **not** include retail outlets).\n- **Central Limit Theorem (CLT)**: Sample size **\u226530** ensures normal distribution of means.\n\n#### **5. Media Metrics**\n- **AIR (Average Issue Readership)**: Average number of readers per issue.\n- **OTS (Opportunity To See)**: Frequency a consumer is exposed to an ad.\n\n#### **6. Relevant Terms in Brand Health Studies**\n- **Brand Awareness** (Top of Mind, Unaided, Total).\n- **Brand Disposition** (attitudes toward the brand).\n- **Consumer Involvement** (high/low engagement in the category).\n- **Clutter Cut-Through** (brand\u2019s ability to stand out).\n- **Brands Used in the Past** (historical usage data).\n\n---\n\n### **Key Equations**\n1. **Trial Ratio**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Trial Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Brands Ever Used (\\%)}}{\\text{Total Awareness (\\%)}}\n   \\]\n   - *Example (Brand C)*: \\( \\frac{9\\%}{45\\%} = 0.20 \\).\n\n2. **Lapsing Ratio**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Lapsing Ratio} = 1 - \\frac{\\text{Current Brand Users (\\%)}}{\\text{Brands Ever Used (\\%)}}\n   \\]\n   - *Example (Brand F)*: \\( 1 - \\frac{32\\%}{48\\%} = 0.33 \\).\n\n3. **Awareness Gap**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Gap} = \\text{Total Awareness} - \\text{Unaided Awareness}\n   \\]\n   - *Example (Brand J)*: \\( 0\\% - 0\\% = 0 \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Mermaid Knowledge Graphs**\n#### **Graph 1: Market Research Types & Methods**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Market Research] --> B[Qualitative]\n    A --> C[Quantitative]\n    A --> D[Product Testing]\n\n    B --> B1[Emotional Insights]\n    B --> B2[Interviews/Focus Groups]\n    C --> C1[Numerical Data]\n    C --> C2[Surveys/Experiments]\n    D --> D1[Blind Testing]\n    D --> D2[Sequential Monadic]\n    D --> D3[Conjoint Analysis]\n```\n\n#### **Graph 2: Brand Health Metrics**\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n    E[Brand Health] --> F[Awareness]\n    E --> G[Trial Ratio]\n    E --> H[Lapsing Ratio]\n\n    F --> F1[TOM]\n    F --> F2[Unaided]\n    F --> F3[Total]\n\n    G --> G1[\"Brands Ever Used / Total Awareness\"]\n    H --> H1[\"1 - (Current Users / Ever Used)\"]\n```\n\n#### **Graph 3: Statistical Tests**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    I[Statistical Tests] --> J[T-test]\n    I --> K[Chi-square]\n    I --> L[Kolmogorov-Smirnov]\n    I --> M[Correlation]\n\n    J --> J1[Compare Means]\n    K --> K1[Categorical Associations]\n    L --> L1[Distribution Differences]\n    M --> M1[Relationship Strength]\n```\n\n#### **Graph 4: Research Methodologies**\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n    N[Methodologies] --> O[Retail Audits]\n    N --> P[Consumer Panels]\n    N --> Q[Central Limit Theorem]\n\n    O --> O1[Sales/Inventory Tracking]\n    P --> P1[Household Purchase Data]\n    Q --> Q1[Sample Size \u226530]\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Exam Tips**\n1. **Qualitative vs. Quantitative**:\n   - *Emotions/motivations* \u2192 Qualitative.\n   - *Proportions/percentages* \u2192 Quantitative.\n2. **Product Testing**:\n   - *Blind test* = anonymous samples.\n   - *Sequential monadic* = compare two samples.\n3. **Brand Metrics**:\n   - *Lowest awareness gap* \u2192 Brand J (0%).\n   - *Highest lapsing ratio* \u2192 Brand J (1.0).\n   - *Lowest lapsing ratio* \u2192 Brand D (near 0).\n4. **Statistical Tests**:\n   - *Compare means* \u2192 T-test.\n   - *Categorical data* \u2192 Chi-square.\n5. **True/False**:\n   - Retail audits **do not** profile consumers.\n   - Consumer panels **exclude** retail outlets.",
