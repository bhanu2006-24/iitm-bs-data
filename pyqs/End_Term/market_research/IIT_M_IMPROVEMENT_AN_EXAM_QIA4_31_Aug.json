Core Topics & Concepts**\n#### **A. Types of Market Research**\n1. **Qualitative Research**\n   - Explores *emotions, motivations, and perceptions* (e.g., emotional bond between pet parents and pets).\n   - Methods: Focus groups, in-depth interviews, laddering techniques.\n   - **Key Use Case**: Understanding *why* consumers behave a certain way.\n\n2. **Quantitative Research**\n   - Measures *numerical data* (e.g., grooming habits, brand awareness percentages).\n   - Methods: Surveys, experiments, online/offline questionnaires.\n   - **Key Use Case**: Statistical analysis (e.g., proportions, means, correlations).\n\n3. **Product Testing**\n   - **Blind Product Test**: Respondents evaluate a product *without knowing the brand*.\n   - **Sequential Monadic Testing**: Respondents test *multiple products sequentially* and compare them.\n   - **Conjoint Analysis**: Evaluates trade-offs between product attributes.\n\n4. **Brand Health Metrics**\n   - **Top of Mind (TOM)**: First brand recalled in a category.\n   - **Unaided Awareness**: Brands recalled without prompts.\n   - **Total Awareness**: Unaided + aided awareness.\n   - **Brands Ever Used (Trial)**: Percentage of consumers who tried the brand.\n   - **Current Brand Usage**: Percentage currently using the brand.\n   - **Lapsing Ratio**:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Lapsing Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Brands Ever Used} - \\text{Current Brand Usage}}{\\text{Brands Ever Used}}\n     \\]\n   - **Trial-to-Total Awareness Ratio**:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Trial Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Brands Ever Used}}{\\text{Total Awareness}}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Statistical Tests**\n   - **T-test**: Compares *means of two independent samples*.\n   - **Chi-square**: Tests *categorical data associations*.\n   - **Kolmogorov-Smirnov**: Tests *distribution differences*.\n   - **Correlation**: Measures *relationship strength* between variables.\n\n6. **Media Metrics**\n   - **AIR (Average Issue Readership)**: Average number of readers per issue.\n   - **OTS (Opportunity To See)**: Frequency of ad exposure chances.\n\n7. **Sampling & Data Collection**\n   - **Central Limit Theorem (CLT)**: Sample size \u226530 for normal distribution approximation.\n   - **Retail Audits**: Track *sales, distribution, and inventory* (not consumer profiles).\n   - **Consumer Panels**: Track *consumer behavior* (not retail outlets).\n\n8. **Qualitative Techniques**\n   - **Laddering**: Links product attributes to *personal values*.\n   - **Sentence Completion**: Respondents complete partial sentences.\n   - **TAT (Thematic Apperception Test)**: Interpretive storytelling based on images.\n\n---\n\n### **2.
