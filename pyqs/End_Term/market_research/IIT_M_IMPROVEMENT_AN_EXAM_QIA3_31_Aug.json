        "summary": "Here\u2019s a structured **summary of core topics, concepts, principles, and equations** for the **Market Research (Computer-Based Exam)**, along with **Mermaid knowledge graphs** to visualize relationships.\n\n---\n\n## **1. Core Topics & Concepts**\n### **A. Types of Market Research**\n1. **Qualitative Research**\n   - Explores **emotions, motivations, and perceptions** (e.g., emotional bond between pet parents and pets).\n   - Methods: Focus groups, in-depth interviews, laddering techniques.\n   - **Use Case**: Understanding **why** consumers behave a certain way.\n\n2. **Quantitative Research**\n   - Measures **numerical data** (e.g., grooming habits, brand awareness percentages).\n   - Methods: Surveys, structured questionnaires, online/offline data collection.\n   - **Use Case**: Determining **how many** consumers exhibit a behavior.\n\n3. **Product Testing Methods**\n   - **Blind Product Test**: Respondents evaluate a product **without knowing the brand**.\n   - **Sequential Monadic Testing**: Respondents test **one product at a time** and compare them later.\n   - **Conjoint Analysis**: Evaluates **trade-offs** between product features.\n\n4. **Demand Estimation Study**\n   - Forecasts **market demand** for a product/service.\n\n---\n\n### **B. Statistical Tests in Market Research**\n| **Test**               | **Purpose**                                  | **When to Use**                          |\n|------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|\n| **T-test**             | Compare **means of two independent samples** | A/B testing, brand preference analysis  |\n| **Chi-square**         | Test **association between categorical variables** | Brand awareness vs. usage patterns |\n| **Kolmogorov-Smirnov** | Compare **distributions** of two samples    | Non-parametric alternative to T-test   |\n| **Correlation**        | Measure **relationship strength** between variables | Sales vs. advertising spend |\n\n---\n\n### **C. Brand Health Metrics**\n#### **Key Metrics from the Table**\n| **Metric**               | **Formula**                                  | **Interpretation**                      |\n|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|\n| **Unaided Awareness**    | % of respondents naming brand **without prompts** | Measures **top-of-mind recall**        |\n| **Total Awareness**      | % of respondents **recognizing** the brand (aided + unaided) | Overall **brand visibility**            |\n| **Trial Ratio**          | `Brands Ever Used / Total Awareness`        | % of aware consumers who **tried** the brand |\n| **Lapsing Ratio**        | `(Brands Ever Used - Current Users) / Brands Ever Used` | % of trial users who **stopped using** the brand |\n| **Current Brand Usage**  | % of respondents **currently using** the brand | **Loyalty & retention** indicator       |\n\n#### **Key Observations from the Data**\n- **Brand D** dominates in all metrics (highest awareness, trial, and retention).\n- **Brand J** has the **highest lapsing ratio (1.0)** \u2192 Almost all trial users stopped using it.\n- **Brand D** has the **lowest lapsing ratio (0.03)** \u2192 Strong retention.\n- **Brand B** has a **low trial-to-awareness ratio (1.0)** \u2192 Poor conversion from awareness to trial.\n\n---\n\n### **D. Market Research Terminology**\n| **Term**               | **Definition**                                                                 |\n|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **AIR (Average Issue Readership)** | Average number of readers per issue of a publication.                        |\n| **OTS (Opportunity To See)**      | Number of times an ad is **potentially seen** by the target audience.         |\n| **Central Limit Theorem (CLT)**   | Sample size **\u226530** ensures normal distribution of means (golden rule).      |\n| **Retail Audits**                | Tracks **sales, distribution, and inventory** (not consumer profiles).       |\n| **Consumer Panels**              | **Households** providing repeated purchase data (not retail outlets).         |\n\n---\n\n### **E. Quantitative Brand Health Study Components**\nFive key metrics:\n1. **Brand Awareness** (Top-of-Mind, Unaided, Aided)\n2. **Brand Disposition** (Loyalty, Switching Behavior)\n3. **Level of Consumer Involvement** (High/Low engagement in category)\n4. **Top-of-Mind (TOM) Brand** (First brand recalled)\n5. **Brands Used in the Past** (Trial & lapsing analysis)\n\n---\n---\n\n## **2. Key Equations (Math Focus)**\n### **(A) Trial Ratio**\n\\[\n\\text{Trial Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Brands Ever Used (\\%)}}{\\text{Total Awareness (\\%)}}\n\\]\n- **Example (Brand A)**:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{29}{11} = 2.64 \\quad (\\text{But given options suggest } 0.52 \\text{\u2014likely a misprint in question.})\n  \\]\n  *(Note: The question likely refers to **Trial-to-Awareness Ratio = (Brands Ever Used - Current Users) / Total Awareness**.)*\n\n### **(B) Lapsing Ratio**\n\\[\n\\text{Lapsing Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Brands Ever Used - Current Users}}{\\text{Brands Ever Used}}\n\\]\n- **Example (Brand E)**:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{30 - 24}{30} = 0.20 \\quad (\\text{Matches option A})\n  \\]\n- **Example (Brand J)**:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{18 - 0}{18} = 1.0 \\quad (\\text{Highest lapsing ratio})\n  \\]\n\n---\n---\n\n## **3.
