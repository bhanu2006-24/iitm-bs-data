        "summary": "Here\u2019s a structured **summary of core topics, concepts, principles, and equations** for the **Market Research (Computer-Based Exam)**, along with **Mermaid knowledge graphs** to visualize relationships.\n\n---\n\n## **1. Core Topics & Concepts**\n### **A. Types of Market Research**\n1. **Qualitative Research**\n   - Explores **emotions, motivations, and perceptions** (e.g., emotional bond between pet parents and pets).\n   - Methods: Focus groups, in-depth interviews, laddering techniques.\n   - **Use Case**: Understanding **why** consumers behave a certain way.\n\n2. **Quantitative Research**\n   - Measures **numerical data** (e.g., grooming habits, brand awareness percentages).\n   - Methods: Surveys, experiments, structured questionnaires.\n   - **Use Case**: Determining **how many** consumers exhibit a behavior.\n\n3. **Product Testing Methods**\n   - **Blind Product Test**: Respondents evaluate a product **without knowing the brand**.\n   - **Sequential Monadic Testing**: Respondents test **one product at a time** and compare.\n   - **Conjoint Analysis**: Evaluates **trade-offs** between product attributes.\n\n---\n\n### **B. Statistical Tests**\n| **Test**               | **Purpose**                                  | **When to Use**                          |\n|------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|\n| **T-test**             | Compare **means of two independent groups** | A/B testing, brand preference analysis  |\n| **Chi-square**         | Test **association between categorical variables** | Survey response analysis |\n| **Kolmogorov-Smirnov** | Compare **distributions**                  | Non-parametric data testing             |\n| **Correlation**        | Measure **relationship strength** between variables | Predictive modeling |\n\n---\n\n### **C. Brand Health Metrics**\n#### **Key Metrics from the Table**\n| **Metric**                     | **Formula**                                  | **Interpretation**                      |\n|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|\n| **Unaided Awareness Gap**      | `Total Awareness - Unaided Awareness`       | Lower gap = Stronger **spontaneous recall** |\n| **Trial-to-Total Awareness**   | `Brands Ever Used / Total Awareness`        | Measures **conversion from awareness to trial** |\n| **Lapsing Ratio**              | `(Brands Ever Used - Current Users) / Brands Ever Used` | **% of trial users who stopped using** |\n\n#### **Key Observations from the Table**\n- **Brand D** dominates in all metrics (highest awareness, usage, and loyalty).\n- **Brand J** has the **highest lapsing ratio (1.0)** (all trial users stopped using).\n- **Brand D** has the **lowest lapsing ratio (0.03)** (high retention).\n- **Brand A\u2019s** trial-to-awareness ratio = **29% / 11% = 2.64** (but options given were simplified).\n\n---\n\n### **D. Market Research Terminology**\n| **Term**               | **Full Form**               | **Meaning**                                                                 |\n|------------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **AIR**                | Average Issue Readership    | Avg. number of readers per magazine/issue.                                |\n| **OTS**                | Opportunity To See         | How often an ad is **seen by the target audience**.                       |\n| **CLT (Sample Size)**  | Central Limit Theorem       | **n \u2265 30** ensures normal distribution approximation for means.           |\n| **Retail Audits**      | -                          | Tracks **sales, distribution, and inventory** (not consumer profiling).  |\n| **Consumer Panels**     | -                          | **Households** tracked for purchasing behavior (not retail outlets).      |\n\n---\n\n### **E. Quantitative Brand Health Study Components**\n\u2705 **Relevant Terms** (from Q19):\n1. **Brand Awareness** (Top-of-Mind, Unaided, Total)\n2. **Brand Disposition** (Loyalty, Switching behavior)\n3. **Level of Consumer Involvement** (High/low engagement categories)\n4. **Top-of-Mind (TOM) Brand** (First brand recalled)\n5. **Brands Used in the Past** (Trial & lapsing analysis)\n\n\u274c **Irrelevant Terms**:\n- Laddering of benefits (Qualitative)\n- Blind testing (Product testing)\n- Employee motivation (HR, not consumer research)\n- Reliability testing (Product engineering)\n- Clutter cut-through (Advertising effectiveness)\n\n---\n\n## **2. Key Equations (Math-Related)**\n### **A. Brand Metrics Calculations**\n1. **Trial-to-Total Awareness Ratio**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Brands Ever Used (\\%)}}{\\text{Total Awareness (\\%)}}\n   \\]\n   - **Brand A**: \\( \\frac{29}{11} = 2.64 \\) (but simplified to **0.52** in options, likely a typo).\n   - **Brand C**: \\( \\frac{9}{45} = 0.20 \\).\n\n2. **Lapsing Ratio**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Lapsing Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Brands Ever Used - Current Users}}{\\text{Brands Ever Used}}\n   \\]\n   - **Brand E**: \\( \\frac{30 - 24}{30} = 0.20 \\).\n   - **Brand F**: \\( \\frac{48 - 32}{48} = 0.33 \\).\n   - **Brand J**: \\( \\frac{18 - 0}{18} = 1.0 \\) (highest).\n\n---\n\n### **B. Statistical Tests**\n1. **Independent Samples T-test**\n   - Tests if **two group means** are significantly different.\n   - Assumptions: Normality, equal variance.\n\n2. **Chi-Square Test**\n   - Tests **association between categorical variables** (e.g., brand preference vs. demographics).\n\n---\n\n## **3.
