You are making progress on things that need to be done. It seems that you have fixed your problem. After a few more weeks, the original project deadline is only hours away. Now you no longer have the time, the needed information or the human capital resources to meet the deadline. The initial problem of having some difficulty completing certain aspects of the project has now become an even bigger problem, resulting in a missed deadline.

He is considering investing a significant amount of money into a new marketing campaign that will promote the company's products on social media and other online platforms. Lehani believes that the new campaign will drive sales and increase brand awareness, but he is concerned about the impact on the company's finances. He also considers the potential risks associated with the investment, such as the possibility of negative customer feedback or poor return on investment.

        "summary": "Here\u2019s a structured **summary of core topics, concepts, principles, and key takeaways** from the exam, followed by **Mermaid knowledge graphs** to visualize relationships.\n\n---\n\n### **Core Topics & Concepts**\n#### **1. Team Dynamics & Leadership (Belbin Roles, Conflict Resolution)**\n- **Belbin Team Roles (1981):**\n  - **Resource Investigator**: Extroverted, enthusiastic, explores opportunities.\n  - Other roles: Co-ordinator, Shaper, Implementer, etc.\n- **Conflict Resolution Strategies:**\n  - Focus on **underlying interests** (not positions).\n  - Use **factual debate** to depersonalize conflicts.\n  - Avoid power imbalances or humor in high-stakes scenarios.\n- **Employee Voice:**\n  - Two-way communication fostering engagement, collaboration, and performance.\n  - *Not* a tool for management control or one-way feedback.\n\n#### **2. Goal-Setting & Motivation**\n- **Goal-Setting Theory (Locke & Latham):**\n  - **Specific, challenging, time-bound goals** \u2192 Higher motivation/performance.\n  - Vague/easy goals \u2192 Lower outcomes.\n- **Maslow\u2019s Hierarchy of Needs:**\n  - **Esteem Needs**: Self-respect, recognition, achievement.\n  - Other levels: Physiological \u2192 Safety \u2192 Love/Belonging \u2192 Self-Actualization.\n\n#### **3. Mindset & Resilience**\n- **Fixed vs. Growth Mindset (Dweck):**\n  - **Fixed**: Belief in innate ability \u2192 Avoids challenges \u2192 Stagnation.\n  - **Growth**: Embraces learning \u2192 Resilience \u2192 Skill development.\n  - **Consequences of Fixed Mindset**: Lack of growth, reduced adaptability.\n- **4R Framework (Growth Mindset):**\n  - **Refocus**: Continuous improvement, tiny gains, clarity of goals/vision.\n- **Resilience**:\n  - **Least resilient response**: Withdrawal (e.g., refusing treatment).\n  - **Resilient responses**: Seeking feedback, leveraging support systems.\n\n#### **4. Systems Thinking (Peter Senge\u2019s *The Fifth Discipline*)**\n- **Key Habits**:\n  - Resist quick conclusions.\n  - Identify **patterns/trends** (e.g., recurring vs. one-time issues).\n  - See the **bigger picture** (long-term impacts).\n- **Archetypes**:\n  - **Fixes That Backfire**: Short-term solutions worsen long-term problems (e.g., avoiding a project \u2192 missed deadline).\n  - **Leverage**: Small changes \u2192 Significant, enduring improvements.\n- **Causal Loop Diagrams (CLD):**\n  - **Qualitative** tool to map system structure/behavior.\n  - *Not* quantitative (unlike simulation models).\n\n#### **5. Cross-Cultural Competence (Hofstede\u2019s Dimensions)**\n- **Uncertainty Avoidance**:\n  - Comfort with risk/ambiguity (e.g., strict rules vs. flexibility).\n- **Individualism vs. Collectivism**:\n  - **Individualism**: Prioritizes personal goals over group.\n  - *Not* about social identity being molded by community (that\u2019s collectivism).\n- **Conflict Resolution Across Cultures**:\n  - **Cultural Compromise**: Blend styles (e.g., direct + indirect communication).\n\n#### **6. Personal Finance**\n- **Income/Expenditure**:\n  - **Surplus**: Cash receipts > cash payments.\n- **Interest Rates**:\n  - **Variable Rate**: Can change anytime (vs. fixed or tiered rates).\n- **Investments**:\n  - **Mutual Funds**: Professional management, indirect market exposure, potential for higher returns.\n  - **XIRR (Extended Internal Rate of Return)**:\n    - Calculates returns for **multiple transactions at different times**.\n    - Single rate that equals current value of all investments.\n- **Compound Interest**:\n  - **Rule of 72**: Time to double = `72 / interest rate`.\n  - If money doubles in 4 years, it will be **8x in 12 years** (3 doublings).\n\n#### **7. Creativity & Problem-Solving**\n- **Creative Process**:\n  1. Define problem \u2192 2. Collect info \u2192 3. Redefine problem \u2192\n  4. Generate ideas \u2192 5. Define solution \u2192 6. Evaluate feasibility \u2192\n  7. Implement.\n- **Engineering Sense**:\n  - **Abstraction**: Relating distinct concepts via common qualities.\n  - **Deductive Reasoning**: General principle \u2192 specific case (vs. inductive).\n  - **Mental Models**: Simplify complex systems (e.g., analyzing sales decline via market trends + operations).\n\n#### **8. Career Development**\n- **Career Management**:\n  - Helps employees **develop skills** for current/future roles (within/outside org).\n- **Stress & Opportunity**:\n  - Stress arises when an opportunity\u2019s outcome is **uncertain + important**.\n\n#### **9. Communication & Presentation**\n- **Effective Slides**:\n  - **Content**: Efficient, graceful, no clutter.\n  - **Design**: Use **negative space** (whitespace).\n- **Humour in Workplace**:\n  - Benefits: Team unity, persuasion, memory retention, humility, boss-employee relations, meeting engagement.\n\n---\n\n### **Key Equations (Math/Finance)**\n1. **Compound Interest (Doubling Time)**:\n   - If money doubles in `n` years, it will be `2^k` times in `k*n` years.\n   - *Example*: Doubles in 4 years \u2192 8x in 12 years (`2^3`).\n\n2. **XIRR (Excel Formula)**:\n   ```excel\n   =XIRR(values, dates, [guess])\n   ```\n   - **Values**: Cash flows (investments/redemptions).\n   - **Dates**: Corresponding transaction dates.\n\n---\n\n### **Mermaid Knowledge Graphs**\n#### **1.
