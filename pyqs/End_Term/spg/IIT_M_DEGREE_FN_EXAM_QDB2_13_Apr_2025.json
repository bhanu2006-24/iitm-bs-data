As challenges arose, team members responded differently: \nAryan, a UX designer, struggled with a new design tool but remained optimistic. He said, \u201cIf I keep practicing, I\u2019ll get better at this.\u201d \nBhabatosh, a sales associate, faced repeated client rejections. Instead of getting discouraged, she reflected, \u201cEvery rejection is a lesson. I\u2019ll analyze my mistakes and improve my pitch.\u201d \nPawan, a senior developer, actively sought feedback from colleagues, believing in continuous learning. He often said, \u201cThe more I learn from others, the better I become.\u201d \nNikitaa, however, felt demotivated after her marketing campaign failed. She sighed, \u201cI\u2019m just not cut out for this. Some people are naturally good at marketing, and I\u2019m not one of them.\u201d \n[Growth Mindset] Whose response contradicts the principles of a Growth Mindset?"

Communication & Networking**\n- **10Cs of Communication** (Select 4 for digital networking):\n  - **Clarity**: Avoid ambiguity in digital messages (e.g., LinkedIn DMs).\n  - **Conciseness**: Brevity in emails/DMs (e.g., Shashi Tharoor\u2019s post).\n  - **Courtesy**: Respect cultural norms (e.g., formal vs. informal tone).\n  - **Correctness**: Accuracy in information shared (e.g., data-driven insights).\n  - **Coherence**: Logical flow in virtual discussions.\n  - **Confidence**: Assertive yet professional tone.\n  - **Creativity**: Engaging content (e.g., storytelling in posts).\n  - **Consistency**: Regular engagement (e.g., posting updates).\n  - **Credibility**: Trustworthy sources/citations.\n  - **Context**: Tailor messages to audience (e.g., Gen-Z vs. senior professionals).\n\n- **Digital vs. Traditional Networking**:\n  - **Traditional**: Face-to-face (handshakes, conferences).\n  - **Digital**: LinkedIn DMs, comments, virtual coffee chats.\n\n---\n\n#### **2. Teamwork & Synergy**\n- **Synergy**: Combined efforts > individual outputs (e.g., Maya + Chaya\u2019s app development).\n  - **Equation**:\n    `Team Output = \u03a3(Individual Contributions) + Synergistic Effect`\n- **Types of Listening** (Harshita\u2019s example):\n  - **Active Listening**: Nodding, paraphrasing, clarifying questions, eye contact.\n  - **Passive/Selective/Superficial**: Less effective for collaboration.\n\n---\n\n#### **3. Leadership vs. Management**\n| **Tarun (Manager)**               | **Asma (Leader)**                  |\n|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| Focuses on **processes**          | Focuses on **people**              |\n| Maintains **existing systems**    | Drives **innovation**             |\n| Ensures **efficiency**            | Empowers **growth**                |\n| **Administrative** role           | **Transformational** role          |\n\n---\n\n#### **4. Emotional Intelligence (EI)**\n- **Definition**: Recognizing/managing emotions + navigating social interactions (Goleman\u2019s model).\n- **EI Constructs** (Yazad vs. Gurneet):\n  - **Self-Awareness**: Yazad\u2019s reflection on emotions/decision-making.\n  - **Empathy**: Gurneet\u2019s consideration of team emotions.\n  - **Self-Regulation**: Managing impulsive reactions.\n  - **Social Skills**: Building relationships (e.g., conflict resolution).\n  - **Motivation**: Intrinsic drive (not just external rewards).\n\n---\n\n#### **5.
