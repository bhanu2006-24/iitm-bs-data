Emotional Intelligence (EI) Models**\n#### **A. Daniel Goleman\u2019s EI Model**\n   - **5 Components**:\n     1. **Self-Awareness**: Recognizing emotions and their impact.\n     2. **Self-Regulation**: Managing disruptive emotions.\n     3. **Motivation**: Intrinsic drive to achieve goals.\n     4. **Empathy**: Understanding others' emotions.\n     5. **Social Skills**: Building relationships and managing conflicts.\n   - **Relevance in Workplace**:\n     - Improves teamwork, leadership, and conflict resolution.\n     - Enhances decision-making by balancing logic and emotion.\n\n#### **B. 6R Framework of EI**\n   - **6 Dimensions**:\n     1. **Recognize** (emotions in self/others).\n     2. **Respect** (valuing emotions).\n     3. **Reflect** (analyzing emotional triggers).\n     4. **Respond** (choosing appropriate reactions).\n     5. **Relate** (building emotional connections).\n     6. **Recharge** (managing emotional energy).\n   - **Difference from Goleman\u2019s Model**:\n     - More **action-oriented** (focus on behavior change).\n     - Explicitly includes **energy management (Recharge)**.\n\n---\n### **2. Systems Thinking**\n#### **Key Habits**\n   - **1. Recognizes systems structure generates behavior** (e.g., Nivedita\u2019s case).\n   - **2. Successive approximation** (iterative refinement, e.g., Tejas\u2019s approach).\n   - **3. Seeks the bigger picture** (holistic problem-solving).\n   - **4. Observes changes over time** (dynamic systems analysis).\n\n#### **Open vs. Closed Systems**\n   - **Open Systems**: Interact with the environment (e.g., a company adapting to market changes).\n   - **Closed Systems**: Isolated (e.g., a fixed process with no external feedback).\n   - **Defined by**: **System boundaries** (not cost/hierarchy).\n\n#### **3 Components of a System**\n   1. **Elements/parts** (e.g., team members).\n   2. **Function/purpose** (e.g., project goals).\n   3. **Interconnectedness** (e.g., communication flows).\n\n---\n### **3. Engineering Sense (Project Management & Cost Analysis)**\n#### **A. Planning Function**\n   - **Definition**: Foreseeing issues, analyzing risks, and guiding outcomes.\n   - **Key Steps**:\n     1. Risk identification.\n     2. Impact estimation.\n     3. Contingency planning.\n\n#### **B. Importance of Estimates**\n   - **5 Critical Uses**:\n     1. Support decision-making.\n     2. Determine project length/cost.\n     3. Assess project feasibility.\n     4. Develop cash flow needs.\n     5. Track progress.\n\n#### **C. Cost Analysis**\n   - **Purpose**:\n     1. Theoretical study of production costs.\n     2. Identify components for design optimization.\n\n---\n### **4. Growth Mindset vs. Fixed Mindset (Carol Dweck)**\n| **Growth Mindset**                          | **Fixed Mindset**                          |\n|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|\n| Believes abilities can be developed.       | Believes talent is innate.                |\n| Embraces challenges.                        | Avoids challenges (fear of failure).       |\n| Learns from feedback.                       | Ignores feedback.                          |\n| Inspired by others\u2019 success.               | Threatened by others\u2019 success.            |\n\n- **Key Book**: *Mindset: The New Psychology of Success*.\n- **Contradictory Statement**: *\"I\u2019m naturally not good at this, so no point trying.\"*\n\n---\n### **5. Maslow\u2019s Hierarchy of Needs (Revised)**\n- **5 Levels** (not rigid; lower needs need not be 100% fulfilled):\n  1. **Physiological** (food, water).\n  2. **Safety** (security, health).\n  3. **Love/Belonging** (relationships).\n  4. **Esteem** (respect, confidence).\n  5. **Self-Actualization** (creativity, morality).\n- **Growth Needs**: Self-esteem, creativity, problem-solving (top 3 levels).\n\n---\n### **6. Cultural Dimensions (Hofstede & Others)**\n| **Dimension**               | **Description**                                                                 | **Example**                                  |\n|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|\n| **Individualism vs. Collectivism** | Individual goals vs. group harmony.                                          | Public rewards frowned upon in Asia (Q17).  |\n| **Power Distance**          | Acceptance of hierarchy.                                                       | German structured decision-making (Q18).    |\n| **Uncertainty Avoidance**   | Tolerance for ambiguity.                                                       | Rule-based vs. flexible cultures.           |\n| **Masculinity vs. Femininity** | Competitiveness vs. cooperation.                                             | Work-life balance priorities.               |\n\n- **Cultural Synergy**: Combining strengths from diverse cultures (Q18).\n- **Acculturation**: Adjustment to a new culture (excitement \u2192 frustration \u2192 adaptation).\n\n---\n### **7. Leadership & Team Dynamics**\n#### **A. Blake & Mouton\u2019s Leadership Grid**\n   - **Axes**: Concern for **People (Y)** vs. **Production (X)**.\n   - **(1,9) Country Club Style**: High people focus, low production pressure.\n\n#### **B. Tuckman\u2019s Team Development Model**\n   - **Stages**:\n     1. **Forming** (polite, low trust).\n     2. **Storming** (conflict, **effectiveness drops**).\n     3. **Norming** (resolution, cohesion).\n     4. **Performing** (high productivity).\n\n#### **C.
