As challenges arose, team members responded differently: \nAryan, a UX designer, struggled with a new design tool but remained optimistic. He said, \u201cIf I keep practicing, I\u2019ll get better at this.\u201d \nBhabatosh, a sales associate, faced repeated client rejections. Instead of getting discouraged, she reflected, \u201cEvery rejection is a lesson. I\u2019ll analyze my mistakes and improve my pitch.\u201d \nPawan, a senior developer, actively sought feedback from colleagues, believing in continuous learning. He often said, \u201cThe more I learn from others, the better I become.\u201d \nNikitaa, however, felt demotivated after her marketing campaign failed. She sighed, \u201cI\u2019m just not cut out for this. Some people are naturally good at marketing, and I\u2019m not one of them.\u201d \n[Growth Mindset] Whose response contradicts the principles of a Growth Mindset?"

Communication & Networking**\n- **10Cs of Communication** (Select 4 for digital networking):\n  - **Clarity**: Avoid ambiguity in digital messages (e.g., LinkedIn DMs).\n  - **Conciseness**: Brevity in emails/DMs (e.g., Shashi Tharoor\u2019s post).\n  - **Correctness**: Accuracy in facts/grammar to build credibility.\n  - **Courtesy**: Politeness in virtual interactions (e.g., \"Thank you for connecting\").\n  - **Coherence**: Logical flow in digital conversations.\n  - **Confidence**: Assertive tone in professional messages.\n  - **Creativity**: Engaging content (e.g., storytelling in posts).\n  - **Consistency**: Regular updates to maintain visibility.\n  - **Completeness**: Provide all necessary details upfront.\n  - **Concreteness**: Specific examples/data to support claims.\n\n- **Digital vs. Traditional Networking**:\n  - **Traditional**: Face-to-face (handshakes, conferences).\n  - **Digital**: LinkedIn DMs, comments, virtual coffee chats.\n\n#### **2. Teamwork & Synergy**\n- **Synergy**: Combined efforts > sum of individual contributions (e.g., Maya + Chaya\u2019s app development).\n- **Active Listening** (Harshita\u2019s example):\n  - Nodding, paraphrasing, clarifying questions, eye contact.\n- **Individual Expertise vs. Collaboration**:\n  - Synergy leverages diverse strengths (e.g., UX + data analytics).\n\n#### **3. Leadership & Management**\n- **Manager vs. Leader**:\n  - **Manager (Tarun)**: Focuses on processes, efficiency, and compliance.\n  - **Leader (Asma)**: Empowers teams, drives innovation, and develops people.\n- **Emotional Intelligence (EI)**:\n  - **Self-Awareness** (Yazad): Recognizing emotions\u2019 impact on decisions.\n  - **Empathy** (Gurneet): Understanding team members\u2019 emotions.\n  - **Self-Regulation**: Managing impulses (not in options but key).\n  - **Social Skills**: Building relationships (e.g., Gurneet\u2019s support).\n\n#### **4. Cross-Cultural Strategies**\n- **Five Approaches**:\n  1. **Cultural Dominance**: Imposing one culture (e.g., U.S. company ignoring Indian norms).\n  2. **Cultural Avoidance**: Ignoring differences (e.g., Aditi\u2019s direct communication in Japan).\n  3. **Cultural Compromise**: Middle ground (e.g., Hameed\u2019s flexible remote hours).\n  4. **Cultural Accommodation**: Adapting fully (e.g., Tanuja adopting French work culture).\n  5. **Cultural Synergy**: Blending strengths from multiple cultures (not in scenarios).\n\n#### **5. Growth Mindset & Zones**\n- **Growth Mindset** (Carol Dweck):\n  - **Fixed Mindset** (Nikitaa): \"I\u2019m not cut out for this.\"\n  - **Growth Mindset** (Aryan/Bhabatosh/Pawan): \"I can improve with effort/feedback.\"\n- **False Growth Mindset** (Kamala):\n  - Praising effort without guidance or results.\n- **Four Zones of Growth**:\n  1. **Comfort Zone**: Routine tasks (Jacintha\u2019s initial state).\n  2. **Fear Zone**: Overwhelm (Jacintha\u2019s hesitation).\n  3. **Learning Zone**: Skill development (Jacintha\u2019s research/practice).\n  4. **Growth Zone**: Mastery (Jacintha\u2019s confidence post-presentation).\n\n#### **6. Maslow\u2019s Hierarchy of Needs**\n- **Levels** (Workplace Applications):\n  1. **Physiological/Safety**: Salary, job security (Sudha\u2019s struggle).\n  2. **Social**: Belonging, relationships (Sanket\u2019s disconnection).\n  3. **Esteem**: Recognition, status (Sanket\u2019s overlooked contributions).\n  4. **Self-Actualization**: Fulfillment, potential (Anupratee\u2019s entrepreneurship dream).\n\n#### **7. Systems Thinking**\n- **Core Principle**: Interdependencies > isolated parts (e.g., IT department\u2019s success reinforcing resource allocation).\n- **Archetypes**:\n  1. **Success to the Successful**: Rich get richer (IT department\u2019s resource gap).\n  2. **Shifting the Burden**: Quick fixes \u2192 long-term weakness (students using AI/shortcuts).\n  3. **Elephant and the Blind Men**: Fragmented perspectives (departments blaming each other).\n- **Other Archetypes** (Not in Qs but useful):\n  - **Fixes That Fail**: Short-term solutions worsen problems.\n  - **Limits to Growth**: Early success \u2192 later stagnation.\n\n---\n\n### **Key Equations/Frameworks (Non-Math)**\n| **Concept**               | **Framework/Definition**                                                                 |\n|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **10Cs of Communication** | Clarity, Conciseness, Correctness, Courtesy, Coherence, Confidence, Creativity, Consistency, Completeness, Concreteness. |\n| **EI Constructs**         | Self-Awareness, Self-Regulation, Motivation, Empathy, Social Skills.                   |\n| **Cross-Cultural Strategies** | Dominance \u2192 Avoidance \u2192 Compromise \u2192 Accommodation \u2192 Synergy.                      |\n| **Growth Mindset**        | Fixed: \"Talent is innate.\" Growth: \"Skills improve with effort.\"                      |\n| **Maslow\u2019s Hierarchy**    | Physiological \u2192 Safety \u2192 Social \u2192 Esteem \u2192 Self-Actualization.                          |\n| **Systems Archetypes**    | Success to the Successful, Shifting the Burden, Elephant and the Blind Men.             |\n\n---\n\n### **Mermaid Knowledge Graphs**\n#### **1.
