Maslow\u2019s Hierarchy of Needs (Workplace Alignment)**\n- **Four Stages for Exam**:\n  1. **Physiological**: Salary, office facilities.\n  2. **Safety**: Job security, health insurance.\n  3. **Belonging**: Team bonding, inclusive culture.\n  4. **Esteem**: Recognition (e.g., \"Employee of the Month\").\n  5. **Self-Actualization**: Leadership roles, skill development.\n- **Example**:\n  - A **top-tier job** fulfills:\n    - **Safety**: Stock options.\n    - **Belonging**: Diversity initiatives.\n    - **Esteem**: Promotions.\n    - **Self-Actualization**: Mentorship programs.\n\n---\n\n#### **5. Lean Teamwork**\n- **Features** (MCQ Answer: **C** \u2192 1, 2, 3):\n  1. **Job Engagement**: Employee autonomy (e.g., Google\u2019s 20% time).\n  2. **Continuous Improvement**: Kaizen (e.g., Toyota\u2019s production system).\n  3. **Resource Efficiency**: Just-in-Time inventory (e.g., Zara\u2019s supply chain).\n  - \u274c **Increases Lead Time**: Opposite of lean (lean reduces lead time).\n\n---\n\n#### **6. Conflict Resolution Styles**\n- **Accommodating Style** (MCQ Answer: **D** \u2192 Unassertive + Cooperative):\n  - **Intention**: Preserve relationships (e.g., yielding to a client\u2019s unreasonable demand to retain contract).\n\n---\n\n#### **7. Financial Literacy**\n- **Current vs. Non-Current Assets/Liabilities**:\n  - **Non-Current Asset** (MCQ Answer: **C** \u2192 Marketable securities are **current** if short-term).\n    - Land, Patents, Equipment \u2192 Non-current.\n  - **Current Liabilities** (MCQ Answer: **C** \u2192 3/4):\n    1. Payroll expenses (due <1 year).\n    2. Rent payments (short-term).\n    3. Short-term debt.\n    - \u274c Deferred tax liabilities (long-term).\n\n- **Taxation in India (2024)**:\n  - **New Tax Regime**: Default but optional (MCQ Answer: **A** \u2192 True).\n  - **PPF Returns**: Tax-exempt (MCQ Answer: **A** \u2192 True).\n\n---\n\n#### **8. Growth Mindset (Carol Dweck)**\n- **Core Idea** (MCQ Answer: **A** \u2192 True):\n  - Abilities develop through effort (e.g., Microsoft\u2019s \"learn-it-all\" culture).\n- **Cigna\u2019s Adoption** (MCQ Answer: **B** \u2192 1 & 2):\n  1. Agile response to healthcare changes.\n  2. Competitiveness via upskilling.\n  - \u274c Not about ratings-based feedback (that\u2019s **fixed mindset**).\n\n---\n\n#### **9. Systems Thinking**\n- **Leverage Points** (MCQ Answer: **C** \u2192 Small actions for big change):\n  - Example: Adjusting a thermostat (small action) to regulate room temperature (system behavior).\n- **Feedback Loops** (MCQ Answer: **D** \u2192 Negative Feedback Loop for stress management):\n  - **Negative Loop**: Stabilizes system (e.g., relaxation exercises reduce stress).\n  - **Positive Loop**: Amplifies change (e.g., viral marketing).\n- **Systems Principles** (MCQ Answer: **B** \u2192 False):\n  - Change **structure/rules**, not just events (e.g., fixing traffic jams by adding public transport, not just more cars).\n\n---\n\n#### **10. Project Management (Engineering Sense)**\n- **Accurate Estimates** (MCQ Answer: **D** \u2192 1, 2, 3):\n  1. **Scope/Cost**: Avoid budget overruns (e.g., Berlin Brandenburg Airport delays).\n  2. **Feasibility**: ROI analysis (e.g., SpaceX\u2019s reusable rockets).\n  3. **Progress Tracking**: Gantt charts (e.g., Agile sprints).\n\n---\n\n#### **11.

Health control (e.g., exercise reduces anxiety).\n  - \u274c **Avoid all stress**: Unrealistic (eustress = positive stress).\n\n---\n\n#### **12. Collaborative Leadership**\n- **Correct Statements** (MCQ Answer: **C** \u2192 1, 2, 4):\n  1. Self-leadership foundation (e.g., emotional intelligence).\n  2. Relationships + results (e.g., Satya Nadella\u2019s Microsoft turnaround).\n  4. Tools: Slack, Trello for transparency.\n  - \u274c **Avoid conflict**: Collaborative leaders **manage** conflict (e.g., constructive debates).\n\n---\n\n#### **13. Cognitive Biases (Anchoring Effect)**\n- **Definition** (MCQ Answer: **B** \u2192 2 only):\n  - Relying too heavily on initial information (e.g., first salary offer in negotiations).\n  - **Not** about expectations \u2192 That\u2019s **Pygmalion Effect**.\n\n---\n\n#### **14.
