As challenges arose, team members responded differently: \nAryan, a UX designer, struggled with a new design tool but remained optimistic. He said, \u201cIf I keep practicing, I\u2019ll get better at this.\u201d \nBhabatosh, a sales associate, faced repeated client rejections. Instead of getting discouraged, she reflected, \u201cEvery rejection is a lesson. I\u2019ll analyze my mistakes and improve my pitch.\u201d \nPawan, a senior developer, actively sought feedback from colleagues, believing in continuous learning. He often said, \u201cThe more I learn from others, the better I become.\u201d \nNikitaa, however, felt demotivated after her marketing campaign failed. She sighed, \u201cI\u2019m just not cut out for this. Some people are naturally good at marketing, and I\u2019m not one of them.\u201d \n[Growth Mindset] Whose response contradicts the principles of a Growth Mindset?"

Communication & Networking**\n#### **Key Concepts:**\n- **Digital vs. Traditional Networking**:\n  - Shift from face-to-face (e.g., handshakes, conferences) to digital (LinkedIn DMs, comments, virtual interactions).\n  - **Adaptation** is critical for professionals (e.g., Shashi Tharoor\u2019s LinkedIn post).\n- **10Cs of Communication** (Select **4 key aspects** for digital connections):\n  1. **Clarity**: Avoid ambiguity in digital messages (e.g., concise LinkedIn posts).\n  2. **Conciseness**: Brevity in emails/DMs to respect time.\n  3. **Courtesy**: Politeness in virtual interactions (e.g., thank-you notes).\n  4. **Correctness**: Accuracy in information shared (e.g., fact-checking before posting).\n  5. **Coherence**: Logical flow in digital conversations.\n  6. **Credibility**: Building trust through consistent, honest communication.\n  7. **Creativity**: Engaging content (e.g., storytelling in posts).\n  8. **Consistency**: Regular engagement (e.g., posting updates).\n  9. **Collaboration**: Two-way interaction (e.g., responding to comments).\n  10. **Cultural Sensitivity**: Adapting to global norms (e.g., avoiding jargon).\n\n#### **Application**:\n- Use the **10Cs** to build **meaningful digital relationships** (e.g., LinkedIn networking, virtual team collaboration).\n\n---\n\n### **2. Teamwork & Synergy**\n#### **Key Concepts:**\n- **Synergy**:\n  - **Definition**: Combined efforts of a team produce **greater results** than individual contributions (e.g., Maya + Chaya\u2019s app development).\n  - **Formula**:\n    ```\n    Team Output > \u03a3 (Individual Outputs)\n    ```\n- **Types of Teamwork**:\n  - **Individual Expertise**: Focus on personal skills.\n  - **Information Sharing**: Exchange of knowledge.\n  - **Synergy**: **Optimal outcome** due to collaboration.\n\n#### **Contrast with Other Options**:\n| Concept               | Description                          | Example                          |\n|-----------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| **Synergy**           | 1+1=3 (amplified results)           | Maya (UX) + Chaya (Data) \u2192 App  |\n| **Individual Expertise** | Solo contributions                  | One person handling all tasks    |\n| **Information Sharing** | Knowledge exchange without synergy   | Team meetings with no action     |\n\n---\n\n### **3. Listening Skills**\n#### **Key Concepts:**\n- **Active Listening** (Harshita\u2019s approach):\n  - **Behaviors**:\n    - Nodding, paraphrasing, asking clarifying questions.\n    - Avoiding interruptions, maintaining eye contact.\n  - **Goal**: Make the speaker feel **heard and valued**.\n- **Other Types**:\n  - **Passive**: Hearing without engagement.\n  - **Selective**: Focus only on parts of interest.\n  - **Superficial**: Pretending to listen.\n\n#### **Why Active Listening Matters**:\n- Builds **trust** and **collaboration** in teams.\n\n---\n\n### **4.

Emotional Intelligence (EI)**\n#### **Definition (Goleman\u2019s Model)**:\n- **Ability to recognize, understand, and manage**:\n  - **Own emotions** (self-awareness, self-regulation).\n  - **Others\u2019 emotions** (empathy, social skills).\n\n#### **EI Constructs**:\n| Construct       | Definition                          | Example                          |\n|-----------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| **Self-Awareness** | Recognizing one\u2019s emotions          | Yazad\u2019s reflection on decisions |\n| **Empathy**     | Understanding others\u2019 emotions      | Gurneet\u2019s team support           |\n| **Self-Regulation** | Managing emotional reactions       | Staying calm under pressure      |\n| **Social Skills** | Building relationships              | Networking, conflict resolution  |\n| **Motivation**  | Intrinsic drive to achieve          | Persistence in goals            |\n\n#### **Why EI Matters**:\n- **75% of career success** linked to EI (vs. 25% IQ).\n- Critical for **leadership**, **teamwork**, and **conflict resolution**.\n\n---\n\n### **7.
