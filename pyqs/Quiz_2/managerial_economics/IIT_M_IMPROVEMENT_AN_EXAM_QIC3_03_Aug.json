Producer surplus is the difference between the market price and the marginal cost.\n- **Equations**:\n  - Marginal Cost: \\( MC(q) = 6 + 4q \\)\n  - Producer Surplus: \\( PS = P \\times Q - \\text{Total Variable Cost} \\)\n\n#### 6. **Market Equilibrium and Taxation**\n- **Concept**: Interaction of supply and demand to determine price and quantity.\n- **Equations**:\n  - Demand: \\( P = 10 - Q \\)\n  - Supply: \\( P = Q - 4 \\)\n  - Tax incidence: \\( P_b = P_s + t \\)\n\n#### 7. **Utility Functions**\n- **Concept**: Quasi-linear utility functions have a constant marginal utility of income.\n- **Key Terms**: Indifference curves, marginal utility, monotonic transformations.\n\n#### 8. **Price Discrimination and Natural Monopoly**\n- **Concept**: Price discrimination involves charging different prices to different consumers. A natural monopoly has decreasing average costs over the range of production.\n- **Key Terms**: Perfect price discrimination, peak load pricing.\n\n### Mermaid Knowledge Graph\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[Elasticity of Demand] --> B[Price Elasticity]\n    A --> C[Market-Level Elasticity]\n    D[Monopsony] --> E[Demand for Labor]\n    D --> F[Supply of Labor]\n    G[Game Theory] --> H[Payoff Matrix]\n    G --> I[Dominant Strategies]\n    J[Monopoly] --> K[Profit Maximization]\n    J --> L[Demand Curve]\n    M[Marginal Cost] --> N[Producer Surplus]\n    O[Market Equilibrium] --> P[Demand and Supply]\n    O --> Q[Tax Incidence]\n    R[Utility Functions] --> S[Quasi-Linear Utility]\n    R --> T[Indifference Curves]\n    U[Price Discrimination] --> V[Perfect Price Discrimination]\n    U --> W[Peak Load Pricing]\n```\n\nThis knowledge graph visually maps the relationships between the core topics covered in the exam.
