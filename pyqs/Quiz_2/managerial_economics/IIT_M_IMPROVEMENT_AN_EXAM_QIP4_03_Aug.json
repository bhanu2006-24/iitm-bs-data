        "summary": "### Summary of Core Topics, Concepts, Principles, and Equations\n\n#### 1. **Elasticity of Demand**\n- **Concept**: Measures the responsiveness of the quantity demanded to a change in price.\n- **Equation**:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Price Elasticity of Demand} = \\left| \\frac{\\% \\text{ Change in Quantity Demanded}}{\\% \\text{ Change in Price}} \\right|\n  \\]\n- **Types**:\n  - **Firm-Level Elasticity**: Elasticity for a single firm (e.g., Indigo).\n  - **Market-Level Elasticity**: Elasticity for the entire market.\n\n#### 2. **Monopsony**\n- **Concept**: A market structure where there is only one buyer.\n- **Equations**:\n  - **Demand for Labor**: \\( W = 40,000 - 160n \\)\n  - **Supply of Labor**: \\( W = 2,000 + 110n \\)\n- **Key Points**:\n  - The monopsonist hires fewer workers and pays a lower wage compared to a competitive market.\n  - **Number of Nurses Hired**: 100\n  - **Wage Paid**: \u20b913,000\n\n#### 3. **Game Theory**\n- **Concept**: Study of strategic decision-making.\n- **Key Points**:\n  - **Weak Dominance**: A strategy weakly dominates another if it is at least as good in all cases and better in some.\n  - **Payoff Matrix**: Used to represent the outcomes of different strategies.\n\n#### 4. **Monopoly**\n- **Concept**: A market structure with a single seller.\n- **Equations**:\n  - **Demand Curve**: \\( Q = 53 - P \\)\n  - **Cost**: \\( AC = MC = \\$5 \\)\n- **Key Points**:\n  - **Profit-Maximizing Price**: \\( P^* = 29 \\)\n  - **Profit-Maximizing Quantity**: \\( Q^* = 24 \\)\n  - **Profit**: \u20b9576\n\n#### 5. **Competitive Firm**\n- **Concept**: A firm in a perfectly competitive market.\n- **Equations**:\n  - **Marginal Cost**: \\( MC(q) = 6 + 4q \\)\n  - **Market Price**: \u20b918\n- **Key Points**:\n  - **Output Level**: \\( q = 3 \\)\n  - **Producer Surplus**: \u20b918\n  - **Economic Profit**: Positive economic profit if \\( AVC(q) = 3 + q \\) and fixed costs are \u20b93.\n\n#### 6. **Tax and Subsidy**\n- **Concept**: Government interventions in the market.\n- **Equations**:\n  - **Demand**: \\( P = 10 - Q \\)\n  - **Supply**: \\( P = Q - 4 \\)\n- **Key Points**:\n  - **Equilibrium Quantity Before Tax**: \\( Q^* = 7 \\) (or 7,000 units)\n  - **Equilibrium Price Before Tax**: \\( P^* = 3 \\)\n  - **New Equilibrium Quantity After Tax**: \\( Q_t = 6 \\) (or 6,000 units)\n  - **Price Buyers Pay After Tax**: \\( P_B = 4 \\)\n  - **Price Sellers Receive After Tax**: \\( P_S = 2 \\)\n  - **New Equilibrium Quantity After Subsidy**: \\( Q_S = 8 \\) (or 8,000 units)\n  - **Price Buyers Pay After Subsidy**: \\( P_B = 2 \\)\n  - **Price Sellers Receive After Subsidy**: \\( P_S = 4 \\)\n  - **Total Cost to Government for Subsidy**: \u20b916,000\n\n#### 7. **Utility Functions**\n- **Concept**: Represent consumer preferences.\n- **Key Points**:\n  - **Quasi-Linear Utility**: Marginal utility of income remains constant.\n  - **Monotonic Transformation**: Does not alter the shape of indifference curves but can change marginal utility.\n\n#### 8. **Tax Incidence**\n- **Concept**: Distribution of the tax burden between buyers and sellers.\n- **Key Points**:\n  - **Elasticity of Supply**: If the price elasticity of supply is zero, the entire burden of a quantity tax falls on sellers.\n  - **Perfectly Inelastic Demand**: Consumers bear the full incidence of a per-unit tax.\n\n#### 9. **Price Discrimination**\n- **Concept**: Charging different prices to different consumers.\n- **Key Points**:\n  - **Perfect Price Discrimination**: Eliminates all deadweight loss.\n  - **Peak Load Pricing**: A form of price discrimination.\n\n#### 10. **Natural Monopoly**\n- **Concept**: A monopoly that arises due to high fixed costs and low marginal costs.\n- **Key Points**:\n  - **Long-Run Marginal Cost**: Less than long-run average cost.\n\n### Knowledge Graph \n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[Managerial Economics] --> B[Elasticity of Demand]\n    A --> C[Monopsony]\n    A --> D[Game Theory]\n    A --> E[Monopoly]\n    A --> F[Competitive Firm]\n    A --> G[Tax and Subsidy]\n    A --> H[Utility Functions]\n    A --> I[Tax Incidence]\n    A --> J[Price Discrimination]\n    A --> K[Natural Monopoly]\n\n    B --> B1[Firm-Level Elasticity]\n    B --> B2[Market-Level Elasticity]\n\n    C --> C1[Demand for Labor]\n    C --> C2[Supply of Labor]\n\n    D --> D1[Weak Dominance]\n    D --> D2[Payoff Matrix]\n\n    E --> E1[Demand Curve]\n    E --> E2[Cost]\n    E --> E3[Profit-Maximizing Price]\n    E --> E4[Profit-Maximizing Quantity]\n    E --> E5[Profit]\n\n    F --> F1[Marginal Cost]\n    F --> F2[Market Price]\n    F --> F3[Output Level]\n    F --> F4[Producer Surplus]\n    F --> F5[Economic Profit]\n\n    G --> G1[Demand]\n    G --> G2[Supply]\n    G --> G3[Equilibrium Quantity Before Tax]\n    G --> G4[Equilibrium Price Before Tax]\n    G --> G5[New Equilibrium Quantity After Tax]\n    G --> G6[Price Buyers Pay After Tax]\n    G --> G7[Price Sellers Receive After Tax]\n    G --> G8[New Equilibrium Quantity After Subsidy]\n    G --> G9[Price Buyers Pay After Subsidy]\n    G --> G10[Price Sellers Receive After Subsidy]\n    G --> G11[Total Cost to Government for Subsidy]\n\n    H --> H1[Quasi-Linear Utility]\n    H --> H2[Monotonic Transformation]\n\n    I --> I1[Elasticity of Supply]\n    I --> I2[Perfectly Inelastic Demand]\n\n    J --> J1[Perfect Price Discrimination]\n    J --> J2[Peak Load Pricing]\n\n    K --> K1[Long-Run Marginal Cost]\n```\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    B[Elasticity of Demand] --> B1[Price Elasticity of Demand]\n    B1 --> B1a[Firm-Level Elasticity]\n    B1 --> B1b[Market-Level Elasticity]\n\n    C[Monopsony] --> C1[Demand for Labor]\n    C --> C2[Supply of Labor]\n    C1 --> C1a[W = 40,000 -
