Producer surplus is the difference between the market price and the marginal cost.\n- **Equations**:\n  - Marginal Cost: \\( MC(q) = 6 + 4q \\)\n  - Producer Surplus: \\( PS = P \\times Q - \\int_0^Q MC(q) \\, dq \\)\n\n#### 6. **Market Equilibrium and Taxation**\n- **Concept**: Interaction of supply and demand to determine price and quantity.\n- **Equations**:\n  - Demand: \\( P = 10 - Q \\)\n  - Supply: \\( P = Q - 4 \\)\n  - Tax incidence: \\( P_b = P_s + t \\)\n\n#### 7. **Utility Functions**\n- **Concept**: Quasi-linear utility functions have a constant marginal utility of income.\n- **Key Terms**: Indifference curves, monotonic transformations, marginal utility.\n\n#### 8. **Price Discrimination and Natural Monopoly**\n- **Concept**: Price discrimination involves charging different prices to different consumers. A natural monopoly has decreasing average costs over the range of production.\n- **Key Terms**: Perfect price discrimination, peak load pricing.\n\n### Mermaid Knowledge Graph\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[Elasticity of Demand] --> B[Price Elasticity]\n    A --> C[Market-Level Elasticity]\n    D[Monopsony] --> E[Demand for Labor]\n    D --> F[Supply of Labor]\n    G[Game Theory] --> H[Payoff Matrix]\n    G --> I[Dominant Strategies]\n    J[Monopoly] --> K[Demand Curve]\n    J --> L[Profit Maximization]\n    M[Marginal Cost] --> N[Producer Surplus]\n    O[Market Equilibrium] --> P[Demand and Supply]\n    O --> Q[Tax Incidence]\n    R[Utility Functions] --> S[Quasi-Linear Utility]\n    R --> T[Indifference Curves]\n    U[Price Discrimination] --> V[Perfect Price Discrimination]\n    U --> W[Peak Load Pricing]\n```\n\n### Additional Mermaid Graph for Mathematical Relationships\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[Demand Curve: Q = 53 - P] --> B[Monopoly]\n    B --> C[Profit Maximization: MR = MC]\n    C --> D[Profit: \u03c0 = (P - AC) \u00d7 Q]\n    E[Marginal Cost: MC(q) = 6 + 4q] --> F[Producer Surplus]\n    G[Demand: P = 10 - Q] --> H[Market Equilibrium]\n    H --> I[Supply: P = Q - 4]\n    I --> J[Tax Incidence: P_b = P_s + t]\n```\n\nThis summary and the knowledge graphs should help you understand the core topics and their relationships for the exam.",
