        "summary": "### Summary of Core Topics, Concepts, Principles, and Equations\n\n#### 1. **Elasticity of Demand**\n- **Price Elasticity of Demand (PED):** Measures the responsiveness of the quantity demanded to a change in price.\n  - Formula: \\( E_d = \\left| \\frac{\\% \\text{ change in quantity demanded}}{\\% \\text{ change in price}} \\right| \\)\n  - For Indigo flights: \\( Q_I^d = 10000 - 100P_I + 99P_A \\)\n  - For Air India flights: \\( Q_A^d = 10000 - 100P_A + 99P_I \\)\n\n#### 2. **Monopsony**\n- **Monopsony:** A market structure where there is only one buyer.\n  - Demand for nurses: \\( W = 40,000 - 160n \\)\n  - Supply of nurses: \\( W = 2000 + 110n \\)\n  - Equilibrium condition: \\( 40,000 - 160n = 2000 + 110n \\)\n\n#### 3. **Game Theory**\n- **Dominant Strategies:** A strategy that is the best for a player no matter what the other player does.\n  - Weakly Dominates: A strategy that is at least as good as another strategy for all possible strategies of the other player.\n\n#### 4. **Monopoly**\n- **Profit Maximization:** A monopolist maximizes profit where Marginal Revenue (MR) equals Marginal Cost (MC).\n  - Demand curve: \\( Q = 53 - P \\)\n  - Cost: \\( AC = MC = \\$5 \\)\n  - Profit-maximizing condition: \\( MR = MC \\)\n\n#### 5. **Competitive Firms**\n- **Marginal Cost (MC):** The cost of producing one more unit.\n  - \\( MC(q) = 6 + 4q \\)\n  - Profit maximization condition: \\( P = MC \\)\n- **Producer Surplus:** The difference between the market price and the marginal cost.\n  - \\( \\text{Producer Surplus} = P \\times q - \\int_0^q MC(q) \\, dq \\)\n- **Economic Profit:** Total revenue minus total cost.\n  - \\( \\text{Economic Profit} = (P - AVC) \\times q - \\text{Fixed Costs} \\)\n\n#### 6. **Market Equilibrium and Taxation**\n- **Equilibrium:** The point where demand equals supply.\n  - Demand: \\( P = 10 - Q \\)\n  - Supply: \\( P = Q - 4 \\)\n- **Tax Incidence:** The effect of a tax on the price paid by buyers and the price received by sellers.\n  - Tax of \u20b92 per unit: New equilibrium condition considering tax.\n\n#### 7. **Subsidy**\n- **Subsidy:** A payment made by the government to producers to encourage production.\n  - Subsidy of \u20b92 per unit: New equilibrium condition considering subsidy.\n\n#### 8. **Utility Functions**\n- **Quasi-linear Utility Functions:** Utility functions where the marginal utility of income remains constant.\n- **Monotonic Transformation:** A transformation that preserves the order of preferences but can change the shape of indifference curves.\n\n#### 9. **Price Discrimination**\n- **Perfect Price Discrimination:** Charging each consumer the maximum price they are willing to pay.\n- **Peak Load Pricing:** Charging different prices at different times based on demand.\n\n### Knowledge Graph \n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[Managerial Economics] --> B[Elasticity of Demand];\n    A --> C[Monopsony];\n    A --> D[Game Theory];\n    A --> E[Monopoly];\n    A --> F[Competitive Firms];\n    A --> G[Market Equilibrium and Taxation];\n    A --> H[Subsidy];\n    A --> I[Utility Functions];\n    A --> J[Price Discrimination];\n\n    B --> B1[Price Elasticity of Demand];\n    B --> B2[Demand Curves];\n\n    C --> C1[Demand and Supply of Nurses];\n    C --> C2[Equilibrium Condition];\n\n    D --> D1[Dominant Strategies];\n    D --> D2[Weakly Dominates];\n\n    E --> E1[Profit Maximization];\n    E --> E2[Demand Curve];\n    E --> E3[Cost];\n\n    F --> F1[Marginal Cost];\n    F --> F2[Profit Maximization Condition];\n    F --> F3[Producer Surplus];\n    F --> F4[Economic Profit];\n\n    G --> G1[Equilibrium];\n    G --> G2[Tax Incidence];\n\n    H --> H1[Subsidy Incidence];\n\n    I --> I1[Quasi-linear Utility Functions];\n    I --> I2[Monotonic Transformation];\n\n    J --> J1[Perfect Price Discrimination];\n    J --> J2[Peak Load Pricing];\n```\n\n### Additional Knowledge Graphs for Specific Topics\n\n#### Elasticity of Demand\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    B[Elasticity of Demand] --> B1[Price Elasticity of Demand];\n    B --> B2[Demand Curves];\n    B1 --> B1a[Formula];\n    B2 --> B2a[Indigo's Demand];\n    B2 --> B2b[Air India's Demand];\n```\n\n#### Monopsony\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    C[Monopsony] --> C1[Demand and Supply of Nurses];\n    C --> C2[Equilibrium Condition];\n    C1 --> C1a[Demand Equation];\n    C1 --> C1b[Supply Equation];\n    C2 --> C2a[Equilibrium Calculation];\n```\n\n#### Game Theory\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    D[Game Theory] --> D1[Dominant Strategies];\n    D --> D2[Weakly Dominates];\n    D1 --> D1a[Strategy Analysis];\n    D2 --> D2a[Weak Dominance];\n```\n\n#### Monopoly\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    E[Monopoly] --> E1[Profit Maximization];\n    E --> E2[Demand Curve];\n    E --> E3[Cost];\n    E1 --> E1a[MR = MC];\n    E2 --> E2a[Q = 53 -
