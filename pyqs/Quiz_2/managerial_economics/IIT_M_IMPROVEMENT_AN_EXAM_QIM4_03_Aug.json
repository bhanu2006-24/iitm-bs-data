        "summary": "### Summary of Core Topics, Concepts, Principles, and Equations\n\n#### 1. **Elasticity of Demand**\n- **Concept**: Measures the responsiveness of the quantity demanded to a change in price.\n- **Equation**:\n  \\[\n  E_d = \\left| \\frac{\\% \\text{ change in quantity demanded}}{\\% \\text{ change in price}} \\right|\n  \\]\n- **Types**:\n  - **Price Elasticity of Demand for a Single Firm**: Calculated using the firm's demand curve.\n  - **Market-Level Price Elasticity of Demand**: Calculated using the market demand curve.\n\n#### 2. **Monopsony**\n- **Concept**: A market structure where there is only one buyer.\n- **Key Points**: The monopsonist will hire fewer workers and pay a lower wage compared to a competitive market.\n\n#### 3. **Game Theory**\n- **Concept**: Study of strategic decision-making.\n- **Key Points**:\n  - **Dominant Strategy**: A strategy that is the best for a player, no matter what the other players do.\n  - **Weak Dominance**: A strategy that is at least as good as another strategy, no matter what the other players do, and strictly better in some cases.\n\n#### 4. **Monopoly**\n- **Concept**: A market structure with a single seller.\n- **Key Points**:\n  - **Profit Maximization**: A monopolist maximizes profit where marginal revenue (MR) equals marginal cost (MC).\n  - **Profit Maximizing Price and Quantity**: Derived from the demand curve and cost structure.\n  - **Profit Calculation**: Profit = (Price - Average Cost) * Quantity.\n\n#### 5. **Competitive Firm**\n- **Concept**: A firm in a perfectly competitive market.\n- **Key Points**:\n  - **Profit Maximization**: A competitive firm maximizes profit where price equals marginal cost (P = MC).\n  - **Producer Surplus**: The difference between the market price and the marginal cost of production.\n  - **Economic Profit**: Total revenue minus total cost (including opportunity cost).\n\n#### 6. **Tax and Subsidy**\n- **Concept**: Government interventions in the market.\n- **Key Points**:\n  - **Tax Incidence**: The distribution of the tax burden between buyers and sellers.\n  - **Subsidy**: A payment by the government to producers or consumers to encourage production or consumption.\n  - **Equilibrium Price and Quantity**: Changes due to taxes and subsidies.\n\n#### 7. **Utility Functions**\n- **Concept**: Mathematical representations of consumer preferences.\n- **Key Points**:\n  - **Quasi-Linear Utility Functions**: Utility functions where the marginal utility of income remains constant.\n  - **Monotonic Transformation**: A transformation that preserves the order of preferences but can change the shape of indifference curves.\n  - **Marginal Utility**: The additional utility derived from consuming one more unit of a good.\n\n#### 8. **Price Discrimination**\n- **Concept**: Charging different prices to different consumers for the same product.\n- **Key Points**:\n  - **Perfect Price Discrimination**: Charging each consumer the maximum price they are willing to pay.\n  - **Peak Load Pricing**: Charging different prices based on the time of use.\n\n#### 9. **Natural Monopoly**\n- **Concept**: A monopoly that arises due to high fixed costs and low marginal costs.\n- **Key Points**: Long-run marginal cost is less than long-run average cost.\n\n### Knowledge Graph \n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[Elasticity of Demand] --> B[Price Elasticity of Demand for a Single Firm]\n    A --> C[Market-Level Price Elasticity of Demand]\n    D[Monopsony] --> E[Hiring Decisions]\n    D --> F[Wage Determination]\n    G[Game Theory] --> H[Dominant Strategy]\n    G --> I[Weak Dominance]\n    J[Monopoly] --> K[Profit Maximization]\n    J --> L[Profit Maximizing Price and Quantity]\n    J --> M[Profit Calculation]\n    N[Competitive Firm] --> O[Profit Maximization]\n    N --> P[Producer Surplus]\n    N --> Q[Economic Profit]\n    R[Tax and Subsidy] --> S[Tax Incidence]\n    R --> T[Subsidy]\n    R --> U[Equilibrium Price and Quantity]\n    V[Utility Functions] --> W[Quasi-Linear Utility Functions]\n    V --> X[Monotonic Transformation]\n    V --> Y[Marginal Utility]\n    Z[Price Discrimination] --> AA[Perfect Price Discrimination]\n    Z --> AB[Peak Load Pricing]\n    AC[Natural Monopoly] --> AD[Long-Run Marginal Cost]\n```\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[Market Structures] --> B[Monopoly]\n    A --> C[Monopsony]\n    A --> D[Competitive Firm]\n    B --> E[Profit Maximization]\n    B --> F[Price and Quantity Determination]\n    C --> G[Hiring Decisions]\n    C --> H[Wage Determination]\n    D --> I[Profit Maximization]\n    D --> J[Producer Surplus]\n    D --> K[Economic Profit]\n    L[Government Interventions] --> M[Tax]\n    L --> N[Subsidy]\n    M --> O[Tax Incidence]\n    N --> P[Subsidy Effects]\n    Q[Consumer Theory] --> R[Utility Functions]\n    Q --> S[Marginal Utility]\n    T[Price Discrimination] --> U[Perfect Price Discrimination]\n    T --> V[Peak Load Pricing]\n```\n\nThese graphs provide a visual representation of the relationships between the core topics in Managerial Economics.",
