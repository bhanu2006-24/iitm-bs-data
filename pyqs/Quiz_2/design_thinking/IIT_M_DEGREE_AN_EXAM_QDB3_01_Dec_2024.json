The core concepts revolve around qualitative methods and iterative processes.\n\n### Mermaid Knowledge Graph\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[Design Thinking Methodology] --> B[Empathize Phase];\n    A --> C[Define Phase];\n    A --> D[Ideate Phase];\n    A --> E[Prototype Phase];\n    A --> F[Test Phase];\n    B --> G[Interviews];\n    B --> H[Observations];\n    B --> I[Shadowing];\n    B --> J[Role-playing];\n    B --> K[Fly-on-the-wall research];\n    C --> L[Identify Core Problems];\n    D --> M[Creative Ideas];\n    D --> N[Potential Solutions];\n    E --> O[Prototyping];\n    F --> P[User Testing];\n    F --> Q[Feedback];\n    A --> R[Karmic Design Thinking];\n    R --> S[Empathy];\n    R --> T[Four Noble Truths];\n    R --> U[Customer Journey Mapping];\n    R --> V[Multi-Why Analysis];\n    R --> W[Conflict of Interest];\n    U --> X[Before Phase];\n    U --> Y[During Phase];\n    U --> Z[After Phase];\n    V --> AA[ENV Model];\n    A --> AB[Agile Development];\n    AB --> AC[Iterative Process];\n    AB --> AD[Flexibility];\n    A --> AE[Persona];\n    A --> AF[Customer Journey Maps];\n    AE --> AG[Demographic Details];\n    AE --> AH[Psychographic Details];\n    AF --> AI[Pain Points];\n    AF --> AJ[Areas for Improvement];\n    A --> AK[Prototyping and Testing];\n    AK --> AL[Prototyping];\n    AK --> AM[User Testing];\n    A --> AN[TRIZ];\n    AN --> AO[Contradictions];\n    AN --> AP[Inventive Principles];\n    A --> AQ[Human Factors in Design];\n    AQ --> AR[Affordances];\n    AQ --> AS[Feedback];\n    AQ --> AT[Constraints];\n```\n\nThis knowledge graph visually maps the relationships between the core topics and concepts in Design Thinking, Karmic Design Thinking, Agile Development, and related methodologies.",
