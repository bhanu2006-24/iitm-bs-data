However, understanding the iterative nature of processes and the importance of feedback loops is crucial.\n\n### Knowledge Graph \n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[Design Thinking] --> B[Empathize Phase];\n    A --> C[Define Phase];\n    A --> D[Ideate Phase];\n    A --> E[Prototype Phase];\n    A --> F[Test Phase];\n    B --> G[Interviews];\n    B --> H[Observations];\n    B --> I[Shadowing];\n    B --> J[Role-playing];\n    B --> K[Fly-on-the-wall research];\n    C --> L[Problem Identification];\n    D --> M[Creative Ideas];\n    E --> N[Prototyping];\n    F --> O[User Testing];\n    A --> P[Karmic Design Thinking];\n    P --> Q[Empathy];\n    P --> R[Four Noble Truths];\n    P --> S[Customer Journey Mapping];\n    P --> T[Multi-Why Analysis];\n    P --> U[Conflict of Interest];\n    R --> V[Dukkha];\n    R --> W[Samudaya];\n    R --> X[Nirodha];\n    R --> Y[Marga];\n    S --> Z[Before Phase];\n    S --> AA[During Phase];\n    S --> AB[After Phase];\n    U --> AC[ENV Model];\n    A --> AD[Agile Development];\n    AD --> AE[Iterative Process];\n    AD --> AF[Flexibility];\n    A --> AG[Persona];\n    A --> AH[Customer Journey Maps];\n    AG --> AI[Demographic Details];\n    AG --> AJ[Psychographic Details];\n    AH --> AK[Pain Points];\n    AH --> AL[Opportunities for Improvement];\n    A --> AM[Prototyping and Testing];\n    AM --> AN[Prototyping];\n    AM --> AO[User Testing];\n    A --> AP[TRIZ];\n    AP --> AQ[Contradictions];\n    AP --> AR[Inventive Principles];\n    A --> AS[Human Factors in Design];\n    AS --> AT[Affordances];\n    AS --> AU[Feedback];\n    AS --> AV[Constraints];\n    A --> AW[Project Management];\n    AW --> AX[Planning];\n    AW --> AY[Execution];\n    AW --> AZ[Monitoring & Evaluation];\n```\n\nThis knowledge graph visually maps the relationships between the core topics and concepts in Design Thinking, Karmic Design Thinking, Agile Development, and related methodologies.",
