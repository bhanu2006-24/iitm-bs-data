**Techniques:** User Interviews, Journey Mapping, Brainstorming, Rapid Prototyping, User Testing\n   - **Tools:** HMW (How Might We) Questions, Multi-Why Analysis, Silent Brainstorming\n\n2. **Agile Project Management:**\n   - **Principles:** Iterative development, user feedback, adaptability\n   - **Practices:** Sprints, user stories, backlog management\n\n3. **Human-Centered Design (HCD):**\n   - **Principles:** Observation, avoiding early problem specification, iterative testing\n   - **Contributions:** Customer satisfaction, brand value, environmental impact\n\n4. **User Research:**\n   - **Methods:** Surveys, interviews, focus groups, usability testing\n   - **Goals:** Understanding user needs, identifying pain points, gathering feedback\n\n5. **Prototyping and Testing:**\n   - **Types:** Low-fidelity prototypes, high-fidelity prototypes\n   - **Purposes:** Rapid experimentation, user feedback, validation of solutions\n\n6. **Conflict of Interest and Problem Framing:**\n   - **ENV Model:** Structure for identifying conflicts of interest\n   - **Problem Introduction:** IF <a parameter or variable is changed>, THEN <it solves one problem>, BUT <it worsens another situation>\n\n7. **Metrics and Measurement:**\n   - **User Retention Rate:** Percentage of users continuing to use the app\n   - **Engagement Metrics:** Time spent on the app, number of sessions, completion rates\n   - **User Feedback:** Qualitative feedback from users\n   - **Learning Outcomes:** Improvement in test scores or other learning assessments\n   - **Satisfaction Scores:** User satisfaction ratings\n\n#### Important Principles:\n\n1. **Iterative Mindset:**\n   - Embrace early failure and refine solutions through cycles of testing.\n   - Repeatedly test and improve ideas based on user feedback.\n\n2. **Empathize Phase:**\n   - Minimize assumptions and accurately uncover latent user needs.\n   - Use techniques like user interviews, observations, and journey mapping.\n\n3. **Analyze Phase:**\n   - Use Multi-Why technique to dig deeper into the root cause of a user\u2019s problem.\n   - Avoid reaching conclusions too rapidly without sufficient depth.\n\n4. **Solve Phase:**\n   - Use Silent Brainstorming to encourage individual creativity without group bias.\n   - Generate a wide range of potential solutions through ideation techniques.\n\n5. **Test Phase:**\n   - Gather user feedback to refine and validate solutions.\n   - Use low-fidelity prototypes for rapid experimentation and ideation.\n\n#### Key Equations and Metrics:\n\n1. **User Retention Rate:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{User Retention Rate} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Number of users at the end of a period}}{\\text{Number of users at the start of the period}} \\right) \\times 100\n   \\]\n\n2. **Engagement Metrics:**\n   - **Time Spent on App:** Average time spent per user session.\n   - **Number of Sessions:** Total number of user sessions over a period.\n   - **Completion Rates:** Percentage of lessons or tasks completed by users.\n\n3. **Satisfaction Scores:**\n   - **Average Rating:** Mean of user satisfaction ratings.\n   - **Net Promoter Score (NPS):** Measure of user loyalty and likelihood to recommend the app.\n\n### Mermaid Knowledge Graph\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[Design Thinking Process] --> B[Empathize]\n    A --> C[Define]\n    A --> D[Ideate]\n    A --> E[Prototype]\n    A --> F[Test]\n    B --> G[User Interviews]\n    B --> H[Observations]\n    B --> I[Journey Mapping]\n    C --> J[Multi-Why Analysis]\n    D --> K[Silent Brainstorming]\n    D --> L[HMW Questions]\n    E --> M[Low-Fidelity Prototypes]\n    E --> N[High-Fidelity Prototypes]\n    F --> O[User Feedback]\n    F --> P[Validation]\n    Q[Agile Project Management] --> R[Iterative Development]\n    Q --> S[User Feedback]\n    Q --> T[Adaptability]\n    U[Human-Centered Design] --> V[Observation]\n    U --> W[Avoid Early Problem Specification]\n    U --> X[Iterative Testing]\n    Y[User Research] --> Z[Surveys]\n    Y --> AA[Interviews]\n    Y --> AB[Focus Groups]\n    Y --> AC[Usability Testing]\n    AD[Conflict of Interest] --> AE[ENV Model]\n    AF[Metrics and Measurement] --> AG[User Retention Rate]\n    AF --> AH[Engagement Metrics]\n    AF --> AI[User Feedback]\n    AF --> AJ[Learning Outcomes]\n    AF --> AK[Satisfaction Scores]\n```\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[Empathize] --> B[User Interviews]\n    A --> C[Observations]\n    A --> D[Journey Mapping]\n    B --> E[Open-Ended Questions]\n    B --> F[Shadowing]\n    C --> G[Behavioral Insights]\n    D --> H[User Experience Patterns]\n    I[Define] --> J[Multi-Why Analysis]\n    J --> K[Root Cause Identification]\n    L[Ideate] --> M[Silent Brainstorming]\n    L --> N[HMW Questions]\n    M --> O[Individual Creativity]\n    N --> P[Problem Reframing]\n    Q[Prototype] --> R[Low-Fidelity Prototypes]\n    Q --> S[High-Fidelity Prototypes]\n    R --> T[Rapid Experimentation]\n    S --> U[Detailed Usability Testing]\n    V[Test] --> W[User Feedback]\n    V --> X[Validation]\n    Y[Agile] --> Z[Iterative Development]\n    Y --> AA[User Feedback]\n    Y --> AB[Adaptability]\n    AC[HCD] --> AD[Observation]\n    AC --> AE[Avoid Early Problem Specification]\n    AC --> AF[Iterative Testing]\n    AG[User Research] --> AH[Surveys]\n    AG --> AI[Interviews]\n    AG --> AJ[Focus Groups]\n    AG --> AK[Usability Testing]\n    AL[Conflict of Interest] --> AM[ENV Model]\n    AN[Metrics] --> AO[User Retention Rate]\n    AN --> AP[Engagement Metrics]\n    AN --> AQ[User Feedback]\n    AN --> AR[Learning Outcomes]\n    AN --> AS[Satisfaction Scores]\n```\n\nThese graphs visually map the relationships between the core topics and concepts in Design Thinking, Agile Project Management, and Human-Centered Design, providing a clear and easy-to-understand overview of the essential areas to study for the exam.",
