However, understanding the principles and processes is crucial for applying these concepts effectively.\n\n### Knowledge Graph \n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[Design Thinking Methodology] --> B[Empathize Phase];\n    A --> C[Define Phase];\n    A --> D[Ideate Phase];\n    A --> E[Prototype Phase];\n    A --> F[Test Phase];\n    B --> G[Interviews];\n    B --> H[Observations];\n    B --> I[Shadowing];\n    B --> J[Role-playing];\n    B --> K[Fly-on-the-wall research];\n    C --> L[Identify Core Problems];\n    D --> M[Generate Creative Ideas];\n    E --> N[Create Prototypes];\n    F --> O[Test Prototypes];\n    P[Karmic Design Thinking] --> Q[Empathy];\n    P --> R[Four Noble Truths];\n    P --> S[Customer Journey Mapping];\n    P --> T[Multi-Why Analysis];\n    Q --> U[Understanding User Needs];\n    R --> V[Dukkha];\n    R --> W[Samudaya];\n    R --> X[Nirodha];\n    R --> Y[Marga];\n    S --> Z[Before Phase];\n    S --> AA[During Phase];\n    S --> AB[After Phase];\n    T --> AC[Identify Root Cause];\n    AD[Agile Development] --> AE[Iterative Process];\n    AD --> AF[Flexibility];\n    AE --> AG[Frequent Feedback];\n    AF --> AH[Adapt to Changes];\n    AI[Persona and Customer Journey Maps] --> AJ[Persona];\n    AI --> AK[Customer Journey Maps];\n    AJ --> AL[Demographic Details];\n    AJ --> AM[Psychographic Details];\n    AK --> AN[Visual Representations];\n    AK --> AO[Identify Pain Points];\n    AP[Design Research] --> AQ[User Insights];\n    AP --> AR[Data Collection];\n    AQ --> AS[Beyond Designer's Intuition];\n    AR --> AT[Targeted Group of Users];\n    AU[TRIZ] --> AV[Innovation Algorithm];\n    AU --> AW[Contradictions];\n    AU --> AX[Inventive Principles];\n    AY[Human Factors in Design] --> AZ[Affordances];\n    AY --> BA[Feedback];\n    AZ --> BB[Suggest Possible Actions];\n    BA --> BC[Provide User Information];\n    BD[Project Management] --> BE[Planning];\n    BD --> BF[Execution];\n    BD --> BG[Monitoring & Evaluation];\n    BD --> BH[Unique Characteristics];\n```\n\nThis knowledge graph visually maps the relationships between the core topics and concepts in Design Thinking, Karmic Design Thinking, Agile Development, and related methodologies.",
