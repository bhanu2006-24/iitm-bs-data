However, understanding the iterative nature of processes and the importance of user feedback loops is crucial.\n\n### Knowledge Graph \n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[Design Thinking] --> B[Empathize]\n    A --> C[Define]\n    A --> D[Ideate]\n    A --> E[Prototype]\n    A --> F[Test]\n    B --> G[Interviews]\n    B --> H[Observations]\n    B --> I[Shadowing]\n    B --> J[Role-playing]\n    B --> K[Fly-on-the-wall research]\n    C --> L[Analyze]\n    D --> M[Silent Brainstorming]\n    E --> N[Prototyping]\n    F --> O[User Testing]\n    P[Karmic Design Thinking] --> Q[Four Noble Truths]\n    Q --> R[Dukkha]\n    Q --> S[Samudaya]\n    Q --> T[Nirodha]\n    Q --> U[Marga]\n    P --> V[Multi-Why Analysis]\n    W[Agile Development] --> X[Iterative Process]\n    W --> Y[User-Centric]\n    Z[Customer Journey Mapping] --> AA[Before]\n    Z --> AB[During]\n    Z --> AC[After]\n    Z --> AD[Awareness]\n    Z --> AE[Consideration]\n    Z --> AF[Decision]\n    Z --> AG[Delivery]\n    AH[Persona Development] --> AI[Demographic Details]\n    AH --> AJ[Psychographic Details]\n    AH --> AK[Goals and Motivations]\n    AL[Prototyping and Testing] --> AM[Prototyping]\n    AL --> AN[Testing]\n    AO[Conflict of Interest] --> AP[ENV Model]\n    AQ[TRIZ] --> AR[Contradictions]\n    AQ --> AS[Inventive Principles]\n    AT[Human Factors in Design] --> AU[Affordances]\n    AT --> AV[Constraints]\n```\n\nThis knowledge graph visually maps the relationships between the core topics and concepts in Design Thinking, Karmic Design Thinking, Agile Development, and related methodologies.",
