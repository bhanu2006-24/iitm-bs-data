The principles and concepts are qualitative and process-oriented.\n\n### Mermaid Knowledge Graph\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[Design Thinking] --> B[Empathize Phase]\n    A --> C[Define Phase]\n    A --> D[Ideate Phase]\n    A --> E[Prototype Phase]\n    A --> F[Test Phase]\n    B --> G[Interviews]\n    B --> H[Observations]\n    B --> I[Shadowing]\n    B --> J[Role-playing]\n    B --> K[Fly-on-the-wall research]\n    C --> L[Problem Identification]\n    D --> M[Creative Ideas]\n    E --> N[Prototype Creation]\n    F --> O[User Testing]\n    F --> P[Iteration]\n    A --> Q[Karmic Design Thinking]\n    Q --> R[Four Noble Truths]\n    Q --> S[Multi-Why Analysis]\n    Q --> T[Conflict of Interest]\n    A --> U[Agile Development]\n    U --> V[Iterative Development]\n    U --> W[User-Centric Design]\n    A --> X[Customer Journey Mapping]\n    X --> Y[Phases]\n    X --> Z[Elements]\n    X --> AA[Purpose]\n    A --> AB[Persona Development]\n    AB --> AC[Elements]\n    AB --> AD[Purpose]\n    A --> AE[Prototyping and Testing]\n    AE --> AF[Prototyping]\n    AE --> AG[Testing]\n    A --> AH[Design Research]\n    AH --> AI[Purpose]\n    A --> AJ[TRIZ]\n    AJ --> AK[Core Concepts]\n    AJ --> AL[Purpose]\n    A --> AM[Human Factors in Design]\n    AM --> AN[Affordances]\n    AM --> AO[Constraints]\n```\n\nThis knowledge graph visually maps the relationships between the core topics and concepts in Design Thinking, providing a clear and easy-to-understand overview of the essential areas to study for the exam.",
