CASE INCIDENT  User Experience of a Grocery Store  A team of IITM BS DTD-DAD students conducted in-depth interviews and observations with shoppers in the Prime Mart, a grocery store located on the IIT Madras campus, to understand their pain points and needs. They identified common issues such as long checkout lines, difficulty finding products, and confusion about pricing. The team analyzed the research findings and synthesized the information into clear problem statements. They identified the key issue as improving the checkout experience to reduce wait times and increase customer satisfaction. The team generated a variety of potential solutions through brainstorming sessions and creative exercises. They came up with ideas such as self-checkout kiosks, mobile payment options, and optimizing the layout of the store. The team created rough drafts of their ideas to test with users. They developed a mobile payment app prototype app that allowed customers to scan and pay for items as they shopped. However, they encountered some issues during the prototyping phase, such as technical glitches and difficulty integrating the app with the store\u2019s existing systems. The team tested their prototype with real users to gather feedback and identify areas for improvement. They found that the app was well-received by users and helped to reduce checkout times, but there were still some issues that needed to be addressed before implementation.",

                            "Read the case study, and answer the given subquestions.   CASE INCIDENT  User Experience of a Grocery Store  A team of IITM BS DTD-DAD students conducted in-depth interviews and observations with shoppers in the Prime Mart, a grocery store located on the IIT Madras campus, to understand their pain points and needs. They identified common issues such as long checkout lines, difficulty finding products, and confusion about pricing. The team analyzed the research findings and synthesized the information into clear problem statements. They identified the key issue as improving the checkout experience to reduce wait times and increase customer satisfaction. The team generated a variety of potential solutions through brainstorming sessions and creative exercises. They came up with ideas such as self-checkout kiosks, mobile payment options, and optimizing the layout of the store. The team created rough drafts of their ideas to test with users. They developed a mobile payment app prototype app that allowed customers to scan and pay for items as they shopped. However, they encountered some issues during the prototyping phase, such as technical glitches and difficulty integrating the app with the store\u2019s existing systems. The team tested their prototype with real users to gather feedback and identify areas for improvement. They found that the app was well-received by users and helped to reduce checkout times, but there were still some issues that needed to be addressed before implementation."
