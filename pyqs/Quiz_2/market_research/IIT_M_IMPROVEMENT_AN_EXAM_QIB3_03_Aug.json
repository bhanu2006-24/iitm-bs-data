        "summary": "### Summary of Core Topics and Concepts\n\nThe exam focuses on various aspects of market research, particularly in the context of computer-based exams. The core topics and concepts can be summarized as follows:\n\n#### Core Topics:\n1. **Study Types in Market Research**\n   - Brand Health\n   - Customer Satisfaction (Customer Sat)\n   - Ad Pretesting\n   - Product Testing\n   - Concept Testing\n   - Employee Satisfaction (Employee Sat)\n   - Channel Satisfaction (Channel Sat)\n\n2. **Key Metrics and Measures**\n   - Unaided Awareness\n   - Net Promoter Score (NPS)\n   - Willingness to Continue with the Brand\n   - Satisfaction Mean Score\n   - Persuasion in Ad Pretesting\n   - Employee Satisfaction Index\n\n3. **True/False Statements**\n   - Understanding the validity of statements related to market research concepts.\n\n4. **Data Analysis**\n   - Calculating mean scores\n   - Understanding and interpreting data tables\n   - Calculating Net Promoter Score (NPS)\n\n#### Important Concepts and Principles:\n1. **Unaided Awareness vs. Consideration Set**\n   - Unaided awareness refers to brands that consumers can recall without prompting.\n   - The consideration set is the list of brands consumers consider before making a purchase.\n\n2. **Consumer Involvement**\n   - Level of consumer involvement pertains to the category as a whole and not to specific brands.\n\n3. **Ad Pretesting**\n   - Ensures that media money is not wasted on ineffective ads.\n   - Persuasion is a key metric in ad pretesting.\n\n4. **Blind Product Testing**\n   - Ensures that brand name does not influence the respondent\u2019s feedback.\n\n5. **Retailer Satisfaction Studies**\n   - Commercial terms are included in the questionnaire.\n\n6. **Employee Satisfaction**\n   - Willingness to refer friends to the company is a good sign of high employee satisfaction.\n\n#### Equations:\n1. **Employee Satisfaction Index Calculation**\n   - Take the mathematical average of the three questions (Overall Satisfaction, Willingness to Recommend, Intention to Continue).\n   - Convert the average to a scale of zero to 100.\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Employee Satisfaction Index} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Overall Satisfaction} + \\text{Willingness to Recommend} + \\text{Intention to Continue}}{3} \\right) \\times 10\n   \\]\n\n2. **Net Promoter Score (NPS) Calculation**\n   - NPS is calculated by subtracting the percentage of detractors from the percentage of promoters.\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{NPS} = \\text{Percentage of Promoters} - \\text{Percentage of Detractors}\n   \\]\n\n### Knowledge Graph \n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[Market Research] --> B[Study Types];\n    A --> C[Key Metrics and Measures];\n    A --> D[True/False Statements];\n    A --> E[Data Analysis];\n\n    B --> B1[Brand Health];\n    B --> B2[Customer Satisfaction];\n    B --> B3[Ad Pretesting];\n    B --> B4[Product Testing];\n    B --> B5[Concept Testing];\n    B --> B6[Employee Satisfaction];\n    B --> B7[Channel Satisfaction];\n\n    C --> C1[Unaided Awareness];\n    C --> C2[Net Promoter Score];\n    C --> C3[Willingness to Continue with the Brand];\n    C --> C4[Satisfaction Mean Score];\n    C --> C5[Persuasion in Ad Pretesting];\n    C --> C6[Employee Satisfaction Index];\n\n    D --> D1[Unaided Awareness vs. Consideration Set];\n    D --> D2[Consumer Involvement];\n    D --> D3[Ad Pretesting];\n    D --> D4[Blind Product Testing];\n    D --> D5[Retailer Satisfaction Studies];\n    D --> D6[Employee Satisfaction];\n\n    E --> E1[Calculating Mean Scores];\n    E --> E2[Interpreting Data Tables];\n    E --> E3[Calculating Net Promoter Score];\n```\n\nThis knowledge graph visually maps the relationships between the core topics in market research, making it easier to understand the connections and flow of concepts.",
