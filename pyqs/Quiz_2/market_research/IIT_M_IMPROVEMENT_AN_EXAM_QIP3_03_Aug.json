        "summary": "### Summary of Core Topics and Concepts\n\nThe exam focuses on various aspects of market research, particularly in the context of computer-based exams. The core topics and concepts can be summarized as follows:\n\n#### Core Topics:\n1. **Study Types in Market Research**\n   - **Brand Health**\n   - **Customer Satisfaction (Customer Sat)**\n   - **Ad Pretesting**\n   - **Product Testing**\n   - **Concept Testing**\n   - **Employee Satisfaction (Employee Sat)**\n   - **Channel Satisfaction (Channel Sat)**\n\n2. **Key Metrics and Measures**\n   - **Unaided Awareness**\n   - **Net Promoter Score (NPS)**\n   - **Willingness to Continue with the Brand**\n   - **Satisfaction Mean Score**\n   - **Persuasion in Ad Pretesting**\n   - **Employee Satisfaction Index**\n\n3. **True/False Statements**\n   - Understanding the validity of statements related to market research concepts.\n\n4. **Data Analysis**\n   - Calculating mean scores, NPS, and other metrics from given data sets.\n\n#### Important Concepts and Principles:\n- **Unaided Awareness vs. Consideration Set**: Unaided awareness is not always the same as the list of brands consumers consider before buying.\n- **Consumer Involvement**: Pertains to the category as a whole and not to specific brands.\n- **Brand Awareness and Purchase**: Consumers may buy a brand even if they are not aware of it at the unaided level.\n- **NPS and Brand Continuation**: A high degree of correlation is expected between NPS and the intention to continue with the brand.\n- **Ad Pretesting**: Ensures that media money is not wasted on ineffective ads.\n- **Blind Product Testing**: Ensures that brand name does not influence the respondent\u2019s feedback.\n- **Retailer Satisfaction Studies**: Include commercial terms in the questionnaire.\n- **Employee Satisfaction**: Willingness to refer friends to the company is a good sign of high employee satisfaction.\n- **Ad Recall and Brand Awareness**: Total ad recall can never be higher than total brand awareness.\n\n#### Equations:\n1. **Employee Satisfaction Index Calculation**:\n   - Take the mathematical average of the three questions.\n   - Convert it to a scale of zero to 100.\n   - Formula: \\( \\text{Employee Satisfaction Index} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Overall Satisfaction} + \\text{Willingness to Recommend} + \\text{Intention to Continue}}{3} \\right) \\times 10 \\)\n\n2. **Net Promoter Score (NPS) Calculation**:\n   - NPS = Percentage of Promoters - Percentage of Detractors\n\n### Knowledge Graph \n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[Market Research] --> B[Study Types]\n    A --> C[Key Metrics]\n    A --> D[True/False Statements]\n    A --> E[Data Analysis]\n\n    B --> B1[Brand Health]\n    B --> B2[Customer Satisfaction]\n    B --> B3[Ad Pretesting]\n    B --> B4[Product Testing]\n    B --> B5[Concept Testing]\n    B --> B6[Employee Satisfaction]\n    B --> B7[Channel Satisfaction]\n\n    C --> C1[Unaided Awareness]\n    C --> C2[Net Promoter Score]\n    C --> C3[Willingness to Continue]\n    C --> C4[Satisfaction Mean Score]\n    C --> C5[Persuasion]\n    C --> C6[Employee Satisfaction Index]\n\n    D --> D1[Unaided Awareness vs. Consideration Set]\n    D --> D2[Consumer Involvement]\n    D --> D3[Brand Awareness and Purchase]\n    D --> D4[NPS and Brand Continuation]\n    D --> D5[Ad Pretesting]\n    D --> D6[Blind Product Testing]\n    D --> D7[Retailer Satisfaction Studies]\n    D --> D8[Employee Satisfaction]\n    D --> D9[Ad Recall and Brand Awareness]\n\n    E --> E1[Mean Scores]\n    E --> E2[NPS Calculation]\n    E --> E3[Employee Satisfaction Index Calculation]\n```\n\nThis knowledge graph visually maps the relationships between the core topics in market research, providing a clear and easy-to-understand overview of the subject matter.",
