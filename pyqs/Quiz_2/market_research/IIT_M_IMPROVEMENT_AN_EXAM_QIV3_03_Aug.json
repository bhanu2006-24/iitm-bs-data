        "summary": "### Summary of Core Topics and Concepts\n\nThe exam focuses on various aspects of market research, particularly in the context of computer-based exams. The core topics and concepts can be summarized as follows:\n\n#### Core Topics:\n1. **Study Types in Market Research**\n   - Brand Health\n   - Customer Satisfaction (Customer Sat)\n   - Ad Pretesting\n   - Product Testing\n   - Concept Testing\n   - Employee Satisfaction (Employee Sat)\n   - Channel Satisfaction (Channel Sat)\n\n2. **Key Metrics and Measures**\n   - Unaided Awareness\n   - Net Promoter Score (NPS)\n   - Willingness to Continue with the Brand\n   - Satisfaction Mean Score\n   - Persuasion in Ad Pretesting\n   - Employee Satisfaction Index\n\n3. **True/False Statements**\n   - Understanding the validity of statements related to market research concepts.\n\n4. **Data Analysis**\n   - Calculating mean scores\n   - Understanding and interpreting data tables\n   - Calculating Net Promoter Score (NPS)\n\n#### Important Concepts and Principles:\n1. **Unaided Awareness vs. Consideration Set**\n   - Unaided awareness is not always the same as the list of brands consumers consider before buying.\n\n2. **Consumer Involvement**\n   - Level of consumer involvement pertains to the category as a whole and not to specific brands.\n\n3. **Brand Awareness and Purchase**\n   - Consumers may buy a brand even if they are not aware of it at the unaided level.\n\n4. **Correlation Between NPS and Brand Continuation**\n   - A high degree of correlation is expected between NPS and the intention to continue with the brand.\n\n5. **Ad Pretesting**\n   - Pretesting a finished ad ensures that media money is not wasted on an ineffective ad.\n   - Persuasion is a key metric in ad pretesting.\n\n6. **Blind Product Testing**\n   - Ensures that the brand name does not influence the respondent\u2019s feedback.\n\n7. **Retailer Satisfaction Studies**\n   - Commercial terms are included in the questionnaire.\n\n8. **Employee Satisfaction**\n   - Employees willing to refer friends to the company indicate high employee satisfaction.\n\n9. **Ad Recall and Brand Awareness**\n   - Total ad recall can never be higher than total brand awareness.\n\n#### Equations:\n1. **Employee Satisfaction Index Calculation**\n   - Take the mathematical average of the three questions.\n   - Convert it to a scale of zero to 100.\n   - Formula: \\( \\text{Employee Satisfaction Index} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Overall Satisfaction} + \\text{Willingness to Recommend} + \\text{Intention to Continue}}{3} \\right) \\times 10 \\)\n\n2. **Net Promoter Score (NPS) Calculation**\n   - NPS = Percentage of Promoters - Percentage of Detractors\n\n### Knowledge Graph \n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[Market Research] --> B[Study Types];\n    A --> C[Key Metrics and Measures];\n    A --> D[True/False Statements];\n    A --> E[Data Analysis];\n\n    B --> B1[Brand Health];\n    B --> B2[Customer Satisfaction];\n    B --> B3[Ad Pretesting];\n    B --> B4[Product Testing];\n    B --> B5[Concept Testing];\n    B --> B6[Employee Satisfaction];\n    B --> B7[Channel Satisfaction];\n\n    C --> C1[Unaided Awareness];\n    C --> C2[Net Promoter Score];\n    C --> C3[Willingness to Continue with the Brand];\n    C --> C4[Satisfaction Mean Score];\n    C --> C5[Persuasion in Ad Pretesting];\n    C --> C6[Employee Satisfaction Index];\n\n    D --> D1[Unaided Awareness vs. Consideration Set];\n    D --> D2[Consumer Involvement];\n    D --> D3[Brand Awareness and Purchase];\n    D --> D4[Correlation Between NPS and Brand Continuation];\n    D --> D5[Ad Pretesting];\n    D --> D6[Blind Product Testing];\n    D --> D7[Retailer Satisfaction Studies];\n    D --> D8[Employee Satisfaction];\n    D --> D9[Ad Recall and Brand Awareness];\n\n    E --> E1[Calculating Mean Scores];\n    E --> E2[Interpreting Data Tables];\n    E --> E3[Calculating Net Promoter Score];\n```\n\nThis knowledge graph visually maps the relationships between the core topics in market research, providing a clear and easy-to-understand overview of the essential concepts for the exam.",
