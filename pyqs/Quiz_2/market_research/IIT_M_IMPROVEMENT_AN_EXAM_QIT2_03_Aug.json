        "summary": "### Summary of Core Topics, Concepts, Principles, and Equations\n\n#### Core Topics and Concepts\n\n1. **Market Research Types**\n   - **Brand Health**: Measures the quality perception of brands.\n   - **Customer Satisfaction (Customer Sat)**: Evaluates how likely customers are to recommend a product or service.\n   - **Ad Pretesting**: Assesses the effectiveness and appeal of advertisements before they are released.\n   - **Product Testing**: Evaluates the liking and acceptance of new product offerings.\n   - **Concept Testing**: Determines the relevance and differentiation of new product concepts.\n   - **Employee Satisfaction (Employee Sat)**: Measures the satisfaction and engagement of employees within an organization.\n   - **Channel Satisfaction (Channel Sat)**: Assesses the satisfaction of retailers and distributors with the service provided by the company.\n\n2. **Key Metrics and Measures**\n   - **Unaided Awareness**: The brands that consumers recall without prompting.\n   - **Net Promoter Score (NPS)**: A metric used to gauge the loyalty of a firm's customer relationships.\n   - **Willingness to Continue**: Measures the likelihood of customers continuing to use a brand.\n   - **Satisfaction Mean Score**: Average score of customer or employee satisfaction on a given scale.\n   - **Persuasion**: A key metric in ad pretesting to measure the effectiveness of an ad.\n\n3. **Important Principles**\n   - **Blind Product Testing**: Ensures that brand name does not influence respondent feedback.\n   - **Employee Referral**: Indicates high employee satisfaction if employees are willing to refer friends to the company.\n   - **Ad Recall and Brand Awareness**: Total ad recall can never be higher than total brand awareness.\n   - **Consumer Involvement**: Pertains to the category as a whole and not to specific brands.\n\n#### Equations\n\n1. **Employee Satisfaction Index**\n   - **Step 1**: Calculate the mathematical average of the three questions (Overall Satisfaction, Willingness to Recommend, Intention to Continue).\n     \\[\n     \\text{Average} = \\frac{\\text{Overall Satisfaction} + \\text{Willingness to Recommend} + \\text{Intention to Continue}}{3}\n     \\]\n   - **Step 2**: Convert the average to a scale of zero to 100.\n     \\[\n     \\text{Employee Satisfaction Index} = \\text{Average} \\times 10\n     \\]\n\n2. **Net Promoter Score (NPS)**\n   - **Calculation**: NPS is calculated by subtracting the percentage of detractors from the percentage of promoters.\n     \\[\n     \\text{NPS} = \\text{Percentage of Promoters} - \\text{Percentage of Detractors}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Mean Score Calculation**\n   - **Calculation**: The mean score is calculated by summing all the scores and dividing by the number of respondents.\n     \\[\n     \\text{Mean Score} = \\frac{\\sum \\text{Scores}}{\\text{Number of Respondents}}\n     \\]\n\n### Mermaid Knowledge Graph\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[Market Research] --> B[Brand Health]\n    A --> C[Customer Satisfaction]\n    A --> D[Ad Pretesting]\n    A --> E[Product Testing]\n    A --> F[Concept Testing]\n    A --> G[Employee Satisfaction]\n    A --> H[Channel Satisfaction]\n    B --> I[Unaided Awareness]\n    C --> J[Net Promoter Score]\n    C --> K[Willingness to Continue]\n    D --> L[Persuasion]\n    G --> M[Employee Referral]\n    G --> N[Employee Satisfaction Index]\n    A --> O[Blind Product Testing]\n    A --> P[Ad Recall and Brand Awareness]\n    A --> Q[Consumer Involvement]\n```\n\nThis summary and knowledge graph should help you understand the core topics, concepts, principles, and equations essential for the exam on Market Research.",
