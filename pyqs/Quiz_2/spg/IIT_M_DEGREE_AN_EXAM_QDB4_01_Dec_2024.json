Select the solution(s) you believe is/are the most effective approach for the given scenario. In your response, clearly explain why you think this solution is best suited, using relevant theories, frameworks, or best practices in the workplace dynamics. You must include concepts related to effective teamwork/ communication/ leadership/ emotional intelligence/ conflict management to support your reasoning.  [Case] Jalaj has recently been promoted to supervisor of his group. He got along well with everyone in the group and had a few close friends in the group, including Ciril. Six months into Jalaj\u2019s tenure as supervisor, Ciril told him that Gayathri has started complaining that Jalaj was playing favourites and giving the best and most interesting assignments to his friends, leaving her and the other \u201coutsiders\u201d with the routine jobs that would not help them become more promotable. Gayathri apparently was threatening to go to Jalaj\u2019s boss to complain about his unfair and arbitrary project assignments. \nWhat should Jalaj do? \nA. Ask Ciril to keep an eye on the situation and report to him about anything Gayathri says about his management style. \nB. Speak to Gayathri directly, tell her what Ciril said, and ask her to explain herself. \nC. Call a meeting of the entire group and ask for feedback on his management style, then, work to improve his relationships with all of his employees. \nD. Make sure that Gayathri gets her choice of assignments when the next set of projects opens up. \nE. Pre-empt any complaint by Gayathri by going to his supervisor now, explaining the situation and asking for advice on how to handle it. \nAnswer in (150-250 words) Guidelines: Choose the option(s) and justify your response with frameworks, theories, reasons or suitable examples.",

                        "Review the case provided and consider the five possible solutions listed. Select the solution(s) you believe is/are the most effective approach for the given scenario. In your response, clearly explain why you think this solution is best suited, using relevant theories, frameworks, or best practices in the workplace dynamics. You must include concepts related to effective teamwork/ communication/ leadership/ emotional intelligence/ conflict management to support your reasoning.  [Case] Jalaj has recently been promoted to supervisor of his group. He got along well with everyone in the group and had a few close friends in the group, including Ciril. Six months into Jalaj\u2019s tenure as supervisor, Ciril told him that Gayathri has started complaining that Jalaj was playing favourites and giving the best and most interesting assignments to his friends, leaving her and the other \u201coutsiders\u201d with the routine jobs that would not help them become more promotable. Gayathri apparently was threatening to go to Jalaj\u2019s boss to complain about his unfair and arbitrary project assignments. \nWhat should Jalaj do? \nA. Ask Ciril to keep an eye on the situation and report to him about anything Gayathri says about his management style. \nB. Speak to Gayathri directly, tell her what Ciril said, and ask her to explain herself. \nC. Call a meeting of the entire group and ask for feedback on his management style, then, work to improve his relationships with all of his employees. \nD. Make sure that Gayathri gets her choice of assignments when the next set of projects opens up. \nE. Pre-empt any complaint by Gayathri by going to his supervisor now, explaining the situation and asking for advice on how to handle it. \nAnswer in (150-250 words) Guidelines: Choose the option(s) and justify your response with frameworks, theories, reasons or suitable examples."
