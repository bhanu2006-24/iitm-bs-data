Ensure that your responses are supported with relevant content from the course and the case study.  Case Summary:  Part (A) - Early Career, from Student to Manager:   Carrie joins a large multinational as a summer student, then works part-time while finishing her undergraduate degree in history. Upon graduation, she takes a job in the budget but fully expects to pursue a graduate degree. After six months, Jim, an Executive Director, takes an interest in Carrie and she is promoted to manager, working for an extremely difficult boss named Edith. The case details several aspects of Carrie\u2019s first experiences as manager: - her difficulties with Edith, her direct supervisor, who is disliked by Carrie and her team and how Carrie deals with - and avoids this problem; - Carrie\u2019s increasing investment in her work, her inability to say no to requests from higher-ups and her development of an informal network within the company; - how she manager her 10-employee team, in particular, how she evaluates their performance; - how Carrie compensates for her lack of technical knowledge (finance, budgeting) and still manages to succeed in this management position.  Part (B) - Towards Senior Management:   Carrie climbs several management levels up to the position of Executive Director. - her first steps as Regional Director of Sales (at 32) and how she wins the support of the displaced \u2018heir apparent\u2019 to the job; - her promotion to Executive Director of Customer Services (at 38), coinciding with the beginning of a part-time MBA, and how she improves the performance of this underperforming division by accumulating a series of \u2018small successes\u2019; - Her appointment (at 44) as head of a major strategic initiative (a logistic service for businesses), despite her reluctance to accept this position. It is a high, high-visibility project and Carrie has to develop relationships with the powerful steering committee. Case describes, how she confronts Indra, the VP Marketing, at a steering committee meeting, and how Carrie decides to experiment with a new sales approach without the prior approval of committee.  [Carrie Wagner] Evaluate Carrie\u2019s path to leadership using Daniel Goleman\u2019s Emotional Intelligence framework. (Answer in 100-150 words) Hint: Mention 4 constructs of the EI framework",

Ensure that your responses are supported with relevant content from the course and the case study.  Case Summary:  Part (A) - Early Career, from Student to Manager:   Carrie joins a large multinational as a summer student, then works part-time while finishing her undergraduate degree in history. Upon graduation, she takes a job in the budget but fully expects to pursue a graduate degree. After six months, Jim, an Executive Director, takes an interest in Carrie and she is promoted to manager, working for an extremely difficult boss named Edith. The case details several aspects of Carrie\u2019s first experiences as manager: - her difficulties with Edith, her direct supervisor, who is disliked by Carrie and her team and how Carrie deals with - and avoids this problem; - Carrie\u2019s increasing investment in her work, her inability to say no to requests from higher-ups and her development of an informal network within the company; - how she manager her 10-employee team, in particular, how she evaluates their performance; - how Carrie compensates for her lack of technical knowledge (finance, budgeting) and still manages to succeed in this management position.  Part (B) - Towards Senior Management:   Carrie climbs several management levels up to the position of Executive Director. - her first steps as Regional Director of Sales (at 32) and how she wins the support of the displaced \u2018heir apparent\u2019 to the job; - her promotion to Executive Director of Customer Services (at 38), coinciding with the beginning of a part-time MBA, and how she improves the performance of this underperforming division by accumulating a series of \u2018small successes\u2019; - Her appointment (at 44) as head of a major strategic initiative (a logistic service for businesses), despite her reluctance to accept this position. It is a high, high-visibility project and Carrie has to develop relationships with the powerful steering committee. Case describes, how she confronts Indra, the VP Marketing, at a steering committee meeting, and how Carrie decides to experiment with a new sales approach without the prior approval of committee.  [Carrie Wagner] Evaluate Carrie\u2019s path to leadership using Daniel Goleman\u2019s Emotional Intelligence framework. (Answer in 100-150 words) Hint: Mention 4 constructs of the EI framework"
