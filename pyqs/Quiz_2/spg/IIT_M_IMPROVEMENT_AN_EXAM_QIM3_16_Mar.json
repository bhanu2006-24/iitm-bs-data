Within 16 months, he was transferred to another group and promoted to the position of supervisor. About a third of Dhruv\u2019s direct reports were 10 or more years older than he was, and they seemed less than pleased when he was introduced as their new supervisor. While he was able to build respectful and supportive relationships with many of the younger employees, the older group remained aloof. Four months into his new job, Dhruv was informed that his group would be upgraded to a new project management and database system and was asked to send all his employees to training. Dhruv took the training himself first, and then asked his employees to sign up for the time slots that would be the most convenient for them. Members of the older group of employees were the last to sign up, saying they were in the middle of a busy season for their clients, and couldn\u2019t take the time. Then, the trainer complained to Dhruv that his employees had not paid much attention during the training, instead responding to emails on their smartphones or stepping out to take client calls. After the training, the older group of workers complained that the new system was ineffective and inferior to the old one. One person, Narendran, spoke the loudest and made the most complaints, explaining that he was speaking for the entire group of \u201cseasoned veterans who really know what makes this business run.\u201d \nWhat should Dhruv do? \nA. Speak to Narendran privately about his obstructiveness, and warn him that if he doesn\u2019t cooperate by learning and using the new system, he will receive a written warning. \nB. Do nothing about Narendran\u2019s complaints; over time, he and the other veterans will have to learn the system if they want to get good appraisals, raises and bonuses. \nC. Call a meeting of the entire group and ask for feedback on the new system. Identify those individuals who are most technologically savvy and develop a plan together for getting everyone up to speed on all of the features and functions of the new system. \nD. Speak to Narendran in front of the group of seasoned veterans. Explain that he appreciates Narendran\u2019s views and would like the entire group to get together regularly to exchange information and knowledge across all of the employees in the work group. \nE. Get advice from his own supervisor regarding how to proceed with managing the different personalities and perspectives among his employees and how to best implement the changeover.

You must include concepts related to effective teamwork/ communication/ leadership/ emotional intelligence/ conflict management to support your reasoning. \n[Case] When he graduated with his honours undergraduate degree in business, Dhruv was hired as a marketing associate for a large consumer products firm. Within 16 months, he was transferred to another group and promoted to the position of supervisor. About a third of Dhruv\u2019s direct reports were 10 or more years older than he was, and they seemed less than pleased when he was introduced as their new supervisor. While he was able to build respectful and supportive relationships with many of the younger employees, the older group remained aloof. Four months into his new job, Dhruv was informed that his group would be upgraded to a new project management and database system and was asked to send all his employees to training. Dhruv took the training himself first, and then asked his employees to sign up for the time slots that would be the most convenient for them. Members of the older group of employees were the last to sign up, saying they were in the middle of a busy season for their clients, and couldn\u2019t take the time. Then, the trainer complained to Dhruv that his employees had not paid much attention during the training, instead responding to emails on their smartphones or stepping out to take client calls. After the training, the older group of workers complained that the new system was ineffective and inferior to the old one. One person, Narendran, spoke the loudest and made the most complaints, explaining that he was speaking for the entire group of \u201cseasoned veterans who really know what makes this business run.\u201d \nWhat should Dhruv do? \nA. Speak to Narendran privately about his obstructiveness, and warn him that if he doesn\u2019t cooperate by learning and using the new system, he will receive a written warning. \nB. Do nothing about Narendran\u2019s complaints; over time, he and the other veterans will have to learn the system if they want to get good appraisals, raises and bonuses. \nC. Call a meeting of the entire group and ask for feedback on the new system. Identify those individuals who are most technologically savvy and develop a plan together for getting everyone up to speed on all of the features and functions of the new system. \nD. Speak to Narendran in front of the group of seasoned veterans. Explain that he appreciates Narendran\u2019s views and would like the entire group to get together regularly to exchange information and knowledge across all of the employees in the work group. \nE. Get advice from his own supervisor regarding how to proceed with managing the different personalities and perspectives among his employees and how to best implement the changeover.

                        "[Investment Strategy] Jayandra and Karan both were software engineers and earned a decent salary. \nJayandra started investing in the Sensex index at the age of 25. Each month, he invested \u20b95000, accumulating a total investment of \u20b926,80,000. By the time he stopped investing, his portfolio had grown to an impressive \u20b920,75,17,690. \nOn the other hand, Karan began investing at the age of 35 and continued till 01-02-2024 in the same Sensex index. Despite making the same monthly investment as Jayandra, his total investment amounted to \u20b920,80,000. However, the return he received was significantly lower at \u20b93,16,41,127. \n[Investment Strategy] What was the primary reason for Jayandra accumulating significantly higher wealth than Karan?"
