Ms. Lee said, \u201cFine. I quit. Do it yourself.\u201d Ms. Lee is the senior project manager and is in charge of completing a customized training program for the firm\u2019s largest client. Jack was hired from the outside just two months ago as vice president of training. Ms. Lee believes that her credentials are more appropriate and impressive than are Jack\u2019s. Ms. Lee expected the job. She has no alternatives lined up. Jack has already earned a reputation for being harsh in a place where people formerly enjoyed working. The particular project in question includes extensive material/course manual preparation as well as classroom sessions. Before the interruption, Ms. Lee was attempting to communicate to Jack that the client had requested a significant variation from what was originally contracted.
