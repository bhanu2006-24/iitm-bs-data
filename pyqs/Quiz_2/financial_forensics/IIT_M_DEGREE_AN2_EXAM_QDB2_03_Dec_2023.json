**Equation**:\n     \\[\n     NPV = \\sum_{t=1}^{n} \\frac{CF_t}{(1 + r)^t} - Initial Investment\n     \\]\n     where \\( CF_t \\) is the cash flow at time \\( t \\), \\( r \\) is the discount rate, and \\( n \\) is the number of periods.\n\n2. **Debt Equity Ratio and Times Interest Earned**\n   - **Concept**: These ratios are used to assess a company's financial leverage and ability to meet its debt obligations.\n   - **Equations**:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Debt Equity Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Debt}}{\\text{Total Equity}}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     \\text{Times Interest Earned} = \\frac{\\text{Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT)}}{\\text{Interest Expense}}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Price-Earnings (PE) Ratio**\n   - **Concept**: The PE ratio is used to evaluate the relative value of a company's shares.\n   - **Equation**:\n     \\[\n     \\text{PE Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Market Price per Share}}{\\text{Earnings per Share (EPS)}}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Inventory Turnover Ratio**\n   - **Concept**: This ratio measures how efficiently a company manages its inventory.\n   - **Equation**:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)}}{\\text{Average Inventory}}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Return on Assets (ROA)**\n   - **Concept**: ROA measures how efficiently a company uses its assets to generate profit.\n   - **Equation**:\n     \\[\n     \\text{ROA} = \\frac{\\text{Net Income}}{\\text{Average Total Assets}}\n     \\]\n\n6. **Return on Equity (ROE)**\n   - **Concept**: ROE measures a company's profitability by revealing how much profit a company generates with the money shareholders have invested.\n   - **Equation**:\n     \\[\n     \\text{ROE} = \\frac{\\text{Net Income}}{\\text{Shareholders' Equity}}\n     \\]\n\n7. **Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)**\n   - **Concept**: CAPM is used to determine the expected return on an investment based on its risk.\n   - **Equation**:\n     \\[\n     E(R_i) = R_f + \\beta_i (E(R_m) - R_f)\n     \\]\n     where \\( E(R_i) \\) is the expected return on the investment, \\( R_f \\) is the risk-free rate, \\( \\beta_i \\) is the beta of the investment, and \\( E(R_m) \\) is the expected return of the market.\n\n8. **Annuity and Perpetuity**\n   - **Concept**: Annuities and perpetuities are used to calculate the present value of a series of future payments.\n   - **Equations**:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Present Value of an Annuity} = P \\times \\frac{1 - (1 + r)^{-n}}{r}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     \\text{Present Value of a Perpetuity} = \\frac{P}{r}\n     \\]\n     where \\( P \\) is the payment amount, \\( r \\) is the discount rate, and \\( n \\) is the number of periods.\n\n9. **Rollback and Roll Forward Rates**\n   - **Concept**: These rates are used to assess the transition of delinquency statuses over time.\n   - **Equations**:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Rollback Rate} = \\frac{\\text{Number of accounts that improved}}{\\text{Total number of accounts in the initial delinquency status}}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     \\text{Roll Forward Rate} = \\frac{\\text{Number of accounts that worsened}}{\\text{Total number of accounts in the initial delinquency status}}\n     \\]\n\n10. **Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC)**\n    - **Concept**: WACC is used to determine a company's overall cost of capital.\n    - **Equation**:\n      \\[\n      \\text{WACC} = \\frac{E}{V} \\times R_e + \\frac{D}{V} \\times R_d \\times (1 - T_c)\n      \\]\n      where \\( E \\) is the market value of equity, \\( D \\) is the market value of debt, \\( V \\) is the total market value of the company's financing, \\( R_e \\) is the cost of equity, \\( R_d \\) is the cost of debt, and \\( T_c \\) is the corporate tax rate.\n\n### Mermaid Knowledge Graph\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[Financial Forensics] --> B[Net Present Value];\n    A --> C[Debt Equity Ratio];\n    A --> D[Price-Earnings Ratio];\n    A --> E[Inventory Turnover Ratio];\n    A --> F[Return on Assets];\n    A --> G[Return on Equity];\n    A --> H[Capital Asset Pricing Model];\n    A --> I[Annuity and Perpetuity];\n    A --> J[Rollback and Roll Forward Rates];\n    A --> K[Weighted Average Cost of Capital];\n```\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    B[Net Present Value] --> B1[Cash Flows];\n    B --> B2[Discount Rate];\n    C[Debt Equity Ratio] --> C1[Total Debt];\n    C --> C2[Total Equity];\n    D[Price-Earnings Ratio] --> D1[Market Price per Share];\n    D --> D2[Earnings per Share];\n    E[Inventory Turnover Ratio] --> E1[Cost of Goods Sold];\n    E --> E2[Average Inventory];\n    F[Return on Assets] --> F1[Net Income];\n    F --> F2[Average Total Assets];\n    G[Return on Equity] --> G1[Net Income];\n    G --> G2[Shareholders' Equity];\n    H[Capital Asset Pricing Model] --> H1[Expected Return];\n    H --> H2[Risk-Free Rate];\n    H --> H3[Beta];\n    H --> H4[Market Return];\n    I[Annuity and Perpetuity] --> I1[Present Value];\n    I --> I2[Payment Amount];\n    I --> I3[Discount Rate];\n    J[Rollback and Roll Forward Rates] --> J1[Delinquency Status];\n    J --> J2[Transition Rates];\n    K[Weighted Average Cost of Capital] --> K1[Cost of Equity];\n    K --> K2[Cost of Debt];\n    K --> K3[Corporate Tax Rate];\n```\n\nThis summary and the knowledge graphs provide a clear and structured overview of the core topics, concepts, principles, and equations essential for the exam on Financial Forensics.",
