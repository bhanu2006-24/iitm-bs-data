The aim of the AI engine is to shortlist applicants who have the highest chance of completing the program. Hence, the AI engine classifies every applicant as either \u201cSelected\u201d or \u201cNot Selected\u201d based on the \u201cProbability of Completion\u201d which is computed using an applicant\u2019s previous academic and professional records (X mark, XII mark, work experience, conduct and number of extracurricular certificates)  To test the model, past student data was captured. Using the past data, the AI model predicted the probability for completion. This is provided in Table-2. The table also provides the information of whether the student actually completed the course.Given this information, answer the subquestions.  ",
