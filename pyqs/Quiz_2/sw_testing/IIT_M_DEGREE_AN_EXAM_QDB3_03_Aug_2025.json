**Finite State Machines (FSM)**: State coverage.\n   - **Predicate Logic**: Understanding predicates and their conditions.\n   - **Requirement Types**: Business requirements, usability requirements, non-functional requirements, regulatory requirements.\n\n2. **Partition Testing**\n   - **Equivalence Class Partitioning**: Identifying partitions and their properties.\n   - **Boundary Value Analysis (BVA)**: Selecting test inputs that satisfy BVA.\n\n3. **Integration Testing**\n   - **Top-Down Approach**: Use of test stubs and test drivers.\n\n4. **Base Choice Coverage (BCC)**\n   - **Partition Testing**: Understanding base choice and additional tests required.\n\n5. **Control Flow Graph (CFG)**\n   - **Linearly Independent Paths**: Identifying the number of linearly independent paths.\n   - **Edge-Pair Coverage**: Calculating test requirements for edge-pair coverage.\n   - **Edge Coverage**: Minimum number of test paths to achieve edge coverage.\n\n6. **Concolic Testing (DART)**\n   - **Symbolic Execution**: Understanding path constraints and symbolic values.\n   - **Concrete Test Inputs**: Identifying sets of concrete test inputs for symbolic execution.\n\n7. **Logical Predicates and Truth Tables**\n   - **CNF and DNF**: Conjunctive Normal Form and Disjunctive Normal Form.\n   - **RACC, GICC, and RICC Pairs**: Understanding these pairs in the context of truth tables.\n\n#### Important Equations and Principles\n\n1. **Predicate Logic**\n   - **Predicate \\( p \\)**: \\( p = \\neg a \\lor (b \\land c) \\)\n   - **Conditions for Clause \\( a \\)**: \\( p_a = \\neg a \\land (b \\land c) \\)\n\n2. **Boundary Value Analysis (BVA)**\n   - **Test Inputs**: For a partition \\( 0 \\leq score \\leq 120 \\), test inputs should include boundary values and values outside the partition.\n\n3. **Base Choice Coverage (BCC)**\n   - **Additional Tests**: For partitions with blocks \\([A, B, C, D]\\), \\([1, 2, 3]\\), \\([p, q]\\), and \\([x, y]\\), with base choice \\((C, 2, q, y)\\), additional tests are required to cover all combinations.\n\n4. **Control Flow Graph (CFG)**\n   - **Linearly Independent Paths**: For a given CFG, calculate the number of linearly independent paths.\n   - **Edge-Pair Coverage**: Calculate the number of test requirements for edge-pair coverage.\n   - **Edge Coverage**: Determine the minimum number of test paths to achieve edge coverage.\n\n5. **Concolic Testing (DART)**\n   - **Path Constraints**: For a given code segment, identify the path constraints that lead to specific execution paths.\n   - **Concrete Test Inputs**: Identify sets of concrete test inputs that execute all instances of symbolic execution.\n\n6. **Logical Predicates and Truth Tables**\n   - **CNF and DNF**: Understand the structure of predicates in CNF and DNF.\n   - **RACC, GICC, and RICC Pairs**: Identify these pairs in the context of truth tables for a given predicate.\n\n### Mermaid Knowledge Graph\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[Software Testing Fundamentals] --> B[Graph Coverage Criteria];\n    A --> C[Finite State Machines];\n    A --> D[Predicate Logic];\n    A --> E[Requirement Types];\n    B --> F[Node Coverage];\n    B --> G[Edge Coverage];\n    B --> H[Edge-Pair Coverage];\n    B --> I[Prime Path Coverage];\n    C --> J[State Coverage];\n    D --> K[Predicate Conditions];\n    E --> L[Business Requirements];\n    E --> M[Usability Requirements];\n    E --> N[Non-Functional Requirements];\n    E --> O[Regulatory Requirements];\n```\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    P[Partition Testing] --> Q[Equivalence Class Partitioning];\n    P --> R[Boundary Value Analysis];\n    Q --> S[Identifying Partitions];\n    Q --> T[Properties of Partitions];\n    R --> U[Selecting Test Inputs];\n    R --> V[Boundary Values];\n```\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    W[Integration Testing] --> X[Top-Down Approach];\n    X --> Y[Test Stubs];\n    X --> Z[Test Drivers];\n```\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    AA[Base Choice Coverage] --> AB[Partition Testing];\n    AB --> AC[Base Choice];\n    AB --> AD[Additional Tests];\n```\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    AE[Control Flow Graph] --> AF[Linearly Independent Paths];\n    AE --> AG[Edge-Pair Coverage];\n    AE --> AH[Edge Coverage];\n    AF --> AI[Number of Paths];\n    AG --> AJ[Test Requirements];\n    AH --> AK[Minimum Test Paths];\n```\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    AL[Concolic Testing] --> AM[Symbolic Execution];\n    AL --> AN[Concrete Test Inputs];\n    AM --> AO[Path Constraints];\n    AN --> AP[Test Input Sets];\n```\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    AQ[Logical Predicates] --> AR[CNF and DNF];\n    AQ --> AS[Truth Tables];\n    AR --> AT[Predicate Structure];\n    AS --> AU[RACC Pairs];\n    AS --> AV[GICC Pairs];\n    AS --> AW[RICC Pairs];\n```\n\nThis summary and the knowledge graphs should help you understand the core topics, concepts, principles, and equations essential for the exam.",
