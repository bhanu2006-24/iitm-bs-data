        "summary": "### Summary of Core Topics, Concepts, Principles, and Equations\n\n#### 1. **Software Testing Basics**\n- **Types of Testing**: Usability, Business, Non-functional, Regulatory requirements.\n- **Integration Testing**: Top-down approach, use of test stubs.\n\n#### 2. **Graph Coverage Criteria**\n- **Node Coverage**: Equivalent to state coverage on a finite state machine (FSM).\n- **Edge Coverage**: Covers all edges in a control flow graph.\n- **Edge-Pair Coverage**: Covers all pairs of edges.\n- **Prime Path Coverage**: Covers all prime paths in a graph.\n\n#### 3. **Boundary Value Analysis (BVA)**\n- **Definition**: Testing at the boundaries of input partitions.\n- **Example**: For a score range \\(0 \\leq score \\leq 120\\), test inputs should include values at and around the boundaries, such as \\(-3, 0, 30, 40, 120, 125\\).\n\n#### 4. **Base Choice Coverage (BCC)**\n- **Definition**: Ensuring that all base choices in a partition are covered.\n- **Example**: For partitions with blocks \\([A, B, C, D]\\), \\([1, 2, 3]\\), \\([p, q]\\), and \\([x, y]\\), with base choice \\([C, 2, q, y]\\), additional tests are required to cover all other choices.\n\n#### 5. **Equivalence Class Partitioning**\n- **Definition**: Dividing input data into partitions and testing one condition from each partition.\n- **Example**: For a CGPA range divided into different waiver percentages, each range is an equivalence class.\n\n#### 6. **Symbolic Testing and Path Constraints**\n- **Definition**: Using symbolic values to represent inputs and generating path constraints.\n- **Example**: For a loop with \\(n\\) true outcomes followed by a false, the path constraint is \\(\\left( \\bigwedge_{i \\in [0, n-1]} r_i \\geq 0 \\right) \\land \\left( r_n < 0 \\right)\\).\n\n#### 7. **Predicate Logic**\n- **Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF)**: A conjunction of disjunctions.\n- **Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF)**: A disjunction of conjunctions.\n- **Example**: The predicate \\( p = (a \\land b) \\lor (\\neg a \\land b) \\lor (p \\land \\neg q) \\) is in DNF and has three conjunctions.\n\n#### 8. **Control Flow Graph (CFG)**\n- **Definition**: A graphical representation of the control flow of a program.\n- **Linearly Independent Paths**: Paths that introduce at least one new set of processing statements.\n- **Example**: For a CFG with vertices \\(V = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\\}\\) and edges \\(E = \\{(1,2), (2,3), (2,7), (3,4), (4,5), (5,3), (5,6), (6,7)\\}\\), there are 3 linearly independent paths.\n\n#### 9. **Concolic Testing**\n- **Definition**: A combination of concrete and symbolic execution.\n- **Path Constraints**: Generated during symbolic execution to represent conditions under which a path is taken.\n- **Example**: For a path leading to an `abort()` call, the path constraint might be \\(((a_0 > c_0), (b_0 \\cdot b_0 - 4 \\cdot a_0 \\cdot c_0 \\leq 0))\\).\n\n#### 10. **Truth Tables and Logical Predicates**\n- **RACC Pair**: Relative Active Clause Coverage pair.\n- **GICC Pair**: General Inactive Clause Coverage pair.\n- **RICC Pair**: Relative Inactive Clause Coverage pair.\n- **Example**: For the predicate \\( p = (a \\land c) \\lor \\neg b \\), RACC pairs, GICC pairs, and RICC pairs can be identified from the truth table.\n\n### Knowledge Graph \n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[Software Testing Basics] --> B[Types of Testing];\n    A --> C[Integration Testing];\n    B --> D[Usability Requirement];\n    B --> E[Business Requirement];\n    B --> F[Non-functional Requirement];\n    B --> G[Regulatory Requirement];\n    C --> H[Top-down Approach];\n    C --> I[Test Stubs];\n    A --> J[Graph Coverage Criteria];\n    J --> K[Node Coverage];\n    J --> L[Edge Coverage];\n    J --> M[Edge-Pair Coverage];\n    J --> N[Prime Path Coverage];\n    A --> O[Boundary Value Analysis];\n    O --> P[Test Inputs at Boundaries];\n    A --> Q[Base Choice Coverage];\n    Q --> R[Additional Tests for Coverage];\n    A --> S[Equivalence Class Partitioning];\n    S --> T[Dividing Input Data];\n    A --> U[Symbolic Testing];\n    U --> V[Path Constraints];\n    A --> W[Predicate Logic];\n    W --> X[Conjunctive Normal Form];\n    W --> Y[Disjunctive Normal Form];\n    A --> Z[Control Flow Graph];\n    Z --> AA[Linearly Independent Paths];\n    A --> AB[Concolic Testing];\n    AB --> AC[Path Constraints];\n    A --> AD[Truth Tables and Logical Predicates];\n    AD --> AE[RACC Pair];\n    AD --> AF[GICC Pair];\n    AD --> AG[RICC Pair];\n```\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    B[Graph Coverage Criteria] --> C[Node Coverage];\n    B --> D[Edge Coverage];\n    B --> E[Edge-Pair Coverage];\n    B --> F[Prime Path Coverage];\n    G[Boundary Value Analysis] --> H[Test Inputs at Boundaries];\n    I[Base Choice Coverage] --> J[Additional Tests for Coverage];\n    K[Equivalence Class Partitioning] --> L[Dividing Input Data];\n    M[Symbolic Testing] --> N[Path Constraints];\n    O[Predicate Logic] --> P[Conjunctive Normal Form];\n    O --> Q[Disjunctive Normal Form];\n    R[Control Flow Graph] --> S[Linearly Independent Paths];\n    T[Concolic Testing] --> U[Path Constraints];\n    V[Truth Tables and Logical Predicates] --> W[RACC Pair];\n    V --> X[GICC Pair];\n    V --> Y[RICC Pair];\n```\n\nThese graphs visually map the relationships between the core topics in software testing, making it easier to understand the connections and dependencies between different concepts.",
