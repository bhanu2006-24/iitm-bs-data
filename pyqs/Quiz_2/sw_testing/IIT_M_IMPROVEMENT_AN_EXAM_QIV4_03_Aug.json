**Finite State Machines (FSM)**: State coverage.\n   - **Predicate Logic**: Understanding predicates and their conditions.\n   - **Requirement Types**: Usability, business, non-functional, regulatory requirements.\n\n2. **Equivalence Partitioning and Boundary Value Analysis (BVA)**\n   - **Equivalence Class Partitions**: Identifying partitions based on input ranges.\n   - **Boundary Value Analysis**: Testing boundary values of input ranges.\n\n3. **Integration Testing**\n   - **Top-Down Approach**: Use of test stubs.\n   - **Bottom-Up Approach**: Use of test drivers.\n\n4. **Base Choice Coverage (BCC)**\n   - **Partition Testing**: Understanding base choice and additional test requirements.\n\n5. **Control Flow Graph (CFG)**\n   - **Linearly Independent Paths**: Identifying independent paths in a CFG.\n   - **Edge-Pair Coverage**: Test requirements for edge-pair coverage.\n   - **Edge Coverage**: Minimum number of test paths to achieve edge coverage.\n\n6. **Symbolic Testing and Concolic Testing**\n   - **Path Constraints**: Generating path constraints for symbolic execution.\n   - **Concolic Testing (DART)**: Combining concrete and symbolic execution.\n\n7. **Logical Predicates and Truth Tables**\n   -

**Conditions for Clause Determination**: \\( p_a = a \\land (b \\land c) \\)\n\n2. **Boundary Value Analysis**\n   - **Boundary Values**: For a range \\( 0 \\leq score \\leq 120 \\), test inputs include \\(-3, 0, 30, 40, 120, 125\\).\n\n3. **Path Constraints in Symbolic Testing**\n   - **Path Constraint for While Loop**:\n     \\[\n     \\bigwedge_{i \\in [0, n-1]} (r_i \\geq 0) \\land (r_n < 0)\n     \\]\n   - **Path Constraint for Abort Call**:\n     \\[\n     ((a_0 > c_0), (b_0 \\cdot b_0 - 4 \\cdot a_0 \\cdot c_0 \\leq 0))\n     \\]\n\n4. **Control Flow Graph (CFG)**\n   - **Linearly Independent Paths**: Calculated based on the number of independent paths.\n   - **Edge-Pair Coverage**: Test requirements based on pairs of edges.\n   -
