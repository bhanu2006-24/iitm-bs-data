\\( p = \\neg a \\lor (b \\land c) \\)\n   - \\( p = (a \\land b) \\lor (\\neg a \\land b) \\lor (p \\land \\neg q) \\)\n\n2. **Boundary Value Analysis (BVA)**:\n   - For a partition \\( 0 \\leq score \\leq 120 \\), test inputs include boundary values and values just outside the boundaries.\n\n3. **Path Constraints**:\n   - For a while loop with a sequence of \\( n \\) true outcomes followed by a false:\n     \\[\n     \\bigwedge_{i \\in [0, n-1]} (r_i \\geq 0) \\land (r_n < 0)\n     \\]\n\n4. **Control Flow Graph (CFG)**:\n   - Vertices \\( V = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\\} \\)\n   - Edges \\( E = \\{(1,2), (2,3), (2,7), (3,4), (4,5), (5,3), (5,6), (6,7)\\} \\)\n\n### Knowledge Graph \n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[Software Testing] --> B[Graph Coverage Criteria];\n    A --> C[Predicate Logic];\n    A --> D[Requirement Types];\n    A --> E[Partition Testing];\n    A --> F[Integration Testing];\n    A --> G[Control Flow Graph];\n    A --> H[Symbolic Testing];\n    A --> I[Equivalence Class Partitions];\n\n    B --> B1[Node Coverage];\n    B --> B2[Edge Coverage];\n    B --> B3[Prime Path Coverage];\n    B --> B4[Edge-Pair Coverage];\n\n    C --> C1[Predicate];\n    C --> C2[Clause Determination];\n    C --> C3[CNF];\n    C --> C4[DNF];\n\n    D --> D1[Business Requirements];\n    D --> D2[Usability Requirements];\n    D --> D3[Non-Functional Requirements];\n    D --> D4[Regulatory Requirements];\n\n    E --> E1[Equivalence Partitioning];\n    E --> E2[Boundary Value Analysis];\n    E --> E3[Base Choice Coverage];\n\n    F --> F1[Top-Down Approach];\n    F --> F2[Test Stubs];\n\n    G --> G1[Vertices and Edges];\n    G --> G2[Linearly Independent Paths];\n    G --> G3[Edge-Pair Coverage];\n\n    H --> H1[Symbolic Execution];\n    H --> H2[Path Constraints];\n    H --> H3[Concolic Testing];\n\n    I --> I1[Identifying Partitions];\n    I --> I2[Testing Partitions];\n```\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[Software Testing] --> B[Graph Coverage Criteria];\n    A --> C[Predicate Logic];\n    A --> D[Requirement Types];\n    A --> E[Partition Testing];\n    A --> F[Integration Testing];\n    A --> G[Control Flow Graph];\n    A --> H[Symbolic Testing];\n    A --> I[Equivalence Class Partitions];\n\n    B --> B1[Node Coverage];\n    B --> B2[Edge Coverage];\n    B --> B3[Prime Path Coverage];\n    B --> B4[Edge-Pair Coverage];\n\n    C --> C1[Predicate];\n    C --> C2[Clause Determination];\n    C --> C3[CNF];\n    C --> C4[DNF];\n\n    D --> D1[Business Requirements];\n    D --> D2[Usability Requirements];\n    D --> D3[Non-Functional Requirements];\n    D --> D4[Regulatory Requirements];\n\n    E --> E1[Equivalence Partitioning];\n    E --> E2[Boundary Value Analysis];\n    E --> E3[Base Choice Coverage];\n\n    F --> F1[Top-Down Approach];\n    F --> F2[Test Stubs];\n\n    G --> G1[Vertices and Edges];\n    G --> G2[Linearly Independent Paths];\n    G --> G3[Edge-Pair Coverage];\n\n    H --> H1[Symbolic Execution];\n    H --> H2[Path Constraints];\n    H --> H3[Concolic Testing];\n\n    I --> I1[Identifying Partitions];\n    I --> I2[Testing Partitions];\n```\n\nThis summary and knowledge graph should help you focus on the essential topics and concepts for your exam.",
