Initialization of cluster centroids.\n    2. Measurement of distances of each point to centroids.\n    3. Assignment of data points to respective clusters.\n    4. Updation of cluster centroids, and repeat.\n- **Soft K-means**: A variant of K-means where data points can belong to multiple clusters with certain probabilities.\n- **Stiffness Parameter (\u03b2)**: Controls the fuzziness of the clustering in soft K-means.\n\n#### 5. **Mathematical Equations**\n- **Hamming Distance**:\n  \\[\n  d_H(x, y) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\mathbb{I}_{x_i \\neq y_i}\n  \\]\n  where \\( \\mathbb{I} \\) is the indicator function.\n\n- **Responsibility in Soft K-means**:\n  \\[\n  r_{ik} = \\frac{\\exp(-\\beta d(x_i, c_k))}{\\sum_{j=1}^{K} \\exp(-\\beta d(x_i, c_j))}\n  \\]\n  where \\( d(x_i, c_k) \\) is the distance between data point \\( x_i \\) and centroid \\( c_k \\), and \\( \\beta \\) is the stiffness parameter.\n\n### Knowledge Graph \n\n#### Graph 1: Phylogenetic Trees and Algorithms\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[Phylogenetic Trees] --> B[Neighbor-Joining Algorithm];\n    A --> C[UPGMA];\n    A --> D[Parsimony Principle];\n    B --> E[Hamming Distance];\n    C --> E;\n```\n\n#### Graph 2: Distance Matrices and Additivity\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    F[Distance Matrices] --> G[Additive Distance Matrix];\n    F --> H[Ultrametric Tree];\n    G --> I[Phylogenetic Tree];\n    H --> I;\n```\n\n#### Graph 3: Suffix Trees and Tries\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    J[Suffix Structures] --> K[Suffix Trie];\n    J --> L[Suffix Tree];\n    J --> M[Burrows-Wheeler Transform];\n    K --> L;\n```\n\n#### Graph 4: K-means Clustering\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    N[K-means Clustering] --> O[Initialization of Centroids];\n    N --> P[Distance Measurement];\n    N --> Q[Assignment of Data Points];\n    N --> R[Updation of Centroids];\n    O --> P;\n    P --> Q;\n    Q --> R;\n    R --> P;\n    N --> S[Soft K-means];\n    S --> T[Stiffness Parameter \u03b2];\n```\n\nThese graphs and summaries should help you understand the core topics and their relationships, essential for preparing for the exam.",
