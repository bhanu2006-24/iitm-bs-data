Players have beliefs about the types of other players.\n  - Strategies are chosen to maximize expected payoffs given these beliefs.\n  - Equilibrium involves both strategies and beliefs.\n\n#### 2. **Normal Form Representation**\n- **Concept**: A way to describe a game using a matrix that shows the players, strategies, and payoffs.\n- **Key Points**:\n  - Rows represent strategies of one player.\n  - Columns represent strategies of the other player.\n  - Cells show the payoffs for each combination of strategies.\n\n#### 3. **Payoff Functions**\n- **Concept**: Mathematical functions that describe the payoffs players receive based on their strategies.\n- **Key Equations**:\n  - \\( v_i(a_1, a_2) = a_i - 2a_j + a_i a_j - (a_i)^2 \\)\n\n#### 4. **Nash Equilibrium**\n- **Concept**: A set of strategies where no player can benefit by unilaterally changing their strategy.\n- **Key Points**:\n  - Players are in equilibrium if they are playing their best response to each other's strategies.\n  - Can be found using the normal form representation and payoff functions.\n\n#### 5. **Repeated Games and Cooperation**\n- **Concept**: Games that are played repeatedly, allowing for the possibility of cooperation and long-term strategies.\n- **Key Points**:\n  - Players can use strategies that depend on the history of play.\n  - Cooperation can be sustained as a subgame perfect equilibrium if the discount factor is high enough.\n\n#### 6. **Discount Factors**\n- **Concept**: A factor that represents the weight players place on future payoffs relative to current payoffs.\n- **Key Points**:\n  - Higher discount factors make future payoffs more important.\n  - Critical for sustaining cooperation in repeated games.\n\n#### 7. **Evolutionarily Stable Strategy (ESS)**\n- **Concept**: A strategy that, if adopted by a population, cannot be invaded by any alternative strategy.\n- **Key Points**:\n  - A strategy is ESS if it is the best response to itself.\n  - Can be found by analyzing the payoff matrix and identifying strategies that are resistant to invasion.\n\n#### 8. **Probability and Bayesian Updating**\n- **Concept**: Updating beliefs based on new information using Bayes' theorem.\n- **Key Equations**:\n  - \\( P(A|B) = \\frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} \\)\n  - Probability calculations for different urn scenarios.\n\n#### 9. **Stable Matching (Gale-Shapley Algorithm)**\n- **Concept**: An algorithm to find a stable matching between two sets of elements (e.g., men and women).\n- **Key Points**:\n  - One set of elements proposes to the other set.\n  - Matches are made based on preferences and rejections.\n  - The algorithm guarantees a stable matching where no two elements prefer each other over their assigned matches.\n\n### Knowledge Graph \n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    GameTheory --> BayesianNashEquilibrium;\n    GameTheory --> NormalFormRepresentation;\n    GameTheory --> PayoffFunctions;\n    GameTheory --> NashEquilibrium;\n    GameTheory --> RepeatedGames;\n    GameTheory --> DiscountFactors;\n    GameTheory --> ESS;\n    GameTheory --> Probability;\n    GameTheory --> StableMatching;\n    BayesianNashEquilibrium --> IncompleteInformation;\n    BayesianNashEquilibrium --> ExpectedPayoffs;\n    NormalFormRepresentation --> Strategies;\n    NormalFormRepresentation --> Payoffs;\n    PayoffFunctions --> MathematicalFunctions;\n    NashEquilibrium --> BestResponse;\n    RepeatedGames --> Cooperation;\n    DiscountFactors --> FuturePayoffs;\n    ESS --> InvasionResistance;\n    Probability --> BayesianUpdating;\n    StableMatching --> GaleShapleyAlgorithm;\n```\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    BayesianGame --> Player1;\n    BayesianGame --> Player2;\n    Player1 --> StrategyU;\n    Player1 --> StrategyD;\n    Player2 --> StrategyL;\n    Player2 --> StrategyR;\n    StrategyU --> Payoff1;\n    StrategyD --> Payoff2;\n    StrategyL --> Payoff3;\n    StrategyR --> Payoff4;\n    Payoff1 --> Theta0;\n    Payoff2 --> Theta0;\n    Payoff3 --> Theta0;\n    Payoff4 --> Theta0;\n    Payoff1 --> Theta1;\n    Payoff2 --> Theta1;\n    Payoff3 --> Theta1;\n    Payoff4 --> Theta1;\n```\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    PoliticalParties --> NegativeCampaign;\n    NegativeCampaign --> PayoffFunction;\n    PayoffFunction --> vi;\n    vi --> ai;\n    vi --> aj;\n    vi --> aiaj;\n    vi --> ai2;\n    NegativeCampaign --> NashEquilibrium;\n    NashEquilibrium --> SymmetricEquilibrium;\n    SymmetricEquilibrium --> CampaignTime;\n    CampaignTime --> EquilibriumPayoff;\n    NegativeCampaign --> Cooperation;\n    Cooperation --> BindingAgreement;\n    BindingAgreement --> CampaignLevels;\n    Cooperation --> RepeatedGame;\n    RepeatedGame --> DiscountFactor;\n    DiscountFactor --> SubgamePerfectEquilibrium;\n```\n\nThese graphs provide a visual representation of the relationships between the core topics in the exam.
