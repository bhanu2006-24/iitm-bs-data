Neural Networks and Training\n- **Gradient Descent**: Optimization algorithm used to minimize the loss function.\n- **Loss Curves**: Training loss (solid curve) and validation loss (dashed curve).\n- **Learning Rate**: Hyperparameter that controls the step size in gradient descent.\n- **Bias-Variance Tradeoff**: Understanding the balance between underfitting and overfitting.\n  - **High Bias**: Underfitting, high error on both training and validation sets.\n  - **High Variance**: Overfitting, low error on training set but high error on validation set.\n\n#### 2. Optimizers\n- **Adaptive Learning Rate Optimizers**:\n  - **ADAM**: Combines the benefits of AdaGrad and RMSProp.\n  - **RMSprop**: Uses a moving average of squared gradients to normalize the gradient.\n  - **Momentum-based GD**: Uses momentum to accelerate gradients in the right direction.\n  - **Nesterov Accelerated Gradient Descent**: An extension of momentum-based GD.\n\n#### 3. Autoencoders\n- **Structure**: Feedforward neural network where the input and output layers have the same number of neurons.\n- **Weight Matrices**: \\( W_1 \\) and \\( W_2 \\), where \\( W_2 \\) can be tied to \\( W_1^T \\).\n- **Parameter Storage**: Number of parameters in tied vs. untied weight matrices.\n\n#### 4. Cross-Entropy Loss\n- **Formula**:\n  \\[ L = -\\sum_{i=1}^{n} y_{\\text{noise}, i} \\log(\\hat{y}_i) \\]\n- **Application**: Used in multi-class classification problems to measure the performance of a classification model.\n\n#### 5.
