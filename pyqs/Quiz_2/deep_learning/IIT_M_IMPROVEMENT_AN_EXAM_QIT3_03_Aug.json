        "summary": "### Summary of Core Topics, Concepts, Principles, and Equations\n\n#### 1. Neural Networks and Training\n- **Gradient Descent**: Optimization algorithm used to minimize the loss function.\n- **Loss Curves**: Training loss vs. validation loss to diagnose model performance.\n- **Learning Rate**: Hyperparameter that controls the step size in gradient descent.\n- **Bias-Variance Tradeoff**: Understanding overfitting and underfitting.\n  - **High Bias**: Underfitting, high error on both training and validation sets.\n  - **High Variance**: Overfitting, low error on training set but high error on validation set.\n\n#### 2. Optimizers\n- **Adaptive Learning Rate Optimizers**:\n  - **ADAM**: Combines the benefits of AdaGrad and RMSProp.\n  - **RMSprop**: Uses a moving average of squared gradients to normalize the gradient.\n  - **Momentum-based GD**: Uses momentum to accelerate gradients in the right directions.\n  - **Nesterov Accelerated Gradient Descent**: An extension of momentum-based GD.\n\n#### 3. Autoencoders\n- **Structure**: Input and output layers have the same number of neurons, with a hidden layer having fewer neurons.\n- **Weight Matrices**: \\( W_1 \\) and \\( W_2 \\), where \\( W_2 \\) can be tied to \\( W_1^T \\).\n\n#### 4. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)\n- **Convolutional Layer**: Applies convolution operations using kernels.\n- **Output Shape Calculation**:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Output Shape} = \\left( \\frac{W - K + 2P}{S} + 1, \\frac{H - K + 2P}{S} + 1, \\text{Number of Kernels} \\right)\n  \\]\n  where \\( W \\) and \\( H \\) are the width and height of the input, \\( K \\) is the kernel size, \\( P \\) is the padding, and \\( S \\) is the stride.\n- **Number of Parameters**:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Number of Parameters} = (\\text{Kernel Size}^2 \\times \\text{Input Depth} + 1) \\times \\text{Number of Kernels}\n  \\]\n\n#### 5. Regularization\n- **L2 Regularization**: Adds a penalty term to the loss function to prevent overfitting.\n  \\[\n  L_R(w) = \\frac{\\lambda}{2} \\cdot \\|w\\|^2\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  L = L_D + L_R\n  \\]\n  where \\( L_D \\) is the unregularized loss and \\( \\lambda \\) is the regularization rate.\n\n#### 6. Cross-Entropy Loss\n- **Formula**:\n  \\[\n  L(y, \\hat{y}) = -\\sum_{i} y_i \\log(\\hat{y}_i)\n  \\]\n  where \\( y \\) is the true label and \\( \\hat{y} \\) is the predicted probability distribution.\n\n#### 7. ReLU and Linear Activation\n- **ReLU**: \\( \\text{ReLU}(z) = \\max(0, z) \\)\n- **Linear Activation**: Used in the output layer for regression problems.\n\n### Knowledge Graph \n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[Neural Networks] --> B[Gradient Descent];\n    A --> C[Loss Curves];\n    A --> D[Learning Rate];\n    A --> E[Bias-Variance Tradeoff];\n    B --> F[Optimizers];\n    F --> G[ADAM];\n    F --> H[RMSprop];\n    F --> I[Momentum-based GD];\n    F --> J[Nesterov Accelerated Gradient Descent];\n    A --> K[Autoencoders];\n    K --> L[Weight Matrices];\n    A --> M[Convolutional Neural Networks];\n    M --> N[Convolutional Layer];\n    M --> O[Output Shape Calculation];\n    M --> P[Number of Parameters];\n    A --> Q[Regularization];\n    Q --> R[L2 Regularization];\n    A --> S[Cross-Entropy Loss];\n    A --> T[ReLU and Linear Activation];\n```\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    B[Gradient Descent] --> C[Loss Curves];\n    C --> D[Learning Rate];\n    D --> E[Bias-Variance Tradeoff];\n    E --> F[Optimizers];\n    F --> G[ADAM];\n    F --> H[RMSprop];\n    F --> I[Momentum-based GD];\n    F --> J[Nesterov Accelerated Gradient Descent];\n    K[Autoencoders] --> L[Weight Matrices];\n    M[Convolutional Neural Networks] --> N[Convolutional Layer];\n    N --> O[Output Shape Calculation];\n    N --> P[Number of Parameters];\n    Q[Regularization] --> R[L2 Regularization];\n    S[Cross-Entropy Loss] --> T[ReLU and Linear Activation];\n```\n\nThese graphs illustrate the relationships between the core topics and concepts in deep learning, focusing on the essential areas to study for the exam.",
