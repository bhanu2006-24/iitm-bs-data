        "summary": "### Summary of Core Topics, Concepts, Principles, and Equations\n\n#### 1. Neural Networks and Training\n- **Gradient Descent**: Optimization algorithm used to minimize the loss function.\n- **Loss Curves**: Training loss (solid line) and validation loss (dashed line) to monitor model performance.\n- **Learning Rate**: Hyperparameter that controls the step size in gradient descent.\n- **Bias-Variance Tradeoff**: Understanding overfitting and underfitting in models.\n\n#### 2. Optimizers\n- **Adaptive Learning Rate Optimizers**: ADAM and RMSprop use adaptive learning rates.\n  - **ADAM**: Combines the benefits of AdaGrad and RMSProp.\n  - **RMSprop**: Uses a moving average of squared gradients to normalize the gradient.\n\n#### 3. Autoencoders\n- **Architecture**: Input and output layers have the same number of neurons; hidden layer has fewer neurons.\n- **Weight Matrices**: \\( W_1 \\) and \\( W_2 \\) can be tied or untied.\n- **Parameter Storage**: Number of parameters in tied vs. untied networks.\n\n#### 4. Cross-Entropy Loss\n- **Formula**: \\( L = -\\sum_{i=1}^{n} y_{\\text{noise},i} \\log(\\hat{y}_i) \\)\n- **Application**: Used in multi-class classification problems.\n\n#### 5. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)\n- **Convolutional Layer**: Shape of the output volume, number of parameters.\n  - **Output Shape**: Calculated based on input shape, kernel size, stride, and padding.\n  - **Number of Parameters**: \\( (kernel\\_size^2 \\times input\\_depth + 1) \\times num\\_kernels \\)\n- **Max-Pooling Layer**: Reduces the spatial dimensions of the output volume.\n\n#### 6. Regularization\n- **L2-Regularization**: Adds a penalty term to the loss function to prevent overfitting.\n  - **Loss Function**: \\( L = L_D + L_R \\)\n  - **L2-Regularization Term**: \\( L_R(w) = \\frac{\\lambda}{2} \\|w\\|^2 \\)\n\n#### 7. ReLU Activation\n- **Definition**: \\( \\text{ReLU}(z) = \\max(0, z) \\)\n- **Application**: Used in hidden layers of neural networks.\n\n#### 8. Backpropagation\n- **Partial Derivatives**: Calculating gradients for weight updates.\n  - **Example**: \\( \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial w_1} \\) in a network with ReLU activations.\n\n### Equations\n\n#### Cross-Entropy Loss\n\\[ L = -\\sum_{i=1}^{n} y_{\\text{noise},i} \\log(\\hat{y}_i) \\]\n\n#### L2-Regularization\n\\[ L_R(w) = \\frac{\\lambda}{2} \\|w\\|^2 \\]\n\\[ L = L_D + L_R \\]\n\n#### Convolutional Layer Output Shape\n\\[ \\text{Output Shape} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Input Shape} - \\text{Kernel Size} + 2 \\times \\text{Padding}}{\\text{Stride}} + 1 \\right) \\times \\left( \\frac{\\text{Input Shape} - \\text{Kernel Size} + 2 \\times \\text{Padding}}{\\text{Stride}} + 1 \\right) \\times \\text{Number of Kernels} \\]\n\n#### Number of Parameters in Convolutional Layer\n\\[ \\text{Number of Parameters} = (kernel\\_size^2 \\times input\\_depth + 1) \\times num\\_kernels \\]\n\n### Knowledge Graph \n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[Neural Networks] --> B[Gradient Descent];\n    A --> C[Loss Curves];\n    A --> D[Learning Rate];\n    A --> E[Bias-Variance Tradeoff];\n    B --> F[Optimizers];\n    F --> G[ADAM];\n    F --> H[RMSprop];\n    F --> I[Momentum-based GD];\n    F --> J[Nesterov Accelerated Gradient Descent];\n    A --> K[Autoencoders];\n    K --> L[Weight Matrices];\n    K --> M[Parameter Storage];\n    A --> N[Cross-Entropy Loss];\n    A --> O[Convolutional Neural Networks];\n    O --> P[Convolutional Layer];\n    O --> Q[Max-Pooling Layer];\n    P --> R[Output Shape];\n    P --> S[Number of Parameters];\n    A --> T[Regularization];\n    T --> U[L2-Regularization];\n    A --> V[ReLU Activation];\n    A --> W[Backpropagation];\n    W --> X[Partial Derivatives];\n```\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    B[Gradient Descent] --> C[Loss Curves];\n    C --> D[Learning Rate];\n    D --> E[Bias-Variance Tradeoff];\n    F[Optimizers] --> G[ADAM];\n    F --> H[RMSprop];\n    F --> I[Momentum-based GD];\n    F --> J[Nesterov Accelerated Gradient Descent];\n    K[Autoencoders] --> L[Weight Matrices];\n    K --> M[Parameter Storage];\n    N[Cross-Entropy Loss] --> O[Convolutional Neural Networks];\n    O --> P[Convolutional Layer];\n    O --> Q[Max-Pooling Layer];\n    P --> R[Output Shape];\n    P --> S[Number of Parameters];\n    T[Regularization] --> U[L2-Regularization];\n    V[ReLU Activation] --> W[Backpropagation];\n    W --> X[Partial Derivatives];\n```\n\nThese graphs illustrate the relationships between the core topics and concepts in the field of deep learning.",
