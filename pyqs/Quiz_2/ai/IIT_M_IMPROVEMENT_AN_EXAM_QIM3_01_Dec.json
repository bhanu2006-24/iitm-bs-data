Search Algorithms\n- **A* Algorithm**: Uses a heuristic function to estimate the cost of the cheapest path from a node to the goal. The heuristic used here is the Manhattan distance.\n  - **f(n) = g(n) + h(n)**\n    - **g(n)**: Cost from the start node to node n.\n    - **h(n)**: Heuristic estimate of the cost from node n to the goal.\n- **Weighted A* (WA*) Algorithm**: A variant of A* where the heuristic is weighted to explore different paths.\n- **Branch-and-Bound**: An algorithm for finding the shortest path by systematically enumerating all candidate solutions and pruning those that do not meet certain criteria.\n\n#### 2. Heuristics\n- **Manhattan Distance**: A heuristic that calculates the distance between two points in a grid based on the sum of the absolute differences of their coordinates.\n  - **Manhattan Distance Formula**: \\( |x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2| \\)\n\n#### 3. Graph Representation\n- **Nodes and Edges**: Representation of locations and connections between them with associated costs.\n- **Adjacency List**: A collection of unordered lists used to represent a finite graph. Each list describes the set of neighbors of a vertex in the graph.\n\n#### 4. Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)\n- **Branch-and-Bound for TSP**: An algorithm to solve the TSP by systematically exploring branches of the search tree and bounding the cost of the solutions.\n- **Lower Bound Calculation**: The minimum possible cost of a tour.\n- **Permanent Segments**: Segments that are permanently included or excluded in the solution based on the branching decisions.\n\n#### 5. Game Trees\n- **Minimax Algorithm**: Used for decision-making in game theory, minimizing the possible loss for a worst-case scenario.\n- **Alpha-Beta Pruning**: An optimization technique for the minimax algorithm that reduces the number of nodes evaluated in the search tree.\n- **SSS* Algorithm**: A state-space search algorithm that uses heuristic evaluation functions to guide the search.\n\n#### 6. Automated Planning\n- **Predicates and Operators**: Definitions of the state and actions in a planning problem.\n- **Goal Stack Planning**: An algorithm that uses a stack to keep track of subgoals and actions to achieve them.\n- **Applicable and Relevant Actions**: Actions that can be executed in the current state and are relevant to achieving the goal.\n\n### Knowledge Graph \n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[Search Algorithms] --> B[A* Algorithm]\n    A --> C[Weighted A* Algorithm]\n    A --> D[Branch-and-Bound]\n    B --> E[Heuristics]\n    E --> F[Manhattan Distance]\n    A --> G[Graph Representation]\n    G --> H[Nodes and Edges]\n    G --> I[Adjacency List]\n    J[TSP] --> K[Branch-and-Bound for TSP]\n    K --> L[Lower Bound Calculation]\n    K --> M[Permanent Segments]\n    N[Game Trees] --> O[Minimax Algorithm]\n    N --> P[Alpha-Beta Pruning]\n    N --> Q[SSS* Algorithm]\n    R[Automated Planning] --> S[Predicates and Operators]\n    R --> T[Goal Stack Planning]\n    R --> U[Applicable and Relevant Actions]\n```\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    B[A* Algorithm] --> V[f(n) = g(n) + h(n)]\n    F[Manhattan Distance] --> W[|x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2|]\n    K[Branch-and-Bound for TSP] --> X[Lower Bound]\n    K --> Y[Permanent Segments]\n    O[Minimax Algorithm] --> Z[Decision-Making]\n    P[Alpha-Beta Pruning] --> AA[Optimization Technique]\n    Q[SSS* Algorithm] --> AB[Heuristic Evaluation]\n    T[Goal Stack Planning] --> AC[Subgoals and Actions]\n```\n\nThese graphs visually map the relationships between the core topics and concepts, providing a clear and easy-to-understand format.",
