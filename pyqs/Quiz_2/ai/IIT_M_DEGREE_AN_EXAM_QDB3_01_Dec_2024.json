Common heuristics include Manhattan distance.\n- **Tie-breaking Rules:** Rules to break ties when multiple nodes have the same cost. Often, alphabetical order is used.\n\n**Equations:**\n- **A* Algorithm:** \\( f(n) = g(n) + h(n) \\)\n  - \\( g(n) \\): Cost from the start node to node \\( n \\)\n  - \\( h(n) \\): Heuristic estimate of the cost from node \\( n \\) to the goal\n- **Weighted A* Algorithm:** \\( f(n) = g(n) + w \\cdot h(n) \\)\n  - \\( w \\): Weight factor\n\n#### 2.
