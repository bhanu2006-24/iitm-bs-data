Search Algorithms\n**Core Topics:**\n- A* Algorithm\n- Weighted A* (wA*) Algorithm\n- Branch-and-Bound Algorithm\n- Manhattan Distance Heuristic\n\n**Concepts and Principles:**\n- **A* Algorithm:** A* is a best-first search algorithm that uses a heuristic function to estimate the cost of the cheapest path from the current node to the goal. It combines the cost to reach the node (g(n)) and the heuristic estimate (h(n)) to form the f-value (f(n) = g(n) + h(n)).\n- **Weighted A* Algorithm:** Similar to A*, but includes a weight (w) to balance between the cost to reach the node and the heuristic estimate (f(n) = g(n) + w * h(n)).\n- **Branch-and-Bound Algorithm:** A systematic method for solving optimization problems by dividing the problem into subproblems and using bounds to eliminate suboptimal solutions.\n- **Manhattan Distance:** A heuristic that calculates the distance between two points in a grid based on the sum of the absolute differences of their coordinates.\n\n**Equations:**\n- **A* Algorithm:** \\( f(n) = g(n) + h(n) \\)\n- **Weighted A* Algorithm:** \\( f(n) = g(n) + w \\cdot h(n) \\)\n- **Manhattan Distance:** \\( h(n) = |x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2| \\)\n\n#### 2.
