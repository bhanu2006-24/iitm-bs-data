Search Algorithms\n- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Explores all nodes at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\n- **Best-First Search**: Uses an evaluation function to decide which node to expand next.\n- **Branch and Bound**: An algorithm for finding the shortest path in a graph, particularly useful in optimization problems.\n- **A* Algorithm**: Combines the benefits of BFS and Best-First Search using a cost function \\( f(n) = g(n) + h(n) \\), where \\( g(n) \\) is the cost to reach node \\( n \\) and \\( h(n) \\) is the heuristic estimate of the cost from \\( n \\) to the goal.\n- **Weighted A* Algorithm (\\( wA^* \\))**: A variant of A* where the heuristic is weighted by a factor \\( w \\).\n\n#### 2. Heuristics\n- **Admissible Heuristic**: A heuristic that never overestimates the cost to reach the goal.\n- **Heuristic Function**: \\( h(n) \\), which estimates the cost from node \\( n \\) to the goal.\n\n#### 3. Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)\n- **Distance Matrix**: A matrix representing the distances between cities.\n- **Branch and Bound for TSP**: Uses a lower bound to prune the search tree.\n- **Lower Bound Calculation**: Sum of the minimum distances for each city.\n\n#### 4. Game Theory\n- **Alpha-Beta Pruning**: A search algorithm that reduces the number of nodes evaluated in the search tree.\n- **Alpha-Cut and Beta-Cut**: Conditions that trigger pruning in the Alpha-Beta algorithm.\n- **Horizon Nodes**: Nodes at the deepest level of the search tree.\n- **SSS* Algorithm**: A state-space search algorithm used in game trees.\n\n#### 5. Automated Planning\n- **Predicates and Operators**: Definitions used in planning problems.\n- **Goal Stack Planning**: An algorithm for finding a plan to achieve a goal.\n- **Optimal Plan**: A plan with the minimum number of actions to achieve the goal.\n\n### Equations\n1. **Sum of Geometric Series**:\n   \\[\n   \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} ar^k = a \\frac{1 - r^n}{1 - r}\n   \\]\n\n2. **A* Algorithm Cost Function**:\n   \\[\n   f(n) = g(n) + h(n)\n   \\]\n   where \\( g(n) \\) is the cost to reach node \\( n \\) and \\( h(n) \\) is the heuristic estimate of the cost from \\( n \\) to the goal.\n\n3. **Weighted A* Algorithm Cost Function**:\n   \\[\n   f(n) = g(n) + w \\cdot h(n)\n   \\]\n   where \\( w \\) is the weight factor.\n\n### Knowledge Graph \n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[Search Algorithms] --> B[Breadth-First Search];\n    A --> C[Best-First Search];\n    A --> D[Branch and Bound];\n    A --> E[A* Algorithm];\n    A --> F[Weighted A* Algorithm];\n\n    G[Heuristics] --> H[Admissible Heuristic];\n    G --> I[Heuristic Function];\n\n    J[Traveling Salesman Problem] --> K[Distance Matrix];\n    J --> L[Branch and Bound for TSP];\n    J --> M[Lower Bound Calculation];\n\n    N[Game Theory] --> O[Alpha-Beta Pruning];\n    N --> P[Alpha-Cut and Beta-Cut];\n    N --> Q[Horizon Nodes];\n    N --> R[SSS* Algorithm];\n\n    S[Automated Planning] --> T[Predicates and Operators];\n    S --> U[Goal Stack Planning];\n    S --> V[Optimal Plan];\n```\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[Search Algorithms] --> B[Breadth-First Search];\n    A --> C[Best-First Search];\n    A --> D[Branch and Bound];\n    A --> E[A* Algorithm];\n    A --> F[Weighted A* Algorithm];\n\n    B -->|Finds Path| G[Yes];\n    C -->|Finds Path| G;\n    D -->|Finds Path| H[No];\n    E -->|Finds Path| H;\n    F -->|Finds Path| G;\n\n    I[Heuristics] --> J[Admissible Heuristic];\n    I --> K[Heuristic Function];\n\n    L[Traveling Salesman Problem] --> M[Distance Matrix];\n    L --> N[Branch and Bound for TSP];\n    L --> O[Lower Bound Calculation];\n\n    P[Game Theory] --> Q[Alpha-Beta Pruning];\n    P --> R[Alpha-Cut and Beta-Cut];\n    P --> S[Horizon Nodes];\n    P --> T[SSS* Algorithm];\n\n    U[Automated Planning] --> V[Predicates and Operators];\n    U --> W[Goal Stack Planning];\n    U --> X[Optimal Plan];\n```\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[Search Algorithms] --> B[Breadth-First Search];\n    A --> C[Best-First Search];\n    A --> D[Branch and Bound];\n    A --> E[A* Algorithm];\n    A --> F[Weighted A* Algorithm];\n\n    B -->|Finds Path| G[Yes];\n    C -->|Finds Path| G;\n    D -->|Finds Path| H[No];\n    E -->|Finds Path| H;\n    F -->|Finds Path| G;\n\n    I[Heuristics] --> J[Admissible Heuristic];\n    I --> K[Heuristic Function];\n\n    L[Traveling Salesman Problem] --> M[Distance Matrix];\n    L --> N[Branch and Bound for TSP];\n    L --> O[Lower Bound Calculation];\n\n    P[Game Theory] --> Q[Alpha-Beta Pruning];\n    P --> R[Alpha-Cut];\n    P --> S[Beta-Cut];\n    P --> T[Horizon Nodes];\n    P --> U[SSS* Algorithm];\n\n    V[Automated Planning] --> W[Predicates and Operators];\n    V --> X[Goal Stack Planning];\n    V --> Y[Optimal Plan];\n```\n\nThese graphs and summaries should help you understand the core topics and their relationships, making it easier to prepare for the exam.",
