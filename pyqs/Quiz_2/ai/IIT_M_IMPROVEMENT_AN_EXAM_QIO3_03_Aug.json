Search Algorithms\n- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Explores all nodes at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\n- **Best-First Search**: Uses an evaluation function to decide which node to expand next.\n- **Branch and Bound**: An algorithm for finding optimal solutions by systematically exploring candidate solutions and discarding those that cannot lead to a better solution than the best one found so far.\n- **A* Algorithm**: Combines the benefits of BFS and Best-First Search using a heuristic function to guide the search.\n- **Weighted A* (wA*)**: A variant of A* where the heuristic function is weighted to control the trade-off between path quality and search time.\n\n#### 2. Heuristics\n- **Admissible Heuristic**: A heuristic that never overestimates the cost to reach the goal.\n- **Heuristic Function**: A function that estimates the cost of the cheapest path from a given node to the goal.\n\n#### 3. Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)\n- **Branch and Bound for TSP**: A method to solve TSP by systematically exploring possible tours and discarding those that cannot lead to an optimal solution.\n- **Lower Bound**: The minimum possible cost of a tour.\n- **Upper Bound**: The cost of the best tour found so far.\n\n#### 4. Game Trees and Algorithms\n- **Alpha-Beta Pruning**: A search algorithm that reduces the number of nodes evaluated in a game tree by eliminating branches that cannot affect the final decision.\n- **SSS* Algorithm**: A state-space search algorithm that uses a best-first search strategy to explore the game tree.\n- **Horizon Nodes**: Nodes at the current depth level being evaluated in a game tree.\n- **Alpha-Cut and Beta-Cut**: Techniques used in Alpha-Beta pruning to eliminate branches.\n\n#### 5. Automated Planning\n- **Goal Stack Planning**: An algorithm for automated planning that uses a stack to keep track of subgoals.\n- **Predicates and Operators**: Definitions used to describe the state and actions in a planning problem.\n- **Optimal Plan**: A sequence of actions that achieves the goal with the least cost.\n\n### Equations\n1. **Sum of Geometric Series**:\n   \\[\n   \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} ar^k = \\frac{1 - a^n}{1 - a}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Heuristic Function for A***:\n   \\[\n   f(n) = g(n) + h(n)\n   \\]\n   where \\( g(n) \\) is the cost to reach node \\( n \\) and \\( h(n) \\) is the heuristic estimate of the cost from \\( n \\) to the goal.\n\n3. **Weighted A***:\n   \\[\n   f(n) = g(n) + w \\cdot h(n)\n   \\]\n   where \\( w \\) is the weight factor.\n\n### Knowledge Graph \n\n#### Search Algorithms\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    SearchAlgorithms-->BFS;\n    SearchAlgorithms-->BestFirstSearch;\n    SearchAlgorithms-->BranchAndBound;\n    SearchAlgorithms-->AStar;\n    SearchAlgorithms-->WeightedAStar;\n```\n\n#### Heuristics\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    Heuristics-->AdmissibleHeuristic;\n    Heuristics-->HeuristicFunction;\n```\n\n#### Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    TSP-->BranchAndBoundForTSP;\n    TSP-->LowerBound;\n    TSP-->UpperBound;\n```\n\n#### Game Trees and Algorithms\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    GameTreesAndAlgorithms-->AlphaBetaPruning;\n    GameTreesAndAlgorithms-->SSSStarAlgorithm;\n    GameTreesAndAlgorithms-->HorizonNodes;\n    GameTreesAndAlgorithms-->AlphaCut;\n    GameTreesAndAlgorithms-->BetaCut;\n```\n\n#### Automated Planning\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    AutomatedPlanning-->GoalStackPlanning;\n    AutomatedPlanning-->PredicatesAndOperators;\n    AutomatedPlanning-->OptimalPlan;\n```\n\n#### Relationships Between Topics\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    SearchAlgorithms-->Heuristics;\n    SearchAlgorithms-->TSP;\n    SearchAlgorithms-->GameTreesAndAlgorithms;\n    SearchAlgorithms-->AutomatedPlanning;\n    Heuristics-->TSP;\n    Heuristics-->GameTreesAndAlgorithms;\n    Heuristics-->AutomatedPlanning;\n    TSP-->GameTreesAndAlgorithms;\n    TSP-->AutomatedPlanning;\n    GameTreesAndAlgorithms-->AutomatedPlanning;\n```\n\nThis summary and knowledge graph should help you understand the core topics and their relationships, which are essential for the exam.",
