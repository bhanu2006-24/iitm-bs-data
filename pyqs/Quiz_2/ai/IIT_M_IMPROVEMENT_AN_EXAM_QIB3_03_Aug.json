Search Algorithms\n**Core Topics and Concepts:**\n- **Breadth-First Search (BFS):** Explores all neighbors at the present depth before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\n- **Best-First Search:** Uses an evaluation function to decide which node to expand next.\n- **Branch and Bound:** An algorithm for finding the shortest path in a graph, which uses a heuristic to guide the search.\n- **A* Algorithm:** Combines the benefits of BFS and Best-First Search using a cost function \\( f(n) = g(n) + h(n) \\), where \\( g(n) \\) is the cost to reach node \\( n \\) and \\( h(n) \\) is the heuristic estimate of the cost from \\( n \\) to the goal.\n- **Weighted A* (wA*):** A variant of A* where the heuristic is weighted by a factor \\( w \\).\n\n**Key Equations:**\n- **A* Algorithm:** \\( f(n) = g(n) + h(n) \\)\n- **Weighted A* Algorithm:** \\( f(n) = g(n) + w \\cdot h(n) \\)\n\n#### 2. Heuristics\n**Core Topics and Concepts:**\n- **Admissible Heuristic:** A heuristic that never overestimates the cost to reach the goal.\n- **Radial Distance Heuristic:** Uses the radial distance from the goal as the heuristic value.\n\n**Key Equations:**\n- **Admissible Heuristic:** \\( h(n) \\leq \\text{actual cost from } n \\text{ to goal} \\)\n\n#### 3. Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)\n**Core Topics and Concepts:**\n- **Branch and Bound for TSP:** Uses a search tree to explore possible tours and prunes branches that cannot lead to an optimal solution.\n- **Lower Bound:** The minimum possible cost of a tour.\n\n**Key Equations:**\n- **Lower Bound Calculation:** Sum of the minimum distances for each city.\n\n#### 4. Game Theory\n**Core Topics and Concepts:**\n- **Alpha-Beta Pruning:** A search algorithm that reduces the number of nodes evaluated in the search tree.\n- **Alpha-Cut and Beta-Cut:** Conditions used in Alpha-Beta pruning to cut off branches in the search tree.\n- **Horizon Nodes:** Nodes at the deepest level of the search tree.\n- **SSS* Algorithm:** A game-tree search algorithm that uses a heuristic to guide the search.\n\n**Key Equations:**\n- **Alpha-Beta Pruning:** \\( \\alpha \\) is the best value that the maximizer can guarantee, \\( \\beta \\) is the best value that the minimizer can guarantee.\n\n#### 5. Automated Planning\n**Core Topics and Concepts:**\n- **Goal Stack Planning:** An algorithm for automated planning that uses a stack to keep track of goals and subgoals.\n- **Predicates and Operators:** Definitions used in planning problems to describe the state and actions.\n- **Optimal Plan:** A sequence of actions that achieves the goal with the least cost.\n\n**Key Equations:**\n- **Goal Stack Planning:** Uses a stack to manage goals and subgoals, with actions pushed and popped based on preconditions and effects.\n\n### Mermaid Knowledge Graph\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[Search Algorithms] --> B[Breadth-First Search];\n    A --> C[Best-First Search];\n    A --> D[Branch and Bound];\n    A --> E[A* Algorithm];\n    A --> F[Weighted A* Algorithm];\n    G[Heuristics] --> H[Admissible Heuristic];\n    G --> I[Radial Distance Heuristic];\n    J[Traveling Salesman Problem] --> K[Branch and Bound for TSP];\n    J --> L[Lower Bound];\n    M[Game Theory] --> N[Alpha-Beta Pruning];\n    M --> O[Alpha-Cut and Beta-Cut];\n    M --> P[Horizon Nodes];\n    M --> Q[SSS* Algorithm];\n    R[Automated Planning] --> S[Goal Stack Planning];\n    R --> T[Predicates and Operators];\n    R --> U[Optimal Plan];\n```\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    B[Breadth-First Search] --> V[Explores all neighbors at present depth];\n    C[Best-First Search] --> W[Uses evaluation function];\n    D[Branch and Bound] --> X[Uses heuristic to guide search];\n    E[A* Algorithm] --> Y[Combines g(n) and h(n)];\n    F[Weighted A* Algorithm] --> Z[Uses weighted heuristic];\n    H[Admissible Heuristic] --> AA[Never overestimates cost];\n    I[Radial Distance Heuristic] --> AB[Uses radial distance];\n    K[Branch and Bound for TSP] --> AC[Explores possible tours];\n    L[Lower Bound] --> AD[Minimum possible cost];\n    N[Alpha-Beta Pruning] --> AE[Reduces nodes evaluated];\n    O[Alpha-Cut and Beta-Cut] --> AF[Conditions for pruning];\n    P[Horizon Nodes] --> AG[Deepest level nodes];\n    Q[SSS* Algorithm] --> AH[Uses heuristic to guide search];\n    S[Goal Stack Planning] --> AI[Uses stack for goals];\n    T[Predicates and Operators] --> AJ[Describe state and actions];\n    U[Optimal Plan] --> AK[Least cost sequence of actions];\n```\n\nThis summary and knowledge graph should help you understand the core topics, concepts, principles, and equations essential for the exam.",
