        "summary": "### Summary of Core Topics, Concepts, Principles, and Equations\n\n#### 1. Search Algorithms\n- **A* Algorithm**: A search algorithm that uses a heuristic function to estimate the cost of the cheapest path from a given node to the goal. It combines the cost to reach the node (g(n)) and the heuristic estimate (h(n)) to determine the next node to explore.\n  - **Equation**: \\( f(n) = g(n) + h(n) \\)\n  - **Heuristic Function**: Manhattan distance.\n  - **Tie-breaker**: Alphabetical order.\n\n- **WA* Algorithm**: A weighted version of the A* algorithm that uses a weight factor (w) to balance between the path cost and the heuristic estimate.\n  - **Equation**: \\( f(n) = g(n) + w \\times h(n) \\)\n\n- **Branch-and-Bound**: An algorithm for finding the shortest path by systematically exploring all possible paths and pruning paths that exceed the current best-known solution.\n  - **Lower Bound**: The minimum possible cost of a path.\n  - **Upper Bound**: The maximum possible cost of a path.\n\n#### 2. Heuristic Functions\n- **Manhattan Distance**: A heuristic function that calculates the distance between two points in a grid by summing the absolute differences of their coordinates.\n  - **Equation**: \\( h(n) = |x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2| \\)\n\n#### 3. Graph Representation\n- **Nodes and Edges**: Representation of a problem as a graph with nodes and edges, where edges have weights representing costs.\n- **Coordinates**: Nodes can have coordinates to help calculate heuristic values.\n\n#### 4. Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)\n- **Branch-and-Bound for TSP**: An algorithm to solve the TSP by systematically exploring all possible tours and pruning those that exceed the current best-known solution.\n  - **Lower Bound**: The minimum possible cost of a tour.\n  - **Upper Bound**: The maximum possible cost of a tour.\n  - **Permanent Segments**: Segments that are guaranteed to be part of the optimal tour.\n  - **Excluded Segments**: Segments that are guaranteed not to be part of the optimal tour.\n\n#### 5. Game Trees\n- **Minimax Algorithm**: An algorithm for decision-making in game theory, where the goal is to minimize the possible loss for a worst-case scenario.\n- **Alpha-Beta Pruning**: An optimization technique for the minimax algorithm that reduces the number of nodes evaluated in the search tree.\n- **Horizon Nodes**: Nodes at the deepest level of the search tree.\n- **SSS* Algorithm**: A state-space search algorithm that uses a heuristic function to guide the search.\n\n#### 6. Planning in AI\n- **Goal Stack Planning**: An algorithm for planning that uses a stack to keep track of subgoals and actions.\n- **Predicates and Operators**: Definitions of the state and actions in a planning problem.\n- **Optimal Plan**: A sequence of actions that achieves the goal with the minimum cost.\n\n### Knowledge Graph \n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[Search Algorithms] --> B[A* Algorithm];\n    A --> C[WA* Algorithm];\n    A --> D[Branch-and-Bound];\n    B --> E[Heuristic Function];\n    B --> F[Tie-breaker];\n    C --> E;\n    C --> G[Weight Factor];\n    D --> H[Lower Bound];\n    D --> I[Upper Bound];\n    E --> J[Manhattan Distance];\n    K[Graph Representation] --> L[Nodes and Edges];\n    K --> M[Coordinates];\n    N[TSP] --> O[Branch-and-Bound for TSP];\n    O --> P[Lower Bound];\n    O --> Q[Upper Bound];\n    O --> R[Permanent Segments];\n    O --> S[Excluded Segments];\n    T[Game Trees] --> U[Minimax Algorithm];\n    T --> V[Alpha-Beta Pruning];\n    T --> W[Horizon Nodes];\n    T --> X[SSS* Algorithm];\n    Y[Planning in AI] --> Z[Goal Stack Planning];\n    Y --> AA[Predicates and Operators];\n    Y --> AB[Optimal Plan];\n```\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[Search Algorithms] --> B[A* Algorithm];\n    A --> C[WA* Algorithm];\n    A --> D[Branch-and-Bound];\n    B --> E[Heuristic Function];\n    B --> F[Tie-breaker];\n    C --> E;\n    C --> G[Weight Factor];\n    D --> H[Lower Bound];\n    D --> I[Upper Bound];\n    E --> J[Manhattan Distance];\n```\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    K[Graph Representation] --> L[Nodes and Edges];\n    K --> M[Coordinates];\n    N[TSP] --> O[Branch-and-Bound for TSP];\n    O --> P[Lower Bound];\n    O --> Q[Upper Bound];\n    O --> R[Permanent Segments];\n    O --> S[Excluded Segments];\n```\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    T[Game Trees] --> U[Minimax Algorithm];\n    T --> V[Alpha-Beta Pruning];\n    T --> W[Horizon Nodes];\n    T --> X[SSS* Algorithm];\n```\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    Y[Planning in AI] --> Z[Goal Stack Planning];\n    Y --> AA[Predicates and Operators];\n    Y --> AB[Optimal Plan];\n```\n\nThis summary and the knowledge graphs should help you understand the core topics and their relationships, which are essential for the exam.",
