Key components include:\n  - **f(n) = g(n) + h(n)**: where g(n) is the cost from the start node to node n, and h(n) is the heuristic estimate from node n to the goal.\n  - **Tie-breaker**: Alphabetical order when nodes have the same best cost.\n- **WA* Algorithm**: Weighted A* algorithm that uses a weight factor to balance between path cost and heuristic.\n- **Branch-and-Bound**: An algorithm for finding the shortest path by systematically exploring all possible paths and discarding those that exceed the current best path cost.\n\n#### 2. Heuristic Functions\n- **Manhattan Distance**: A heuristic used in grid-based pathfinding.\n  - Formula: \\( |x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2| \\)\n\n#### 3. Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)\n- **Branch-and-Bound for TSP**: Used to find the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city.\n  - **Lower Bound**: Minimum possible cost of a tour.\n  - **Permanent Segments**: Segments that are permanently included or excluded in the search tree.\n\n#### 4. Game Theory\n- **Game Trees**: Used to represent possible moves in a game.\n  - **Evaluations**: W (win), D (draw), L (loss).\n  - **Alpha-Beta Pruning**: An optimization technique for minimizing the number of nodes evaluated in the search tree.\n  - **SSS* Algorithm**: A state-space search algorithm used in game trees.\n\n#### 5. Automated Planning\n- **Predicates and Operators**: Defined for a blocks-world domain.\n  - **Predicates**: `armEmpty`, `holding(X)`, `onTable(X)`, `clear(X)`, `on(X, Y)`.\n  - **Operators**: `Pickup(X)`, `Putdown(X)`, `Unstack(X, Y)`, `Stack(X, Y)`.\n- **Goal Stack Planning**: An algorithm for automated planning that uses a stack to keep track of goals and subgoals.\n\n### Knowledge Graph \n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[Search Algorithms] --> B[A* Algorithm]\n    A --> C[WA* Algorithm]\n    A --> D[Branch-and-Bound]\n    B --> E[f(n) = g(n) + h(n)]\n    B --> F[Manhattan Distance]\n    C --> G[Weight Factor]\n    D --> H[Shortest Path]\n    I[TSP] --> J[Branch-and-Bound for TSP]\n    J --> K[Lower Bound]\n    J --> L[Permanent Segments]\n    M[Game Theory] --> N[Game Trees]\n    N --> O[Evaluations]\n    N --> P[Alpha-Beta Pruning]\n    N --> Q[SSS* Algorithm]\n    R[Automated Planning] --> S[Predicates and Operators]\n    S --> T[armEmpty]\n    S --> U[holding(X)]\n    S --> V[onTable(X)]\n    S --> W[clear(X)]\n    S --> X[on(X, Y)]\n    R --> Y[Goal Stack Planning]\n```\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[Search Algorithms] --> B[A* Algorithm]\n    A --> C[WA* Algorithm]\n    A --> D[Branch-and-Bound]\n    B --> E[Heuristic Function]\n    E --> F[Manhattan Distance]\n    C --> G[Weight Factor]\n    D --> H[Path Cost]\n    I[TSP] --> J[Branch-and-Bound for TSP]\n    J --> K[Lower Bound]\n    J --> L[Permanent Segments]\n    M[Game Theory] --> N[Game Trees]\n    N --> O[Evaluations]\n    N --> P[Alpha-Beta Pruning]\n    N --> Q[SSS* Algorithm]\n    R[Automated Planning] --> S[Predicates]\n    S --> T[armEmpty]\n    S --> U[holding(X)]\n    S --> V[onTable(X)]\n    S --> W[clear(X)]\n    S --> X[on(X, Y)]\n    R --> Y[Operators]\n    Y --> Z[Pickup(X)]\n    Y --> AA[Putdown(X)]\n    Y --> AB[Unstack(X, Y)]\n    Y --> AC[Stack(X, Y)]\n    R --> AD[Goal Stack Planning]\n```\n\nThese graphs visually map the relationships between the core topics, concepts, and principles essential for the exam.",
