**Principle**: Uses a queue to keep track of the nodes to visit next.\n   - **Equation**: None specific, but involves traversal and queue operations.\n\n2. **Best-First Search**\n   - **Concept**: Explores the most promising node chosen according to a specified rule.\n   - **Principle**: Uses a priority queue to select the next node based on an evaluation function.\n   - **Equation**: Evaluation function \\( f(n) = g(n) + h(n) \\), where \\( g(n) \\) is the cost to reach node \\( n \\) and \\( h(n) \\) is the heuristic estimate to the goal.\n\n3. **Branch and Bound**\n   - **Concept**: A systematic method for solving optimization problems by implicitly enumerating all possible solutions.\n   - **Principle**: Uses bounding functions to eliminate large subsets of the solution space.\n   - **Equation**: None specific, but involves pruning based on bounds.\n\n4. **A* Algorithm**\n   - **Concept**: An informed search algorithm that uses a heuristic function to guide the search.\n   - **Principle**: Combines the benefits of Dijkstra's algorithm and Greedy Best-First Search.\n   - **Equation**: \\( f(n) = g(n) + h(n) \\), where \\( g(n) \\) is the cost to reach node \\( n \\) and \\( h(n) \\) is the heuristic estimate to the goal.\n\n5. **Weighted A* (wA*) Algorithm**\n   - **Concept**: A variant of A* that uses a weight to balance between the cost to reach the node and the heuristic estimate.\n   - **Principle**: Uses a weighted sum of the cost and heuristic to guide the search.\n   - **Equation**: \\( f(n) = g(n) + w \\cdot h(n) \\), where \\( w \\) is the weight.\n\n6. **Admissible Heuristic**\n   - **Concept**: A heuristic that never overestimates the cost to reach the goal.\n   - **Principle**: Ensures that the heuristic is optimistic and does not overestimate the actual cost.\n   - **Equation**: \\( h(n) \\leq h^*(n) \\), where \\( h^*(n) \\) is the actual cost to reach the goal from node \\( n \\).\n\n#### Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)\n1. **Branch and Bound for TSP**\n   - **Concept**: Uses a branching strategy to explore possible tours and bounding to eliminate suboptimal tours.\n   - **Principle**: Involves creating a search tree and using bounds to prune branches.\n   - **Equation**: None specific, but involves calculating lower bounds and pruning based on these bounds.\n\n2. **Lower Bound Calculation**\n   - **Concept**: Calculates the minimum possible cost of a tour.\n   - **Principle**: Uses the sum of the minimum edges to estimate the lower bound.\n   - **Equation**: Sum of the minimum edges for each node.\n\n#### Game Trees and Algorithms\n1. **Alpha-Beta Pruning**\n   - **Concept**: A search algorithm that reduces the number of nodes evaluated in the search tree.\n   - **Principle**: Uses alpha and beta values to prune branches that cannot affect the final decision.\n   - **Equation**: None specific, but involves updating alpha and beta values during traversal.\n\n2. **SSS* Algorithm**\n   - **Concept**: A state-space search algorithm that uses a linear space complexity.\n   - **Principle**: Involves maintaining a list of nodes and using a depth-first search strategy.\n   - **Equation**: None specific, but involves node selection and traversal.\n\n3. **Horizon Nodes**\n   - **Concept**: Nodes at the boundary of the search tree.\n   - **Principle**: Represents the current state of the search and potential future states.\n   - **Equation**: None specific.\n\n#### Automated Planning\n1. **Goal Stack Planning**\n   - **Concept**: A planning algorithm that uses a stack to keep track of goals and subgoals.\n   - **Principle**: Involves pushing and popping goals and subgoals to achieve the final goal.\n   - **Equation**: None specific, but involves stack operations and goal decomposition.\n\n2. **Blocks World Domain**\n   - **Concept**: A domain description for planning problems involving blocks and a robot arm.\n   - **Principle**: Involves predicates and operators to describe the state and actions in the blocks world.\n   -
