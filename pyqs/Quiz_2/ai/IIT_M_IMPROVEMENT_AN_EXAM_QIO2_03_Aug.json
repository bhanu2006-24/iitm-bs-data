Search Algorithms\n**Core Topics:**\n- Breadth-First Search (BFS)\n- Best-First Search\n- Branch and Bound\n- A* Algorithm\n- Weighted A* (wA*) Algorithm\n\n**Concepts and Principles:**\n- **BFS:** Explores all nodes at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\n- **Best-First Search:** Uses a priority queue to explore the most promising node first, based on a heuristic.\n- **Branch and Bound:** An algorithm for discrete and combinatorial optimization problems. It systematically enumerates candidate solutions by means of a tree structure.\n- **A* Algorithm:** Combines the benefits of BFS and Best-First Search by using a cost function `f(n) = g(n) + h(n)`, where `g(n)` is the cost to reach node `n` and `h(n)` is the heuristic estimate of the cost from `n` to the goal.\n- **wA* Algorithm:** A variant of A* where the heuristic is weighted by a factor `w` to control the trade-off between path quality and search time.\n\n**Equations:**\n- **A* Algorithm:** \\( f(n) = g(n) + h(n) \\)\n- **wA* Algorithm:** \\( f(n) = g(n) + w \\cdot h(n) \\)\n\n#### 2. Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)\n**Core Topics:**\n- Branch and Bound for TSP\n- Lower Bound Calculation\n- Search Tree Traversal\n\n**Concepts and Principles:**\n- **Branch and Bound for TSP:** Uses a search tree to explore possible tours, pruning branches that cannot lead to an optimal solution.\n- **Lower Bound Calculation:** Estimates the minimum possible cost of a tour to prune non-promising branches.\n- **Search Tree Traversal:** Systematically explores the search tree to find the optimal tour.\n\n**Equations:**\n- **Lower Bound Calculation:** Sum of the minimum outgoing edges from each node.\n\n#### 3. Game Theory\n**Core Topics:**\n- Alpha-Beta Pruning\n- SSS* Algorithm\n- Game Tree Traversal\n\n**Concepts and Principles:**\n- **Alpha-Beta Pruning:** A search algorithm that reduces the number of nodes evaluated in the search tree by pruning branches that cannot affect the final decision.\n- **SSS* Algorithm:** A variant of the Alpha-Beta algorithm that uses a more sophisticated pruning strategy.\n- **Game Tree Traversal:** Explores the game tree to determine the best move for a player.\n\n**Equations:**\n- **Alpha-Beta Pruning:** \\( \\alpha \\) (best value for MAX) and \\( \\beta \\) (best value for MIN) are used to prune branches.\n\n#### 4. Automated Planning\n**Core Topics:**\n- Goal Stack Planning\n- Blocks World Domain\n- Predicates and Operators\n\n**Concepts and Principles:**\n- **Goal Stack Planning:** A planning algorithm that uses a stack to keep track of subgoals and actions.\n- **Blocks World Domain:** A classic planning domain involving blocks that can be stacked and unstacked.\n- **Predicates and Operators:** Define the state of the world and the actions that can be taken.\n\n**Equations:**\n- **Goal Stack Planning:** Uses a stack to manage subgoals and actions, with tie-breakers to handle non-deterministic choices.\n\n### Knowledge Graph \n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[Search Algorithms] --> B[Breadth-First Search]\n    A --> C[Best-First Search]\n    A --> D[Branch and Bound]\n    A --> E[A* Algorithm]\n    A --> F[Weighted A* Algorithm]\n    G[Traveling Salesman Problem] --> H[Branch and Bound for TSP]\n    G --> I[Lower Bound Calculation]\n    G --> J[Search Tree Traversal]\n    K[Game Theory] --> L[Alpha-Beta Pruning]\n    K --> M[SSS* Algorithm]\n    K --> N[Game Tree Traversal]\n    O[Automated Planning] --> P[Goal Stack Planning]\n    O --> Q[Blocks World Domain]\n    O --> R[Predicates and Operators]\n```\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    B -->|Uses| S[Queue]\n    C -->|Uses| T[Priority Queue]\n    D -->|Uses| U[Tree Structure]\n    E -->|Uses| V[Cost Function]\n    F -->|Uses| W[Weighted Heuristic]\n    H -->|Uses| X[Search Tree]\n    I -->|Uses| Y[Minimum Outgoing Edges]\n    L -->|Uses| Z[Alpha and Beta Values]\n    M -->|Uses| AA[Sophisticated Pruning]\n    P -->|Uses| AB[Stack]\n    Q -->|Uses| AC[Blocks and Table]\n    R -->|Uses| AD[State and Actions]\n```\n\nThese graphs provide a visual representation of the relationships between the core topics, concepts, and principles discussed in the summary.",
