Search Algorithms\n- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Explores all neighbors at the present depth before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\n- **Best-First Search**: Uses a priority queue to explore the most promising node first, based on a given heuristic.\n- **Branch and Bound**: An algorithm for discrete and combinatorial optimization problems. It systematically enumerates candidate solutions and abandons a candidate (\"branches\") if it cannot possibly be better than the best solution found so far (\"bounds\").\n- **A* Algorithm**: Combines the benefits of BFS and Best-First Search by using a cost function `f(n) = g(n) + h(n)`, where `g(n)` is the cost to reach node `n` and `h(n)` is the heuristic estimate to reach the goal from node `n`.\n- **Weighted A* (wA*)**: A variant of A* where the heuristic is weighted by a factor `w`.\n\n#### 2. Heuristics\n- **Admissible Heuristic**: A heuristic that never overestimates the cost to reach the goal.\n- **Heuristic Function**: A function that estimates the cost from a given state to the goal state. For example, radial distance in a unit circle.\n\n#### 3. Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)\n- **Distance Matrix**: A matrix representing the distances between cities.\n- **Branch and Bound for TSP**: Uses a search tree to explore possible tours and prunes branches that cannot lead to an optimal solution.\n- **Lower Bound**: The minimum possible cost of a tour.\n- **Upper Bound**: The maximum possible cost of a tour.\n\n#### 4. Game Theory\n- **Alpha-Beta Pruning**: An optimization technique for the minimax algorithm that reduces the number of nodes evaluated in the search tree.\n- **Alpha-Cut and Beta-Cut**: Techniques used in Alpha-Beta pruning to eliminate branches in the search tree.\n- **Horizon Nodes**: Nodes at the deepest level of the search tree.\n- **SSS* Algorithm**: A state-space search algorithm that uses a heuristic to guide the search.\n\n#### 5. Automated Planning\n- **Predicates and Operators**: Definitions of actions and their preconditions and effects.\n- **Goal Stack Planning**: An algorithm that uses a stack to keep track of subgoals and actions.\n- **Optimal Plan**: A sequence of actions that achieves the goal with the least cost.\n\n### Knowledge Graph \n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[Search Algorithms] --> B[Breadth-First Search]\n    A --> C[Best-First Search]\n    A --> D[Branch and Bound]\n    A --> E[A* Algorithm]\n    A --> F[Weighted A*]\n    B --> G[Explores all neighbors]\n    C --> H[Uses priority queue]\n    D --> I[Systematic enumeration]\n    E --> J[Cost function f(n) = g(n) + h(n)]\n    F --> K[Weighted heuristic]\n\n    L[Heuristics] --> M[Admissible Heuristic]\n    L --> N[Heuristic Function]\n\n    O[Traveling Salesman Problem] --> P[Distance Matrix]\n    O --> Q[Branch and Bound for TSP]\n    O --> R[Lower Bound]\n    O --> S[Upper Bound]\n\n    T[Game Theory] --> U[Alpha-Beta Pruning]\n    T --> V[Alpha-Cut and Beta-Cut]\n    T --> W[Horizon Nodes]\n    T --> X[SSS* Algorithm]\n\n    Y[Automated Planning] --> Z[Predicates and Operators]\n    Y --> AA[Goal Stack Planning]\n    Y --> AB[Optimal Plan]\n```\n\n### Additional Knowledge Graph for Specific Concepts\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[Search Algorithms] --> B[Breadth-First Search]\n    A --> C[Best-First Search]\n    A --> D[Branch and Bound]\n    A --> E[A* Algorithm]\n    A --> F[Weighted A*]\n\n    B --> G[Explores all neighbors]\n    C --> H[Uses priority queue]\n    D --> I[Systematic enumeration]\n    E --> J[Cost function f(n) = g(n) + h(n)]\n    F --> K[Weighted heuristic]\n\n    L[Heuristics] --> M[Admissible Heuristic]\n    L --> N[Heuristic Function]\n\n    O[Traveling Salesman Problem] --> P[Distance Matrix]\n    O --> Q[Branch and Bound for TSP]\n    O --> R[Lower Bound]\n    O --> S[Upper Bound]\n\n    T[Game Theory] --> U[Alpha-Beta Pruning]\n    T --> V[Alpha-Cut and Beta-Cut]\n    T --> W[Horizon Nodes]\n    T --> X[SSS* Algorithm]\n\n    Y[Automated Planning] --> Z[Predicates and Operators]\n    Y --> AA[Goal Stack Planning]\n    Y --> AB[Optimal Plan]\n```\n\nThis summary and the knowledge graphs provide a clear and structured overview of the core topics, concepts, principles, and equations essential for the exam.",
