Search Algorithms\n- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Explores all nodes at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\n- **Best-First Search**: Uses an evaluation function to decide which node to expand next.\n- **Branch and Bound**: An algorithm for finding the shortest path in a graph, particularly useful in optimization problems.\n- **A* Algorithm**: Combines the benefits of BFS and Best-First Search using a heuristic function \\( f(n) = g(n) + h(n) \\), where \\( g(n) \\) is the cost to reach node \\( n \\) and \\( h(n) \\) is the heuristic estimate of the cost from \\( n \\) to the goal.\n- **Weighted A* Algorithm (wA*)**: A variant of A* where the heuristic function is weighted by a factor \\( w \\).\n\n#### 2. Heuristics\n- **Admissible Heuristic**: A heuristic that never overestimates the cost to reach the goal.\n- **Heuristic Function**: \\( h(n) \\), which estimates the cost from node \\( n \\) to the goal.\n\n#### 3. Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)\n- **Branch and Bound for TSP**: Uses a search tree to explore possible tours and prunes branches that cannot lead to an optimal solution.\n- **Lower Bound**: The minimum possible cost of a tour.\n- **Edge Selection**: Choosing edges to refine the search tree.\n\n#### 4. Game Theory\n- **Alpha-Beta Pruning**: A search algorithm that reduces the number of nodes evaluated in the search tree.\n- **Alpha-Cut and Beta-Cut**: Techniques used in Alpha-Beta pruning to eliminate branches in the search tree.\n- **SSS* Algorithm**: A state-space search algorithm used in game trees.\n- **Horizon Nodes**: Nodes at the deepest level of the search tree.\n\n#### 5. Automated Planning\n- **Goal Stack Planning**: An algorithm for automated planning that uses a stack to keep track of goals and subgoals.\n- **Predicates and Operators**: Definitions used in planning problems to describe the state and actions.\n- **Optimal Plan**: A sequence of actions that achieves the goal with the least cost.\n\n### Equations\n1. **Heuristic Function**:\n   \\[\n   f(n) = g(n) + h(n)\n   \\]\n   where \\( g(n) \\) is the cost to reach node \\( n \\) and \\( h(n) \\) is the heuristic estimate of the cost from \\( n \\) to the goal.\n\n2. **Weighted A* Heuristic Function**:\n   \\[\n   f(n) = g(n) + w \\cdot h(n)\n   \\]\n   where \\( w \\) is the weight factor.\n\n3. **Sum of Geometric Series**:\n   \\[\n   \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} ar^k = a \\frac{1 - r^n}{1 - r}\n   \\]\n   where \\( a \\) is the first term, \\( r \\) is the common ratio, and \\( n \\) is the number of terms.\n\n### Knowledge Graph \n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[Search Algorithms] --> B[Breadth-First Search]\n    A --> C[Best-First Search]\n    A --> D[Branch and Bound]\n    A --> E[A* Algorithm]\n    A --> F[Weighted A* Algorithm]\n    G[Heuristics] --> H[Admissible Heuristic]\n    G --> I[Heuristic Function]\n    J[Traveling Salesman Problem] --> K[Branch and Bound for TSP]\n    J --> L[Lower Bound]\n    J --> M[Edge Selection]\n    N[Game Theory] --> O[Alpha-Beta Pruning]\n    N --> P[Alpha-Cut and Beta-Cut]\n    N --> Q[SSS* Algorithm]\n    N --> R[Horizon Nodes]\n    S[Automated Planning] --> T[Goal Stack Planning]\n    S --> U[Predicates and Operators]\n    S --> V[Optimal Plan]\n```\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[Search Algorithms] --> B[Breadth-First Search]\n    A --> C[Best-First Search]\n    A --> D[Branch and Bound]\n    A --> E[A* Algorithm]\n    A --> F[Weighted A* Algorithm]\n    B --> G[Explores all nodes at present depth]\n    C --> H[Uses evaluation function]\n    D --> I[Finds shortest path]\n    E --> J[Combines BFS and Best-First Search]\n    F --> K[Weighted heuristic function]\n    L[Heuristics] --> M[Admissible Heuristic]\n    L --> N[Heuristic Function]\n    O[Traveling Salesman Problem] --> P[Branch and Bound for TSP]\n    O --> Q[Lower Bound]\n    O --> R[Edge Selection]\n    S[Game Theory] --> T[Alpha-Beta Pruning]\n    S --> U[Alpha-Cut and Beta-Cut]\n    S --> V[SSS* Algorithm]\n    S --> W[Horizon Nodes]\n    X[Automated Planning] --> Y[Goal Stack Planning]\n    X --> Z[Predicates and Operators]\n    X --> AA[Optimal Plan]\n```\n\nThese graphs provide a visual representation of the relationships between the core topics, concepts, and principles essential for the exam.",
