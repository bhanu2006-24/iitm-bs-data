Search Algorithms\n- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**\n  - Explores all neighbors at the present depth before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\n  - Guaranteed to find the shortest path in an unweighted graph.\n\n- **Best-First Search**\n  - Uses a priority queue to explore the most promising node first based on a heuristic.\n  - Heuristic function: \\( h(n) \\), which estimates the cost from node \\( n \\) to the goal.\n\n- **Branch and Bound**\n  - An algorithm for finding the shortest path by keeping track of the cost of the path and abandoning paths that exceed the current best path cost.\n  - Uses a priority queue to explore nodes based on the cost of the path so far.\n\n- **A* Algorithm**\n  - Combines the benefits of BFS and Best-First Search.\n  - Uses \\( f(n) = g(n) + h(n) \\), where \\( g(n) \\) is the cost from the start node to node \\( n \\), and \\( h(n) \\) is the heuristic estimate from node \\( n \\) to the goal.\n\n- **Weighted A* (wA*) Algorithm**\n  - A variant of A* where the heuristic is weighted by a factor \\( w \\).\n  - Uses \\( f(n) = g(n) + w \\cdot h(n) \\).\n\n- **Admissible Heuristic**\n  - A heuristic is admissible if it never overestimates the cost to reach the goal.\n  - For a heuristic \\( h(n) \\), it must satisfy \\( h(n) \\leq h^*(n) \\), where \\( h^*(n) \\) is the true cost to reach the goal from node \\( n \\).\n\n#### 2. Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)\n- **Branch and Bound for TSP**\n  - Uses a search tree to explore possible tours.\n  - Lower bound calculation to prune branches that cannot lead to an optimal solution.\n\n- **Lower Bound Calculation**\n  - For TSP, the lower bound can be calculated using the minimum edge weights.\n  - Example: \\( \\text{Lower Bound} = \\sum \\text{min edge weights} \\).\n\n#### 3. Game Trees and Algorithms\n- **Alpha-Beta Pruning**\n  - An optimization technique for the minimax algorithm.\n  - Uses alpha and beta values to prune branches that do not affect the final decision.\n  - Alpha: The best value that the maximizer currently can guarantee.\n  - Beta: The best value that the minimizer currently can guarantee.\n\n- **SSS* Algorithm**\n  - A state-space search algorithm that uses a combination of depth-first and best-first search.\n  - Uses a priority queue to explore the most promising nodes first.\n\n#### 4. Automated Planning\n- **Goal Stack Planning**\n  - A planning algorithm that uses a stack to keep track of goals and subgoals.\n  - Uses operators to achieve goals and subgoals.\n  - Tie-breakers: When actions are chosen non-deterministically, choose actions that lead to a plan.\n\n- **Blocks World Domain**\n  - Predicates: `armEmpty`, `holding(X)`, `onTable(X)`, `clear(X)`, `on(X, Y)`.\n  - Operators: `Pickup(X)`, `Putdown(X)`, `Unstack(X, Y)`, `Stack(X, Y)`.\n\n### Knowledge Graph \n\n#### Search Algorithms\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[Search Algorithms] --> B[Breadth-First Search];\n    A --> C[Best-First Search];\n    A --> D[Branch and Bound];\n    A --> E[A* Algorithm];\n    A --> F[Weighted A* Algorithm];\n    B --> G[Explores all neighbors at present depth];\n    C --> H[Uses heuristic function];\n    D --> I[Keeps track of path cost];\n    E --> J[Combines BFS and Best-First Search];\n    F --> K[Uses weighted heuristic];\n```\n\n#### Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    L[TSP] --> M[Branch and Bound];\n    M --> N[Search Tree];\n    M --> O[Lower Bound Calculation];\n    N --> P[Explores possible tours];\n    O --> Q[Uses minimum edge weights];\n```\n\n#### Game Trees and Algorithms\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    R[Game Trees] --> S[Alpha-Beta Pruning];\n    R --> T[SSS* Algorithm];\n    S --> U[Optimization for Minimax];\n    S --> V[Uses alpha and beta values];\n    T --> W[Combines depth-first and best-first search];\n```\n\n#### Automated Planning\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    X[Automated Planning] --> Y[Goal Stack Planning];\n    X --> Z[Blocks World Domain];\n    Y --> AA[Uses stack for goals and subgoals];\n    Z --> AB[Predicates and Operators];\n```\n\nThis summary and knowledge graph should help you understand the core topics and their relationships, which are essential for the exam.",
