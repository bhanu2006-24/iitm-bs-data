Search Algorithms\n**Core Topics:**\n- A* Search Algorithm\n- Weighted A* (WA*) Search Algorithm\n- Branch-and-Bound Algorithm\n\n**Concepts and Principles:**\n- **A* Search Algorithm:** Uses a heuristic function to estimate the cost of the cheapest path from the current node to the goal. The heuristic function used here is the Manhattan distance.\n  - **f(n) = g(n) + h(n)**\n    - **g(n):** Cost from the start node to the current node.\n    - **h(n):** Heuristic estimate of the cost from the current node to the goal.\n- **Weighted A* (WA*) Search Algorithm:** Similar to A* but includes a weight factor to control the trade-off between path cost and heuristic estimate.\n  - **f(n) = g(n) + w * h(n)**\n    - **w:** Weight factor.\n- **Branch-and-Bound Algorithm:** A systematic method for solving optimization problems by enumerating candidate solutions and abandoning a candidate (\"branching\") if it cannot possibly be better than the best candidate already found (\"bounding\").\n\n**Equations:**\n- **Manhattan Distance:** \\( h(n) = |x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2| \\)\n\n#### 2. Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)\n**Core Topics:**\n- TSP Branch-and-Bound Algorithm\n- Lower Bound Calculation\n- Permanent Segments in TSP\n\n**Concepts and Principles:**\n- **TSP Branch-and-Bound Algorithm:** Solves the TSP by systematically exploring possible tours and using bounds to eliminate suboptimal solutions.\n- **Lower Bound Calculation:** Estimates the minimum possible cost of a tour to prune the search tree.\n- **Permanent Segments:** Segments that are guaranteed to be part of the optimal tour.\n\n**Equations:**\n- **Lower Bound Calculation:** Sum of the minimum outgoing edges from each node plus the minimum incoming edges to each node.\n\n#### 3. Game Trees and Algorithms\n**Core Topics:**\n- Minimax Algorithm\n- Alpha-Beta Pruning\n- SSS* Algorithm\n\n**Concepts and Principles:**\n- **Minimax Algorithm:** A recursive algorithm for choosing the next move in an n-player game, usually a two-player game.\n- **Alpha-Beta Pruning:** An optimization technique for the minimax algorithm that reduces the number of nodes evaluated in the search tree.\n- **SSS* Algorithm:** A graph search algorithm that combines features of both breadth-first search and depth-first search.\n\n**Equations:**\n- **Minimax Value:** \\( \\text{minimax}(node, depth) = \\begin{cases}\n\\text{eval}(node) & \\text{if } depth = 0 \\\\\n\\max(\\text{minimax}(child, depth-1)) & \\text{if } node \\text{ is a max node} \\\\\n\\min(\\text{minimax}(child, depth-1)) & \\text{if } node \\text{ is a min node}\n\\end{cases} \\)\n\n#### 4. Automated Planning\n**Core Topics:**\n- Goal Stack Planning\n- Predicates and Operators\n- Applicable and Relevant Actions\n\n**Concepts and Principles:**\n- **Goal Stack Planning:** A planning algorithm that uses a stack to keep track of goals and subgoals.\n- **Predicates and Operators:** Define the state of the world and the actions that can be taken.\n- **Applicable and Relevant Actions:** Actions that can be executed in the current state and are relevant to achieving the goal.\n\n**Equations:**\n- **Preconditions and Effects:** Define the conditions under which an action can be taken and the changes it brings to the state.\n\n### Mermaid Knowledge Graph\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[Search Algorithms] --> B[A* Search Algorithm];\n    A --> C[Weighted A* Search Algorithm];\n    A --> D[Branch-and-Bound Algorithm];\n    B --> E[Heuristic Function];\n    B --> F[Manhattan Distance];\n    C --> G[Weight Factor];\n    D --> H[Optimization Problems];\n\n    I[Traveling Salesman Problem] --> J[TSP Branch-and-Bound Algorithm];\n    I --> K[Lower Bound Calculation];\n    I --> L[Permanent Segments];\n\n    M[Game Trees and Algorithms] --> N[Minimax Algorithm];\n    M --> O[Alpha-Beta Pruning];\n    M --> P[SSS* Algorithm];\n\n    Q[Automated Planning] --> R[Goal Stack Planning];\n    Q --> S[Predicates and Operators];\n    Q --> T[Applicable and Relevant Actions];\n```\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    E[Heuristic Function] --> F[Manhattan Distance];\n    N[Minimax Algorithm] --> O[Alpha-Beta Pruning];\n    J[TSP Branch-and-Bound Algorithm] --> K[Lower Bound Calculation];\n    R[Goal Stack Planning] --> S[Predicates and Operators];\n```\n\nThese graphs visually map the relationships between the core topics, concepts, and principles discussed in the exam questions.",
