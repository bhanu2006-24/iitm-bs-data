Search Algorithms\n- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Explores all neighbors at the present depth before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\n- **Best-First Search**: Uses an evaluation function to decide which node to expand next.\n- **Branch and Bound**: An algorithm for finding the shortest path by keeping track of the cost and using a priority queue.\n- **A* Algorithm**: Combines the benefits of Dijkstra's algorithm and Greedy Best-First Search using a heuristic function \\( f(n) = g(n) + h(n) \\), where \\( g(n) \\) is the cost from the start node to node \\( n \\), and \\( h(n) \\) is the heuristic estimate of the cost from node \\( n \\) to the goal.\n- **Weighted A* Algorithm (wA*)**: A variant of A* where the heuristic function is weighted by a factor \\( w \\).\n\n#### 2. Heuristics\n- **Admissible Heuristic**: A heuristic that never overestimates the cost to reach the goal.\n- **Heuristic Function**: \\( h(n) \\) estimates the cost from node \\( n \\) to the goal.\n\n#### 3. Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)\n- **Branch and Bound for TSP**: Uses a search tree to explore possible tours and prunes branches that cannot lead to an optimal solution.\n- **Lower Bound Calculation**: Uses the sum of the minimum edges to estimate the lower bound of the tour cost.\n\n#### 4. Game Theory and Algorithms\n- **Alpha-Beta Pruning**: An optimization technique for the minimax algorithm that reduces the number of nodes evaluated in the search tree.\n- **SSS* Algorithm**: A state-space search algorithm that uses a combination of forward and backward search.\n- **Horizon Nodes**: Nodes at the boundary of the search tree.\n- **Minimax Algorithm**: A recursive algorithm for choosing the next move in an n-player game, usually a two-player game.\n\n#### 5. Automated Planning\n- **Goal Stack Planning**: An algorithm that uses a stack to keep track of goals and subgoals.\n- **Predicates and Operators**: Definitions of actions and conditions in a planning domain.\n- **Optimal Plan**: A sequence of actions that achieves the goal with the least cost.\n\n### Knowledge Graph \n\n#### Search Algorithms\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    SearchAlgorithms --> BFS;\n    SearchAlgorithms --> BestFirstSearch;\n    SearchAlgorithms --> BranchAndBound;\n    SearchAlgorithms --> AStar;\n    SearchAlgorithms --> WeightedAStar;\n    AStar --> HeuristicFunction;\n    WeightedAStar --> HeuristicFunction;\n```\n\n#### Heuristics\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    Heuristics --> AdmissibleHeuristic;\n    Heuristics --> HeuristicFunction;\n    HeuristicFunction --> AStar;\n    HeuristicFunction --> WeightedAStar;\n```\n\n#### Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    TSP --> BranchAndBound;\n    BranchAndBound --> LowerBoundCalculation;\n    LowerBoundCalculation --> MinimumEdges;\n```\n\n#### Game Theory and Algorithms\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    GameTheory --> AlphaBetaPruning;\n    GameTheory --> SSSStarAlgorithm;\n    GameTheory --> MinimaxAlgorithm;\n    AlphaBetaPruning --> MinimaxAlgorithm;\n    SSSStarAlgorithm --> HorizonNodes;\n```\n\n#### Automated Planning\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    AutomatedPlanning --> GoalStackPlanning;\n    AutomatedPlanning --> PredicatesAndOperators;\n    AutomatedPlanning --> OptimalPlan;\n    GoalStackPlanning --> PredicatesAndOperators;\n    GoalStackPlanning --> OptimalPlan;\n```\n\n### Equations\n\n#### Heuristic Function\n\\[ f(n) = g(n) + h(n) \\]\n- \\( g(n) \\): Cost from the start node to node \\( n \\).\n- \\( h(n) \\): Heuristic estimate of the cost from node \\( n \\) to the goal.\n\n#### Weighted A* Algorithm\n\\[ f(n) = g(n) + w \\cdot h(n) \\]\n- \\( w \\): Weight factor.\n\n#### Lower Bound Calculation for TSP\n\\[ \\text{Lower Bound} = \\sum_{\\text{min edges}} \\]\n\n#### Alpha-Beta Pruning\n\\[ \\text{Alpha-Cut: } \\text{eval(child)} \\leq \\text{Alpha} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Beta-Cut: } \\text{Beta} \\leq \\text{eval(child)} \\]\n\nThis summary provides a clear and concise overview of the core topics, concepts, principles, and equations essential for the exam, along with a visual representation of the relationships between these topics.",
