        "summary": "### Summary of Core Topics, Concepts, Principles, and Equations\n\n#### 1. Search Algorithms\n- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Explores all nodes at the present depth before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\n- **Best-First Search**: Uses a priority queue to explore the most promising node first based on a given heuristic.\n- **Branch and Bound**: An algorithm for finding the shortest path by keeping track of the cost and using a priority queue.\n- **A* Algorithm**: Combines the benefits of BFS and Best-First Search using a heuristic function \\( f(n) = g(n) + h(n) \\), where \\( g(n) \\) is the cost from the start node to node \\( n \\), and \\( h(n) \\) is the heuristic estimate from node \\( n \\) to the goal.\n- **Weighted A* Algorithm (wA*)**: A variant of A* where the heuristic is weighted by a factor \\( w \\).\n\n#### 2. Heuristics\n- **Admissible Heuristic**: A heuristic is admissible if it never overestimates the cost to reach the goal.\n- **Radial Distance Heuristic**: Used in the context of a unit circle, where the heuristic value is the radial distance from the goal.\n\n#### 3. Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)\n- **Branch and Bound for TSP**: Uses a search tree to explore possible tours and prunes branches that cannot lead to an optimal solution.\n- **Lower Bound**: The minimum possible cost of a tour.\n- **Upper Bound**: The cost of the best tour found so far.\n\n#### 4. Game Theory\n- **Alpha-Beta Pruning**: An optimization technique for the minimax algorithm to reduce the number of nodes evaluated in the search tree.\n- **Horizon Effect**: The impact of the depth of the search tree on the decision-making process.\n- **SSS* Algorithm**: A game-tree search algorithm that uses a selective search strategy.\n\n#### 5. Automated Planning\n- **Goal Stack Planning**: A planning algorithm that uses a stack to keep track of goals and subgoals.\n- **Predicates and Operators**: Definitions of actions and conditions in a planning domain.\n- **Optimal Plan**: A sequence of actions that achieves the goal with the least cost.\n\n#### 6. Mathematical Concepts\n- **Geometric Series**: The sum of a geometric series \\( \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} ar^k = a \\frac{1 - r^n}{1 - r} \\).\n\n### Knowledge Graph \n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    SearchAlgorithms-->BFS;\n    SearchAlgorithms-->BestFirstSearch;\n    SearchAlgorithms-->BranchAndBound;\n    SearchAlgorithms-->AStar;\n    SearchAlgorithms-->WeightedAStar;\n    Heuristics-->AdmissibleHeuristic;\n    Heuristics-->RadialDistanceHeuristic;\n    TSP-->BranchAndBoundTSP;\n    TSP-->LowerBound;\n    TSP-->UpperBound;\n    GameTheory-->AlphaBetaPruning;\n    GameTheory-->HorizonEffect;\n    GameTheory-->SSSStarAlgorithm;\n    AutomatedPlanning-->GoalStackPlanning;\n    AutomatedPlanning-->PredicatesAndOperators;\n    AutomatedPlanning-->OptimalPlan;\n    MathematicalConcepts-->GeometricSeries;\n```\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    AStar-->Heuristics;\n    WeightedAStar-->Heuristics;\n    BranchAndBoundTSP-->TSP;\n    AlphaBetaPruning-->GameTheory;\n    SSSStarAlgorithm-->GameTheory;\n    GoalStackPlanning-->AutomatedPlanning;\n```\n\nThese graphs visually map the relationships between the core topics, concepts, and principles essential for the exam.",
