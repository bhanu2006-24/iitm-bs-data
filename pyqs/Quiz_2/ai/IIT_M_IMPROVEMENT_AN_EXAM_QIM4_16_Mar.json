Search Algorithms\n**Core Topics:**\n- A* Search Algorithm\n- Weighted A* (WA*) Search Algorithm\n- Branch-and-Bound Algorithm\n- Manhattan Distance Heuristic\n\n**Concepts and Principles:**\n- **A* Search Algorithm:** Uses a heuristic function to estimate the cost of the cheapest path from the current node to the goal. It combines the cost to reach the node (g(n)) and the heuristic estimate (h(n)) to form the total estimated cost (f(n) = g(n) + h(n)).\n- **Weighted A* (WA*) Search Algorithm:** Similar to A* but includes a weight factor (w) to balance between path cost and heuristic estimate.\n- **Branch-and-Bound Algorithm:** A systematic method for solving optimization problems by enumerating candidate solutions and abandoning a candidate (\"branching\") if it cannot possibly lead to a better solution than the best one found so far (\"bounding\").\n- **Manhattan Distance Heuristic:** A heuristic that estimates the distance between two points in a grid based on the sum of the absolute differences of their coordinates.\n\n**Equations:**\n- **A* Algorithm:**\n  \\[\n  f(n) = g(n) + h(n)\n  \\]\n  where \\( g(n) \\) is the cost to reach node \\( n \\) from the start node, and \\( h(n) \\) is the heuristic estimate of the cost from node \\( n \\) to the goal.\n\n- **Manhattan Distance:**\n  \\[\n  h(n) = |x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|\n  \\]\n  where \\( (x_1, y_1) \\) and \\( (x_2, y_2) \\) are the coordinates of the current node and the goal node, respectively.\n\n#### 2.
