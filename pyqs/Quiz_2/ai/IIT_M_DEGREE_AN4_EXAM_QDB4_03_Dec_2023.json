The locations are at grid points and are connected by two way edges (roads), where each edge has a cost that is the same in both directions. Observe that the edge costs are not necessarily proportional to the coordinate based distance estimates.   The start node is S and the goal node is G, the MoveGen function returns neighbours in alphabetical order. Use Manhattan distance as the heuristic function.  Tie-breaker: when several nodes have the same best cost, use alphabetical order to break ties.  ",
