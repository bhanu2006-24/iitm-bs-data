Search Algorithms\n- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Explores all nodes at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\n- **Best-First Search**: Uses an evaluation function to decide which node to expand next.\n- **Branch and Bound**: An algorithm for finding optimal solutions by systematically enumerating candidate solutions and abandoning a candidate (\"branching\") if it cannot possibly be better than the best candidate already found (\"bounding\").\n- **A\\* Algorithm**: Combines the benefits of Dijkstra's algorithm and Greedy Best-First Search. It uses a heuristic function to guide its search.\n- **Weighted A\\* Algorithm (wA\\*)**: A variant of A\\* that uses a weight to balance between the cost and the heuristic.\n\n#### 2. Heuristics\n- **Admissible Heuristic**: A heuristic that never overestimates the cost to reach the goal.\n- **Heuristic Function**: A function that estimates the cost from a given state to the goal state.\n\n#### 3. Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)\n- **Branch and Bound for TSP**: Uses a search tree to explore possible tours and prunes branches that cannot lead to an optimal solution.\n- **Lower Bound**: The minimum possible cost of a tour.\n- **Upper Bound**: The cost of the best tour found so far.\n\n#### 4. Game Theory\n- **Alpha-Beta Pruning**: A search algorithm that reduces the number of nodes evaluated in the search tree.\n- **Alpha-Cut and Beta-Cut**: Techniques used in Alpha-Beta pruning to eliminate branches in the search tree.\n- **SSS\\* Algorithm**: A state-space search algorithm that uses a heuristic to guide the search.\n\n#### 5. Automated Planning\n- **Goal Stack Planning**: An algorithm for automated planning that uses a stack to keep track of goals and subgoals.\n- **Predicates and Operators**: Definitions used in planning problems to describe the state and actions.\n- **Optimal Plan**: A plan that achieves the goal with the minimum number of actions.\n\n### Equations\n#### Heuristic Function\n- **A\\* Algorithm**: \\( f(n) = g(n) + h(n) \\)\n  - \\( g(n) \\): Cost from the start node to node \\( n \\).\n  - \\( h(n) \\): Heuristic estimate of the cost from node \\( n \\) to the goal.\n\n#### Sum of Geometric Series\n- **Sum of Geometric Series**: \\( \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} ar^k = a \\frac{1 - r^n}{1 - r} \\)\n\n### Knowledge Graph \n\n#### Search Algorithms\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    SearchAlgorithms-->BFS;\n    SearchAlgorithms-->BestFirstSearch;\n    SearchAlgorithms-->BranchAndBound;\n    SearchAlgorithms-->AStar;\n    SearchAlgorithms-->WeightedAStar;\n```\n\n#### Heuristics\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    Heuristics-->AdmissibleHeuristic;\n    Heuristics-->HeuristicFunction;\n```\n\n#### Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    TSP-->BranchAndBound;\n    TSP-->LowerBound;\n    TSP-->UpperBound;\n```\n\n#### Game Theory\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    GameTheory-->AlphaBetaPruning;\n    GameTheory-->AlphaCut;\n    GameTheory-->BetaCut;\n    GameTheory-->SSSStar;\n```\n\n#### Automated Planning\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    AutomatedPlanning-->GoalStackPlanning;\n    AutomatedPlanning-->PredicatesAndOperators;\n    AutomatedPlanning-->OptimalPlan;\n```\n\n#### Relationships Between Topics\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    SearchAlgorithms-->Heuristics;\n    SearchAlgorithms-->TSP;\n    SearchAlgorithms-->GameTheory;\n    SearchAlgorithms-->AutomatedPlanning;\n    Heuristics-->AStar;\n    Heuristics-->WeightedAStar;\n    TSP-->BranchAndBound;\n    GameTheory-->AlphaBetaPruning;\n    AutomatedPlanning-->GoalStackPlanning;\n```\n\nThis summary and knowledge graph should help you understand the core topics and their relationships, which are essential for the exam.",
