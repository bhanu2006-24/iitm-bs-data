The heuristic function used here is the Manhattan distance.\n  - **Equation**: \\( f(n) = g(n) + h(n) \\)\n    - \\( g(n) \\): Cost from the start node to node \\( n \\).\n    - \\( h(n) \\): Heuristic estimate from node \\( n \\) to the goal.\n- **WA* Algorithm**: Weighted A* algorithm that uses a weight \\( w \\) to balance between path cost and heuristic.\n  - **Equation**: \\( f(n) = g(n) + w \\cdot h(n) \\)\n- **Branch-and-Bound**: An algorithm for finding the shortest path by systematically enumerating all candidate solutions and pruning those that exceed the current best solution.\n\n#### 2. Heuristic Functions\n- **Manhattan Distance**: A heuristic that calculates the distance between two points in a grid.\n  - **Equation**: \\( |x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2| \\)\n\n#### 3. Graph Representation\n- **Nodes and Edges**: Representation of locations and paths between them.\n- **Adjacency List**: A collection of unordered lists used to represent a finite graph.\n\n#### 4. Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)\n- **Branch-and-Bound for TSP**: An algorithm to find the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city.\n  - **Lower Bound Calculation**: Sum of the minimum distances from each city to its nearest neighbors.\n\n#### 5. Game Trees\n- **Minimax Algorithm**: Used for decision-making in game theory, minimizing the possible loss for a worst-case scenario.\n- **Alpha-Beta Pruning**: An optimization technique for the minimax algorithm that reduces the number of nodes evaluated.\n- **SSS* Algorithm**: A state-space search algorithm that uses heuristic evaluation functions to guide the search.\n\n#### 6. Automated Planning\n- **Predicates and Operators**: Definitions of actions and conditions in a planning domain.\n- **Goal Stack Planning**: An algorithm that uses a stack to keep track of subgoals and actions to achieve a goal state.\n\n### Knowledge Graph \n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[Search Algorithms] --> B[A* Algorithm]\n    A --> C[WA* Algorithm]\n    A --> D[Branch-and-Bound]\n    B --> E[Heuristic Function]\n    E --> F[Manhattan Distance]\n    C --> E\n    D --> E\n    G[Graph Representation] --> H[Nodes and Edges]\n    G --> I[Adjacency List]\n    J[TSP] --> K[Branch-and-Bound for TSP]\n    K --> L[Lower Bound Calculation]\n    M[Game Trees] --> N[Minimax Algorithm]\n    M --> O[Alpha-Beta Pruning]\n    M --> P[SSS* Algorithm]\n    Q[Automated Planning] --> R[Predicates and Operators]\n    Q --> S[Goal Stack Planning]\n```\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[Search Algorithms] --> B[Graph Representation]\n    A --> C[Game Trees]\n    A --> D[Automated Planning]\n    B --> E[Nodes and Edges]\n    B --> F[Adjacency List]\n    C --> G[Minimax Algorithm]\n    C --> H[Alpha-Beta Pruning]\n    C --> I[SSS* Algorithm]\n    D --> J[Predicates and Operators]\n    D --> K[Goal Stack Planning]\n```\n\nThese graphs visually map the relationships between the core topics, providing a clear and easy-to-understand format.",
