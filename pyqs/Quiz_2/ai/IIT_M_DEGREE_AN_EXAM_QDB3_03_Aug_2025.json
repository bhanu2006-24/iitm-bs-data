Search Algorithms\n- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Explores all nodes at the present depth before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\n- **Best-First Search**: Uses a priority queue to explore the most promising node first, based on a given heuristic.\n- **Branch and Bound**: An algorithm for finding optimal solutions by systematically enumerating candidate solutions and abandoning a candidate (\"branching\") if it cannot possibly be better than the best candidate already found (\"bounding\").\n- **A* Algorithm**: Combines the benefits of BFS and Best-First Search by using a cost function \\( f(n) = g(n) + h(n) \\), where \\( g(n) \\) is the cost to reach node \\( n \\) and \\( h(n) \\) is the heuristic estimate of the cost from \\( n \\) to the goal.\n- **Weighted A* (wA*)**: A variant of A* where the heuristic is weighted by a factor \\( w \\).\n\n#### 2. Heuristics\n- **Admissible Heuristic**: A heuristic that never overestimates the cost to reach the goal.\n- **Radial Distance Heuristic**: Used in the context of a unit circle, where the heuristic value is the radial distance from the goal.\n\n#### 3. Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)\n- **Branch and Bound for TSP**: Uses a search tree to explore possible tours, with lower bounds and pruning to eliminate suboptimal paths.\n- **Lower Bound**: The minimum possible cost of a tour.\n- **Upper Bound**: The cost of the best tour found so far.\n\n#### 4. Game Theory\n- **Alpha-Beta Pruning**: A search algorithm that reduces the number of nodes evaluated in the search tree by the minimax algorithm.\n- **Alpha-Cut and Beta-Cut**: Techniques used in Alpha-Beta pruning to eliminate branches in the search tree.\n- **SSS* Algorithm**: A state-space search algorithm that uses a combination of depth-first and best-first search strategies.\n\n#### 5. Automated Planning\n- **Goal Stack Planning**: An algorithm for automated planning that uses a stack to keep track of subgoals.\n- **Predicates and Operators**: Definitions used in planning problems to describe the state and actions.\n- **Optimal Plan**: A sequence of actions that achieves the goal with the least cost.\n\n#### 6. Mathematical Concepts\n- **Geometric Series**: The sum of a geometric series \\( \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} ar^k = \\frac{1 - r^n}{1 - r} \\).\n\n### Knowledge Graph \n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[Search Algorithms] --> B[Breadth-First Search];\n    A --> C[Best-First Search];\n    A --> D[Branch and Bound];\n    A --> E[A* Algorithm];\n    A --> F[Weighted A*];\n    B --> G[Explores all nodes at present depth];\n    C --> H[Uses priority queue];\n    D --> I[Systematic enumeration];\n    E --> J[Cost function f(n) = g(n) + h(n)];\n    F --> K[Weighted heuristic];\n    L[Heuristics] --> M[Admissible Heuristic];\n    L --> N[Radial Distance Heuristic];\n    O[Traveling Salesman Problem] --> P[Branch and Bound for TSP];\n    O --> Q[Lower Bound];\n    O --> R[Upper Bound];\n    S[Game Theory] --> T[Alpha-Beta Pruning];\n    S --> U[Alpha-Cut and Beta-Cut];\n    S --> V[SSS* Algorithm];\n    W[Automated Planning] --> X[Goal Stack Planning];\n    W --> Y[Predicates and Operators];\n    W --> Z[Optimal Plan];\n    AA[Mathematical Concepts] --> AB[Geometric Series];\n```\n\n### Additional Knowledge Graph for Specific Algorithms\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[A*] --> B[Best-First Search];\n    A --> C[Breadth-First Search];\n    A --> D[Heuristic];\n    D --> E[Admissible Heuristic];\n    D --> F[Radial Distance Heuristic];\n    G[Branch and Bound] --> H[Systematic Enumeration];\n    G --> I[Pruning];\n    J[Traveling Salesman Problem] --> K[Branch and Bound for TSP];\n    J --> L[Lower Bound];\n    J --> M[Upper Bound];\n    N[Game Theory] --> O[Alpha-Beta Pruning];\n    N --> P[Alpha-Cut];\n    N --> Q[Beta-Cut];\n    N --> R[SSS* Algorithm];\n    S[Automated Planning] --> T[Goal Stack Planning];\n    S --> U[Predicates];\n    S --> V[Operators];\n    S --> W[Optimal Plan];\n```\n\nThis summary and the knowledge graphs should help you understand the core topics and their relationships, which are essential for the exam.",
