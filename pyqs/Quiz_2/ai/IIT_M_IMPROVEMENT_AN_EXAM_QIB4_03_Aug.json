Search Algorithms\n- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Explores all nodes at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\n- **Best-First Search**: Uses an evaluation function to decide which node to expand next.\n- **Branch and Bound**: An algorithm for finding optimal solutions by systematically enumerating candidate solutions and abandoning a candidate (\"branching\") if it cannot possibly lead to a better solution than the best one found so far (\"bounding\").\n- **A\\* Algorithm**: Combines the benefits of Dijkstra's algorithm and Greedy Best-First Search by using a heuristic function to guide the search.\n- **Weighted A\\* (wA\\*)**: A variant of A\\* where the heuristic function is weighted to balance between path cost and heuristic value.\n\n#### 2. Heuristics\n- **Admissible Heuristic**: A heuristic that never overestimates the cost to reach the goal.\n- **Heuristic Function**: A function that estimates the cost of the cheapest path from a given node to the goal.\n\n#### 3. Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)\n- **Branch and Bound for TSP**: Uses a search tree to explore possible tours and prunes branches that cannot lead to an optimal solution.\n- **Lower Bound**: The minimum possible cost of a tour, used to prune branches in the search tree.\n- **Edge Selection**: Choosing edges to include or exclude in the tour based on the lower bound and current best solution.\n\n#### 4. Game Theory\n- **Alpha-Beta Pruning**: A search algorithm that reduces the number of nodes evaluated in the search tree by using alpha and beta values to prune branches.\n- **Alpha-Cut and Beta-Cut**: Techniques used in Alpha-Beta pruning to eliminate branches that cannot influence the final decision.\n- **SSS\\* Algorithm**: A state-space search algorithm that uses a heuristic function to guide the search and prune branches.\n\n#### 5. Automated Planning\n- **Goal Stack Planning**: An algorithm for automated planning that uses a stack to keep track of subgoals and actions.\n- **Predicates and Operators**: Definitions of the state and actions in a planning domain.\n- **Optimal Plan**: A sequence of actions that achieves the goal with the minimum cost.\n\n### Equations\n#### Heuristic Function\n- **A\\* Algorithm**: \\( f(n) = g(n) + h(n) \\)\n  - \\( g(n) \\): Cost from the start node to node \\( n \\).\n  - \\( h(n) \\): Heuristic estimate of the cost from node \\( n \\) to the goal.\n\n#### Sum of Geometric Series\n- **Sum of Geometric Series**: \\( S_n = \\frac{1 - a^n}{1 - a} \\)\n\n### Knowledge Graph \n\n#### Search Algorithms\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    SearchAlgorithms --> BFS;\n    SearchAlgorithms --> BestFirstSearch;\n    SearchAlgorithms --> BranchAndBound;\n    SearchAlgorithms --> AStar;\n    SearchAlgorithms --> WeightedAStar;\n    BFS --> ExploresAllNodes;\n    BestFirstSearch --> UsesEvaluationFunction;\n    BranchAndBound --> SystematicEnumeration;\n    AStar --> CombinesDijkstraAndGreedy;\n    WeightedAStar --> BalancesPathCostAndHeuristic;\n```\n\n#### Heuristics\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    Heuristics --> AdmissibleHeuristic;\n    Heuristics --> HeuristicFunction;\n    AdmissibleHeuristic --> NeverOverestimatesCost;\n    HeuristicFunction --> EstimatesCostToGoal;\n```\n\n#### Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    TSP --> BranchAndBoundForTSP;\n    TSP --> LowerBound;\n    TSP --> EdgeSelection;\n    BranchAndBoundForTSP --> SearchTree;\n    LowerBound --> MinimumPossibleCost;\n    EdgeSelection --> IncludeExcludeEdges;\n```\n\n#### Game Theory\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    GameTheory --> AlphaBetaPruning;\n    GameTheory --> AlphaCut;\n    GameTheory --> BetaCut;\n    GameTheory --> SSSStarAlgorithm;\n    AlphaBetaPruning --> ReducesNodesEvaluated;\n    AlphaCut --> EliminatesBranches;\n    BetaCut --> EliminatesBranches;\n    SSSStarAlgorithm --> HeuristicGuidedSearch;\n```\n\n#### Automated Planning\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    AutomatedPlanning --> GoalStackPlanning;\n    AutomatedPlanning --> PredicatesAndOperators;\n    AutomatedPlanning --> OptimalPlan;\n    GoalStackPlanning --> SubgoalsAndActions;\n    PredicatesAndOperators --> StateAndActions;\n    OptimalPlan --> MinimumCostPlan;\n```\n\nThis summary and knowledge graph should help you understand the core topics, concepts, principles, and equations essential for the exam.",
