Search Algorithms\n- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Explores all neighbors at the present depth before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\n- **Best-First Search**: Uses an evaluation function to decide which node to expand next.\n- **Branch and Bound**: An algorithm for finding the shortest path by keeping track of the cost and using a priority queue.\n- **A* Algorithm**: Combines the benefits of BFS and Dijkstra's algorithm using a heuristic function \\( f(n) = g(n) + h(n) \\), where \\( g(n) \\) is the cost from the start node to node \\( n \\), and \\( h(n) \\) is the heuristic estimate from node \\( n \\) to the goal.\n- **Weighted A* Algorithm (wA*)**: A variant of A* where the heuristic function is multiplied by a weight \\( w \\).\n\n#### 2. Heuristics\n- **Admissible Heuristic**: A heuristic that never overestimates the cost to reach the goal.\n- **Radial Distance**: Used as a heuristic value in the given problems.\n\n#### 3. Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)\n- **Branch and Bound for TSP**: A method to find the shortest possible tour by systematically exploring possible paths and eliminating those that exceed the current best solution.\n- **Lower Bound Calculation**: Essential for pruning branches in the search tree.\n\n#### 4. Game Theory\n- **Alpha-Beta Pruning**: An optimization technique for the minimax algorithm to reduce the number of nodes evaluated in the search tree.\n- **SSS* Algorithm**: A state-space search algorithm used in game trees.\n- **Horizon Nodes**: Nodes at the boundary of the search tree.\n\n#### 5. Automated Planning\n- **Goal Stack Planning**: An algorithm for automated planning that uses a stack to keep track of goals and subgoals.\n- **Predicates and Operators**: Definitions of actions and conditions in a planning domain.\n- **Optimal Plan**: A sequence of actions that achieves the goal with the least cost.\n\n### Equations\n1. **Sum of Geometric Series**:\n   \\[\n   \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} ar^k = \\frac{1 - a^n}{1 - a}\n   \\]\n   This equation is used to calculate the sum of a geometric series, which is relevant in various search algorithms and heuristic calculations.\n\n2. **Heuristic Function for A***:\n   \\[\n   f(n) = g(n) + h(n)\n   \\]\n   Where \\( g(n) \\) is the cost from the start node to node \\( n \\), and \\( h(n) \\) is the heuristic estimate from node \\( n \\) to the goal.\n\n3. **Weighted A* Heuristic Function**:\n   \\[\n   f(n) = g(n) + w \\cdot h(n)\n   \\]\n   Where \\( w \\) is a weight factor that influences the balance between the heuristic and the actual cost.\n\n### Knowledge Graph \n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[Search Algorithms] --> B[Breadth-First Search];\n    A --> C[Best-First Search];\n    A --> D[Branch and Bound];\n    A --> E[A* Algorithm];\n    A --> F[Weighted A* Algorithm];\n    B --> G[Explores all neighbors at present depth];\n    C --> H[Uses evaluation function];\n    D --> I[Keeps track of cost];\n    E --> J[Combines BFS and Dijkstra's algorithm];\n    F --> K[Multiplies heuristic by weight];\n\n    L[Heuristics] --> M[Admissible Heuristic];\n    L --> N[Radial Distance];\n\n    O[Traveling Salesman Problem] --> P[Branch and Bound for TSP];\n    O --> Q[Lower Bound Calculation];\n\n    R[Game Theory] --> S[Alpha-Beta Pruning];\n    R --> T[SSS* Algorithm];\n    R --> U[Horizon Nodes];\n\n    V[Automated Planning] --> W[Goal Stack Planning];\n    V --> X[Predicates and Operators];\n    V --> Y[Optimal Plan];\n\n    M --> Z[Never overestimates cost];\n    N --> AA[Used in heuristic calculations];\n\n    P --> AB[Finds shortest possible tour];\n    Q --> AC[Essential for pruning branches];\n\n    S --> AD[Reduces number of nodes evaluated];\n    T --> AE[State-space search algorithm];\n    U --> AF[Nodes at boundary of search tree];\n\n    W --> AG[Uses stack for goals and subgoals];\n    X --> AH[Definitions of actions and conditions];\n    Y --> AI[Achieves goal with least cost];\n```\n\n### Additional Knowledge Graph for Specific Concepts\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[Search Algorithms] --> B[Breadth-First Search];\n    A --> C[Best-First Search];\n    A --> D[Branch and Bound];\n    A --> E[A* Algorithm];\n    A --> F[Weighted A* Algorithm];\n\n    B --> G[Explores all neighbors at present depth];\n    C --> H[Uses evaluation function];\n    D --> I[Keeps track of cost];\n    E --> J[Combines BFS and Dijkstra's algorithm];\n    F --> K[Multiplies heuristic by weight];\n\n    L[Heuristics] --> M[Admissible Heuristic];\n    L --> N[Radial Distance];\n\n    O[Traveling Salesman Problem] --> P[Branch and Bound for TSP];\n    O --> Q[Lower Bound Calculation];\n\n    R[Game Theory] --> S[Alpha-Beta Pruning];\n    R --> T[SSS* Algorithm];\n    R --> U[Horizon Nodes];\n\n    V[Automated Planning] --> W[Goal Stack Planning];\n    V --> X[Predicates and Operators];\n    V --> Y[Optimal Plan];\n\n    M --> Z[Never overestimates cost];\n    N --> AA[Used in heuristic calculations];\n\n    P --> AB[Finds shortest possible tour];\n    Q --> AC[Essential for pruning branches];\n\n    S --> AD[Reduces number of nodes evaluated];\n    T --> AE[State-space search algorithm];\n    U --> AF[Nodes at boundary of search tree];\n\n    W --> AG[Uses stack for goals and subgoals];\n    X --> AH[Definitions of actions and conditions];\n    Y --> AI[Achieves goal with least cost];\n```\n\nThis summary and the knowledge graphs provide a clear and structured overview of the core topics, concepts, principles, and equations essential for the exam.",
