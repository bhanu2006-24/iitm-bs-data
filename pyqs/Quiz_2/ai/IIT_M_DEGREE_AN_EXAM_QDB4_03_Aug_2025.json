Search Algorithms\n- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Explores all nodes at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\n- **Best-First Search**: Uses a priority queue to explore the most promising node first, based on a given heuristic.\n- **Branch and Bound**: An algorithm for finding optimal solutions by systematically enumerating candidate solutions and abandoning a candidate (\"branching\") if it cannot possibly be better than the best candidate already found (\"bounding\").\n- **A* Algorithm**: Combines the benefits of BFS and Best-First Search by using a cost function \\( f(n) = g(n) + h(n) \\), where \\( g(n) \\) is the cost to reach node \\( n \\) and \\( h(n) \\) is the heuristic estimate of the cost from \\( n \\) to the goal.\n- **Weighted A* Algorithm (wA*)**: A variant of A* where the heuristic is weighted by a factor \\( w \\).\n\n#### 2. Heuristics\n- **Admissible Heuristic**: A heuristic that never overestimates the cost to reach the goal. For a heuristic \\( h(n) \\), it must satisfy \\( h(n) \\leq h^*(n) \\), where \\( h^*(n) \\) is the true cost to reach the goal from node \\( n \\).\n\n#### 3. Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)\n- **Branch and Bound for TSP**: Uses a search tree to explore possible tours, with lower bounds to prune branches that cannot lead to an optimal solution.\n- **Lower Bound Calculation**: The lower bound on the cost of a tour can be calculated using the sum of the minimum outgoing edges from each node.\n\n#### 4. Game Theory\n- **Alpha-Beta Pruning**: An optimization technique for the minimax algorithm that reduces the number of nodes evaluated in the search tree.\n- **Alpha-Cut and Beta-Cut**: Conditions in Alpha-Beta pruning where branches are pruned based on the alpha and beta values.\n- **SSS* Algorithm**: A game-tree search algorithm that uses a selective search strategy to find optimal moves.\n\n#### 5. Automated Planning\n- **Goal Stack Planning**: A planning algorithm that uses a stack to keep track of subgoals and actions.\n- **Predicates and Operators**: Definitions of predicates (conditions) and operators (actions) in a planning domain.\n- **Optimal Plan**: A sequence of actions that achieves the goal with the least cost.\n\n### Equations\n1. **Sum of Geometric Series**:\n   \\[\n   \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} ar^k = a \\frac{1 - r^n}{1 - r}\n   \\]\n   where \\( a \\) is the first term and \\( r \\) is the common ratio.\n\n2. **A* Algorithm Cost Function**:\n   \\[\n   f(n) = g(n) + h(n)\n   \\]\n   where \\( g(n) \\) is the cost to reach node \\( n \\) and \\( h(n) \\) is the heuristic estimate of the cost from \\( n \\) to the goal.\n\n3. **Weighted A* Algorithm Cost Function**:\n   \\[\n   f(n) = g(n) + w \\cdot h(n)\n   \\]\n   where \\( w \\) is the weight factor.\n\n### Knowledge Graph \n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[Search Algorithms] --> B[Breadth-First Search]\n    A --> C[Best-First Search]\n    A --> D[Branch and Bound]\n    A --> E[A* Algorithm]\n    A --> F[Weighted A* Algorithm]\n    G[Heuristics] --> H[Admissible Heuristic]\n    I[Traveling Salesman Problem] --> J[Branch and Bound for TSP]\n    I --> K[Lower Bound Calculation]\n    L[Game Theory] --> M[Alpha-Beta Pruning]\n    L --> N[Alpha-Cut and Beta-Cut]\n    L --> O[SSS* Algorithm]\n    P[Automated Planning] --> Q[Goal Stack Planning]\n    P --> R[Predicates and Operators]\n    P --> S[Optimal Plan]\n```\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    T[Equations] --> U[Sum of Geometric Series]\n    T --> V[A* Algorithm Cost Function]\n    T --> W[Weighted A* Algorithm Cost Function]\n```\n\nThis summary and knowledge graph should help you focus on the essential topics and concepts for your exam.",
