Search Algorithms\n- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Explores all nodes at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\n- **Best-First Search**: Uses an evaluation function to decide which node to expand next.\n- **Branch and Bound**: An algorithm for finding the shortest path in a graph by keeping track of the cost of the path and abandoning paths that exceed the current best path cost.\n- **A* Algorithm**: Combines the benefits of Dijkstra's algorithm and Greedy Best-First Search by using both the cost to reach the node and the heuristic estimate of the cost to reach the goal.\n- **Weighted A* Algorithm (wA*)**: A variant of A* where the heuristic function is multiplied by a weight factor to control the trade-off between path quality and search time.\n\n#### 2. Heuristics\n- **Admissible Heuristic**: A heuristic that never overestimates the cost to reach the goal.\n- **Heuristic Function**: A function that estimates the cost of the cheapest path from a given node to the goal.\n\n#### 3. Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)\n- **Branch and Bound for TSP**: A method to solve TSP by systematically enumerating all candidate solutions and pruning large parts of the search space.\n- **Lower Bound**: The minimum possible cost of a tour.\n- **Edge Selection**: Choosing the edges with the smallest weights to form a tour.\n\n#### 4. Game Theory\n- **Alpha-Beta Pruning**: A search algorithm that reduces the number of nodes evaluated in the search tree by the minimax algorithm.\n- **Alpha-Cut and Beta-Cut**: Techniques used in Alpha-Beta pruning to eliminate branches in the search tree.\n- **Horizon Nodes**: Nodes at the deepest level of the search tree.\n- **SSS* Algorithm**: A state-space search algorithm that uses a best-first search strategy.\n\n#### 5. Automated Planning\n- **Goal Stack Planning**: An algorithm for automated planning that uses a stack to keep track of goals and subgoals.\n- **Predicates and Operators**: Definitions used in planning problems to describe the state and actions.\n- **Optimal Plan**: A plan that achieves the goal with the minimum number of actions.\n\n### Equations\n- **Geometric Series Sum**: \\( \\text{sum}(1, a, a^2, a^3, \\ldots, a^{n-1}) = \\frac{1 - a^n}{1 - a} \\)\n- **Heuristic Function**: \\( f(n) = g(n) + h(n) \\), where \\( g(n) \\) is the cost to reach node \\( n \\) and \\( h(n) \\) is the heuristic estimate of the cost to reach the goal from node \\( n \\).\n\n### Knowledge Graph \n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[Search Algorithms] --> B[Breadth-First Search]\n    A --> C[Best-First Search]\n    A --> D[Branch and Bound]\n    A --> E[A* Algorithm]\n    A --> F[Weighted A* Algorithm]\n    B --> G[Explores all nodes at present depth]\n    C --> H[Uses evaluation function]\n    D --> I[Keeps track of path cost]\n    E --> J[Combines Dijkstra and Greedy Best-First]\n    F --> K[Multiplies heuristic by weight factor]\n\n    L[Heuristics] --> M[Admissible Heuristic]\n    L --> N[Heuristic Function]\n    M --> O[Never overestimates cost]\n    N --> P[Estimates cost to goal]\n\n    Q[Traveling Salesman Problem] --> R[Branch and Bound for TSP]\n    Q --> S[Lower Bound]\n    Q --> T[Edge Selection]\n    R --> U[Systematic enumeration]\n    S --> V[Minimum possible cost]\n    T --> W[Smallest weights]\n\n    X[Game Theory] --> Y[Alpha-Beta Pruning]\n    X --> Z[Horizon Nodes]\n    X --> AA[SSS* Algorithm]\n    Y --> AB[Reduces nodes evaluated]\n    Z --> AC[Deepest level nodes]\n    AA --> AD[Best-first search strategy]\n\n    AE[Automated Planning] --> AF[Goal Stack Planning]\n    AE --> AG[Predicates and Operators]\n    AE --> AH[Optimal Plan]\n    AF --> AI[Uses stack for goals]\n    AG --> AJ[Describe state and actions]\n    AH --> AK[Minimum actions to goal]\n```\n\n### Additional Knowledge Graph for Specific Concepts\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[Alpha-Beta Pruning] --> B[Alpha-Cut]\n    A --> C[Beta-Cut]\n    B --> D[Prunes MAX nodes]\n    C --> E[Prunes MIN nodes]\n\n    F[Heuristic Function] --> G[Admissible Heuristic]\n    F --> H[Consistent Heuristic]\n    G --> I[Never overestimates cost]\n    H --> J[Satisfies triangle inequality]\n\n    K[Game Tree] --> L[Horizon Nodes]\n    K --> M[Alpha-Beta Pruning]\n    L --> N[Deepest level nodes]\n    M --> O[Reduces search space]\n\n    P[Automated Planning] --> Q[Goal Stack Planning]\n    P --> R[Predicates and Operators]\n    Q --> S[Uses stack for goals]\n    R --> T[Describe state and actions]\n```\n\nThis summary and the knowledge graphs should help you understand the core topics, concepts, principles, and equations essential for the exam.",
