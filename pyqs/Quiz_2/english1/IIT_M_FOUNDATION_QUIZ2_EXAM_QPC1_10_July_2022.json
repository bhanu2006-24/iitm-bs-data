I still do not know who told her that I was skipping lunch before school. Perhaps it was the houseboy, Fide. Perhaps it was my little brother Kenechukwu, who went to school in the morning and came home just before I left. The firm set of her mouth told me that I had no choice but to eat the garri and soup placed on the table. I made the sign of the cross. I plucked a morsel from the soft lump of garri. I lightly moulded it with my fingers. I dipped it into the soup. I swallowed. My throat itched. I disliked all the variants of this quintessential Nigerian food, whether made from corn, cassava, or yams, whether cooked or stirred or pounded in a mortar until they became a soft mash. It was jokingly called \u201cswallow,\u201d because one swallowed the morsels without chewing; it was easy to tell that a person chewing garri was a foreigner.  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cHurry up,\u201d my mother said. \u201cYou will be late for school.\u201d We had\u00a0garri\u00a0for lunch every day except Sunday, when we had rice and stew and sometimes a lush salad that contained everything from baked beans to boiled eggs and was served with dollops of creamy dressing. The soups gave some variety to lunch: the yellowish\u00a0egusi, made of ground melon seeds and vegetables;\u00a0onugbu, rich with dark-green bitterleaf;\u00a0okro, with its sticky sauce;\u00a0nsala, with beef chunks floating in a thin herb-filled broth. I disliked them all.  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 That afternoon, it was\u00a0egusi\u00a0soup. My mother\u2019s eyes were steady behind her glasses. \u201cAre you playing with that food or eating it?\u201d she asked. I said I was eating. Finally, I finished and said, \u201cMummy, thank you,\u201d as all well-brought-up Igbo children were supposed to after a meal. I had just stepped outside the carpeted dining area and onto the polished concrete floor of the passage when my stomach churned and recoiled and the\u00a0garri\u00a0and soup rushed up my throat.  \u2014Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, Real Food",

I still do not know who told her that I was skipping lunch before school. Perhaps it was the houseboy, Fide. Perhaps it was my little brother Kenechukwu, who went to school in the morning and came home just before I left. The firm set of her mouth told me that I had no choice but to eat the garri and soup placed on the table. I made the sign of the cross. I plucked a morsel from the soft lump of garri. I lightly moulded it with my fingers. I dipped it into the soup. I swallowed. My throat itched. I disliked all the variants of this quintessential Nigerian food, whether made from corn, cassava, or yams, whether cooked or stirred or pounded in a mortar until they became a soft mash. It was jokingly called \u201cswallow,\u201d because one swallowed the morsels without chewing; it was easy to tell that a person chewing garri was a foreigner.  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cHurry up,\u201d my mother said. \u201cYou will be late for school.\u201d We had\u00a0garri\u00a0for lunch every day except Sunday, when we had rice and stew and sometimes a lush salad that contained everything from baked beans to boiled eggs and was served with dollops of creamy dressing. The soups gave some variety to lunch: the yellowish\u00a0egusi, made of ground melon seeds and vegetables;\u00a0onugbu, rich with dark-green bitterleaf;\u00a0okro, with its sticky sauce;\u00a0nsala, with beef chunks floating in a thin herb-filled broth. I disliked them all.  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 That afternoon, it was\u00a0egusi\u00a0soup. My mother\u2019s eyes were steady behind her glasses. \u201cAre you playing with that food or eating it?\u201d she asked. I said I was eating. Finally, I finished and said, \u201cMummy, thank you,\u201d as all well-brought-up Igbo children were supposed to after a meal. I had just stepped outside the carpeted dining area and onto the polished concrete floor of the passage when my stomach churned and recoiled and the\u00a0garri\u00a0and soup rushed up my throat.  \u2014Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, Real Food",

I still do not know who told her that I was skipping lunch before school. Perhaps it was the houseboy, Fide. Perhaps it was my little brother Kenechukwu, who went to school in the morning and came home just before I left. The firm set of her mouth told me that I had no choice but to eat the garri and soup placed on the table. I made the sign of the cross. I plucked a morsel from the soft lump of garri. I lightly moulded it with my fingers. I dipped it into the soup. I swallowed. My throat itched. I disliked all the variants of this quintessential Nigerian food, whether made from corn, cassava, or yams, whether cooked or stirred or pounded in a mortar until they became a soft mash. It was jokingly called \u201cswallow,\u201d because one swallowed the morsels without chewing; it was easy to tell that a person chewing garri was a foreigner.  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cHurry up,\u201d my mother said. \u201cYou will be late for school.\u201d We had\u00a0garri\u00a0for lunch every day except Sunday, when we had rice and stew and sometimes a lush salad that contained everything from baked beans to boiled eggs and was served with dollops of creamy dressing. The soups gave some variety to lunch: the yellowish\u00a0egusi, made of ground melon seeds and vegetables;\u00a0onugbu, rich with dark-green bitterleaf;\u00a0okro, with its sticky sauce;\u00a0nsala, with beef chunks floating in a thin herb-filled broth. I disliked them all.  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 That afternoon, it was\u00a0egusi\u00a0soup. My mother\u2019s eyes were steady behind her glasses. \u201cAre you playing with that food or eating it?\u201d she asked. I said I was eating. Finally, I finished and said, \u201cMummy, thank you,\u201d as all well-brought-up Igbo children were supposed to after a meal.

                            "Read the following passage and answer the given subquestions:  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 I was nine years old, sitting stiffly at the dining table in my blue-and-white school uniform, and across from me sat my mother, who had come home from work at the university registry, elegant in her swishy skirt, smelling of Poison perfume and saying she wanted to watch me eat. I still do not know who told her that I was skipping lunch before school. Perhaps it was the houseboy, Fide. Perhaps it was my little brother Kenechukwu, who went to school in the morning and came home just before I left. The firm set of her mouth told me that I had no choice but to eat the garri and soup placed on the table. I made the sign of the cross. I plucked a morsel from the soft lump of garri. I lightly moulded it with my fingers. I dipped it into the soup. I swallowed. My throat itched. I disliked all the variants of this quintessential Nigerian food, whether made from corn, cassava, or yams, whether cooked or stirred or pounded in a mortar until they became a soft mash. It was jokingly called \u201cswallow,\u201d because one swallowed the morsels without chewing; it was easy to tell that a person chewing garri was a foreigner.  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cHurry up,\u201d my mother said. \u201cYou will be late for school.\u201d We had\u00a0garri\u00a0for lunch every day except Sunday, when we had rice and stew and sometimes a lush salad that contained everything from baked beans to boiled eggs and was served with dollops of creamy dressing. The soups gave some variety to lunch: the yellowish\u00a0egusi, made of ground melon seeds and vegetables;\u00a0onugbu, rich with dark-green bitterleaf;\u00a0okro, with its sticky sauce;\u00a0nsala, with beef chunks floating in a thin herb-filled broth. I disliked them all.  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 That afternoon, it was\u00a0egusi\u00a0soup. My mother\u2019s eyes were steady behind her glasses. \u201cAre you playing with that food or eating it?\u201d she asked. I said I was eating. Finally, I finished and said, \u201cMummy, thank you,\u201d as all well-brought-up Igbo children were supposed to after a meal. I had just stepped outside the carpeted dining area and onto the polished concrete floor of the passage when my stomach churned and recoiled and the\u00a0garri\u00a0and soup rushed up my throat.  \u2014Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, Real Food"

I still do not know who told her that I was skipping lunch before school. Perhaps it was the houseboy, Fide. Perhaps it was my little brother Kenechukwu, who went to school in the morning and came home just before I left. The firm set of her mouth told me that I had no choice but to eat the garri and soup placed on the table. I made the sign of the cross. I plucked a morsel from the soft lump of garri. I lightly moulded it with my fingers. I dipped it into the soup. I swallowed. My throat itched. I disliked all the variants of this quintessential Nigerian food, whether made from corn, cassava, or yams, whether cooked or stirred or pounded in a mortar until they became a soft mash. It was jokingly called \u201cswallow,\u201d because one swallowed the morsels without chewing; it was easy to tell that a person chewing garri was a foreigner.  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cHurry up,\u201d my mother said. \u201cYou will be late for school.\u201d We had\u00a0garri\u00a0for lunch every day except Sunday, when we had rice and stew and sometimes a lush salad that contained everything from baked beans to boiled eggs and was served with dollops of creamy dressing. The soups gave some variety to lunch: the yellowish\u00a0egusi, made of ground melon seeds and vegetables;\u00a0onugbu, rich with dark-green bitterleaf;\u00a0okro, with its sticky sauce;\u00a0nsala, with beef chunks floating in a thin herb-filled broth. I disliked them all.  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 That afternoon, it was\u00a0egusi\u00a0soup. My mother\u2019s eyes were steady behind her glasses. \u201cAre you playing with that food or eating it?\u201d she asked. I said I was eating. Finally, I finished and said, \u201cMummy, thank you,\u201d as all well-brought-up Igbo children were supposed to after a meal. I had just stepped outside the carpeted dining area and onto the polished concrete floor of the passage when my stomach churned and recoiled and the\u00a0garri\u00a0and soup rushed up my throat.  \u2014Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, Real Food",

I still do not know who told her that I was skipping lunch before school. Perhaps it was the houseboy, Fide. Perhaps it was my little brother Kenechukwu, who went to school in the morning and came home just before I left. The firm set of her mouth told me that I had no choice but to eat the garri and soup placed on the table. I made the sign of the cross. I plucked a morsel from the soft lump of garri. I lightly moulded it with my fingers. I dipped it into the soup. I swallowed. My throat itched. I disliked all the variants of this quintessential Nigerian food, whether made from corn, cassava, or yams, whether cooked or stirred or pounded in a mortar until they became a soft mash. It was jokingly called \u201cswallow,\u201d because one swallowed the morsels without chewing; it was easy to tell that a person chewing garri was a foreigner.  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cHurry up,\u201d my mother said. \u201cYou will be late for school.\u201d We had\u00a0garri\u00a0for lunch every day except Sunday, when we had rice and stew and sometimes a lush salad that contained everything from baked beans to boiled eggs and was served with dollops of creamy dressing. The soups gave some variety to lunch: the yellowish\u00a0egusi, made of ground melon seeds and vegetables;\u00a0onugbu, rich with dark-green bitterleaf;\u00a0okro, with its sticky sauce;\u00a0nsala, with beef chunks floating in a thin herb-filled broth. I disliked them all.  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 That afternoon, it was\u00a0egusi\u00a0soup. My mother\u2019s eyes were steady behind her glasses. \u201cAre you playing with that food or eating it?\u201d she asked. I said I was eating. Finally, I finished and said, \u201cMummy, thank you,\u201d as all well-brought-up Igbo children were supposed to after a meal. I had just stepped outside the carpeted dining area and onto the polished concrete floor of the passage when my stomach churned and recoiled and the\u00a0garri\u00a0and soup rushed up my throat.  \u2014Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, Real Food",

I still do not know who told her that I was skipping lunch before school. Perhaps it was the houseboy, Fide. Perhaps it was my little brother Kenechukwu, who went to school in the morning and came home just before I left. The firm set of her mouth told me that I had no choice but to eat the garri and soup placed on the table. I made the sign of the cross. I plucked a morsel from the soft lump of garri. I lightly moulded it with my fingers. I dipped it into the soup. I swallowed. My throat itched. I disliked all the variants of this quintessential Nigerian food, whether made from corn, cassava, or yams, whether cooked or stirred or pounded in a mortar until they became a soft mash. It was jokingly called \u201cswallow,\u201d because one swallowed the morsels without chewing; it was easy to tell that a person chewing garri was a foreigner.  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cHurry up,\u201d my mother said. \u201cYou will be late for school.\u201d We had\u00a0garri\u00a0for lunch every day except Sunday, when we had rice and stew and sometimes a lush salad that contained everything from baked beans to boiled eggs and was served with dollops of creamy dressing. The soups gave some variety to lunch: the yellowish\u00a0egusi, made of ground melon seeds and vegetables;\u00a0onugbu, rich with dark-green bitterleaf;\u00a0okro, with its sticky sauce;\u00a0nsala, with beef chunks floating in a thin herb-filled broth. I disliked them all.  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 That afternoon, it was\u00a0egusi\u00a0soup. My mother\u2019s eyes were steady behind her glasses. \u201cAre you playing with that food or eating it?\u201d she asked. I said I was eating. Finally, I finished and said, \u201cMummy, thank you,\u201d as all well-brought-up Igbo children were supposed to after a meal. I had just stepped outside the carpeted dining area and onto the polished concrete floor of the passage when my stomach churned and recoiled and the\u00a0garri\u00a0and soup rushed up my throat.  \u2014Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, Real Food"
