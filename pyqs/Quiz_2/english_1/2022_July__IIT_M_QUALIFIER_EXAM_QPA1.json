Advise procedure.\u201d They sent a man running to send off this telegram to their headquarters.  It was a top-priority government telegram, and it fetched a reply within an hour: \u201cImperative that Swami should be saved. Persuade best to cooperate. Should not risk life. Try give glucose and saline. Persuade Swami resume fast later.\u201d  They sat beside the Swami and read the message to him. He smiled at it. He beckoned Velan to come nearer.  The doctors appealed, \u201cTell him he should save himself. Please, do your best. He is very weak.\u201c Velan bent close to the Swami and said, \u201cThe doctors say\u2014\u201d  In answer Raju asked the man to bend nearer, and whispered, \u201cHelp me to my feet,\u201c and clung to his arm and lifted himself. He got up to his feet. He had to be held by Velan and another on each side. In the profoundest silence the crowd followed him down. Everyone followed at a solemn, silent pace. The eastern sky was red. Many in the camp were still sleeping. Raju could not walk, but he insisted upon pulling himself along all the same. He panted with the effort. He went down the steps of the river, halting for breath on each step, and finally reached his basin of water. He stepped into it, shut his eyes, and turned toward the mountain, his lips muttering the prayer. Velan and another held him each by an arm. The morning sun was out by now; a great shaft of light illuminated the surroundings. It was difficult to hold Raju on his feet, as he had a tendency to flop down. They held him as if he were a baby. Raju opened his eyes, looked about, and said, \u201cVelan, it's raining in the hills. I can feel it coming up under my feet, up my legs\u2014\u201d He sagged down. \u2013 The Guide, R K Narayan",

Try give glucose and saline. Persuade Swami resume fast later.\u201d  They sat beside the Swami and read the message to him. He smiled at it. He beckoned Velan to come nearer.  The doctors appealed, \u201cTell him he should save himself. Please, do your best. He is very weak.\u201c Velan bent close to the Swami and said, \u201cThe doctors say\u2014\u201d  In answer Raju asked the man to bend nearer, and whispered, \u201cHelp me to my feet,\u201c and clung to his arm and lifted himself. He got up to his feet. He had to be held by Velan and another on each side. In the profoundest silence the crowd followed him down. Everyone followed at a solemn, silent pace. The eastern sky was red. Many in the camp were still sleeping. Raju could not walk, but he insisted upon pulling himself along all the same. He panted with the effort. He went down the steps of the river, halting for breath on each step, and finally reached his basin of water. He stepped into it, shut his eyes, and turned toward the mountain, his lips muttering the prayer. Velan and another held him each by an arm. The morning sun was out by now; a great shaft of light illuminated the surroundings. It was difficult to hold Raju on his feet, as he had a tendency to flop down. They held him as if he were a baby. Raju opened his eyes, looked about, and said, \u201cVelan, it's raining in the hills. I can feel it coming up under my feet, up my legs\u2014\u201d He sagged down. \u2013 The Guide, R K Narayan",
