Since graduation, I\u2019ve been working as a fellow at ThinkAsia, a human rights organisation based out of Singapore. I\u2019ve been looking to get involved in international law for a long-term role after my fellowship is done in four months, which is why I am looking to find work in a legal firm such as yours.  Boss: Great. We are a legal firm \u2014quite different from the NGOs and human rights organisations you have worked with. Then why our firm? What about our firm interests you?  Shrinidhi: I\u2019m interested in the legal work you do for conflict-ridden areas in the Asia-Pacific, especially South Asia. Although I have a human rights background, I want to gain a firm grounding in the legal aspects of human rights, which I hope to do at your organisation.

Well, let\u2019s get started then. Would you like to tell me about yourself?  Shrinidhi: Sure. I graduated last year with a Bachelor\u2019s degree in International Relations from Wellesley College, where I took to the specific field of human rights and international law quite quickly, and then pursued a research internship at the International Justice Organisation.  Since graduation, I\u2019ve been working as a fellow at ThinkAsia, a human rights organisation based out of Singapore. I\u2019ve been looking to get involved in international law for a long-term role after my fellowship is done in four months, which is why I am looking to find work in a legal firm such as yours.  Boss: Great. We are a legal firm \u2014quite different from the NGOs and human rights organisations you have worked with. Then why our firm? What about our firm interests you?  Shrinidhi: I\u2019m interested in the legal work you do for conflict-ridden areas in the Asia-Pacific, especially South Asia. Although I have a human rights background, I want to gain a firm grounding in the legal aspects of human rights, which I hope to do at your organisation.

Shrinidhi: I\u2019m interested in the legal work you do for conflict-ridden areas in the Asia-Pacific, especially South Asia.
