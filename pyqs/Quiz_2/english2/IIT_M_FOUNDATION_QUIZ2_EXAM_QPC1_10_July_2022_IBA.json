If you\u2019re free, you can meet us at the east gate at seven.   Isha: I\u2019d love to Mahesh, but I have tuition classes tonight.  Mahesh: Tuition? I can\u2019t imagine you needing help with a class.  Isha: The tuition I\u2019m talking about is tutoring I\u2019m doing for someone else\u2014though, now that you mention it, physics has been giving me more problems than usual this semester.  Mahesh: I find that hard to believe. Uh, so are you tutoring one of the juniors, or something?  Isha: Actually, no, I go out of campus to tutor a few students at the Perambur Government High School.  Mahesh: High school kids? Wow. In maths or something?  Isha: Right. You\u2019ve probably read about this in the paper, but the city\u2019s trying to raise the standards for its maths classes. The problem is, a lot of the kids are behind when they get to junior college.  Mahesh: So you help them catch up?  Isha: Basically. I have three students for forty-five minutes each on Wednesday night. So I\u2019m there from 6:00 to 8:30 or so.  Mahesh: Isn\u2019t that late for kids to be still at school?  Isha: Well, they\u2019d be doing homework at that hour if they were home, anyway. The thing is, most of the tutors are students here at the university, so our classes aren\u2019t over until late afternoon. And the education department likes us. We\u2019re good at what we do, but we volunteer, so the program doesn\u2019t cost a lot beyond, you know, the electricity to keep the high school open at night.  Mahesh: Can you afford to take that much time away from your own studying?  Isha: Some weeks it\u2019s kind of hard, but, I mean, when I start my PhD, I\u2019m going to have to start teaching physics to students as a professor\u2019s assistant, anyway. I may as well get used to teaching with easier material and just one student at a time.  Mahesh: And it must be nice to help people.  Isha: Definitely. That goes without saying. Forty-five minutes a week isn\u2019t much time, but all three of my students have improved in the months we\u2019ve worked together. It\u2019s really inspiring.  Mahesh: Cool.  Isha: So, anyway, sorry about dinner. It sounds like fun, and if it were any other night\u2014  Mahesh: Hey, I understand. Have fun, and I guess I\u2019ll see you in class tomorrow morning.",

If you\u2019re free, you can meet us at the east gate at seven.   Isha: I\u2019d love to Mahesh, but I have tuition classes tonight.  Mahesh: Tuition? I can\u2019t imagine you needing help with a class.  Isha: The tuition I\u2019m talking about is tutoring I\u2019m doing for someone else\u2014though, now that you mention it, physics has been giving me more problems than usual this semester.  Mahesh: I find that hard to believe. Uh, so are you tutoring one of the juniors, or something?  Isha: Actually, no, I go out of campus to tutor a few students at the Perambur Government High School.  Mahesh: High school kids? Wow. In maths or something?  Isha: Right. You\u2019ve probably read about this in the paper, but the city\u2019s trying to raise the standards for its maths classes. The problem is, a lot of the kids are behind when they get to junior college.  Mahesh: So you help them catch up?  Isha: Basically. I have three students for forty-five minutes each on Wednesday night. So I\u2019m there from 6:00 to 8:30 or so.  Mahesh: Isn\u2019t that late for kids to be still at school?  Isha: Well, they\u2019d be doing homework at that hour if they were home, anyway. The thing is, most of the tutors are students here at the university, so our classes aren\u2019t over until late afternoon. And the education department likes us. We\u2019re good at what we do, but we volunteer, so the program doesn\u2019t cost a lot beyond, you know, the electricity to keep the high school open at night.  Mahesh: Can you afford to take that much time away from your own studying?  Isha: Some weeks it\u2019s kind of hard, but, I mean, when I start my PhD, I\u2019m going to have to start teaching physics to students as a professor\u2019s assistant, anyway. I may as well get used to teaching with easier material and just one student at a time.  Mahesh: And it must be nice to help people.  Isha: Definitely. That goes without saying. Forty-five minutes a week isn\u2019t much time, but all three of my students have improved in the months we\u2019ve worked together. It\u2019s really inspiring.  Mahesh: Cool.  Isha: So, anyway, sorry about dinner. It sounds like fun, and if it were any other night\u2014  Mahesh: Hey, I understand. Have fun, and I guess I\u2019ll see you in class tomorrow morning.",

If you\u2019re free, you can meet us at the east gate at seven.   Isha: I\u2019d love to Mahesh, but I have tuition classes tonight.  Mahesh: Tuition? I can\u2019t imagine you needing help with a class.  Isha: The tuition I\u2019m talking about is tutoring I\u2019m doing for someone else\u2014though, now that you mention it, physics has been giving me more problems than usual this semester.  Mahesh: I find that hard to believe. Uh, so are you tutoring one of the juniors, or something?  Isha: Actually, no, I go out of campus to tutor a few students at the Perambur Government High School.  Mahesh: High school kids? Wow. In maths or something?  Isha: Right. You\u2019ve probably read about this in the paper, but the city\u2019s trying to raise the standards for its maths classes. The problem is, a lot of the kids are behind when they get to junior college.  Mahesh: So you help them catch up?  Isha: Basically. I have three students for forty-five minutes each on Wednesday night. So I\u2019m there from 6:00 to 8:30 or so.  Mahesh: Isn\u2019t that late for kids to be still at school?  Isha: Well, they\u2019d be doing homework at that hour if they were home, anyway. The thing is, most of the tutors are students here at the university, so our classes aren\u2019t over until late afternoon. And the education department likes us. We\u2019re good at what we do, but we volunteer, so the program doesn\u2019t cost a lot beyond, you know, the electricity to keep the high school open at night.  Mahesh: Can you afford to take that much time away from your own studying?  Isha: Some weeks it\u2019s kind of hard, but, I mean, when I start my PhD, I\u2019m going to have to start teaching physics to students as a professor\u2019s assistant, anyway. I may as well get used to teaching with easier material and just one student at a time.  Mahesh: And it must be nice to help people.  Isha: Definitely. That goes without saying. Forty-five minutes a week isn\u2019t much time, but all three of my students have improved in the months we\u2019ve worked together. It\u2019s really inspiring.  Mahesh: Cool.  Isha: So, anyway, sorry about dinner. It sounds like fun, and if it were any other night\u2014  Mahesh: Hey, I understand. Have fun, and I guess I\u2019ll see you in class tomorrow morning."
