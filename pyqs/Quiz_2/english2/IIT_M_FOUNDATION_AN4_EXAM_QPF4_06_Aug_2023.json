Abeer: Well, I'm interested in the internship at the university art museum\u2026 what responsibilities interns have, what qualifications they need to have... Prof. Sriram: Sorry, those positions are all filled for this year... Abeer: Oh! But I just saw the announcement on the museum website this morning. Prof. Sriram: Unfortunately, the website is out of date. Abeer: I want to do museum work after I graduate, and the job experience would look great on my r\u00e9sum\u00e9. Plus it's the only paid internship on campus. Prof. Sriram: I understand. However, there are some other ways to get some work experience, even if it's not exactly what you want. For instance, the library is looking for student volunteers. Abeer: The library? But... Prof. Sriram: Well, they're planning an exhibition of photographs documenting the history of the university. And they're looking for student volunteers to help go through the archives and select images that'll show how the university's changed over the last hundred years. Abeer: Hmm... Prof. Sriram: Now that's only a four-week project, I think. And, of course, it's unpaid. Abeer: But it would be something to put on my r\u00e9sum\u00e9... Prof. Sriram: Exactly. Why don't you read the job description\u2014it's posted on the library's website. If you're interested, let me know, and I'll put in a good word for you with Geeta Raj. She's the library's exhibitions director and will be interviewing applicants. Abeer: OK, I'll do that right away.",

Abeer: Well, I'm interested in the internship at the university art museum\u2026 what responsibilities interns have, what qualifications they need to have... Prof. Sriram: Sorry, those positions are all filled for this year... Abeer: Oh! But I just saw the announcement on the museum website this morning. Prof. Sriram: Unfortunately, the website is out of date. Abeer: I want to do museum work after I graduate, and the job experience would look great on my r\u00e9sum\u00e9. Plus it's the only paid internship on campus. Prof. Sriram: I understand. However, there are some other ways to get some work experience, even if it's not exactly what you want. For instance, the library is looking for student volunteers. Abeer: The library? But... Prof. Sriram: Well, they're planning an exhibition of photographs documenting the history of the university. And they're looking for student volunteers to help go through the archives and select images that'll show how the university's changed over the last hundred years. Abeer: Hmm... Prof. Sriram: Now that's only a four-week project, I think. And, of course, it's unpaid. Abeer: But it would be something to put on my r\u00e9sum\u00e9... Prof. Sriram: Exactly. Why don't you read the job description\u2014it's posted on the library's website. If you're interested, let me know, and I'll put in a good word for you with Geeta Raj.

For instance, the library is looking for student volunteers. Abeer: The library? But... Prof. Sriram: Well, they're planning an exhibition of photographs documenting the history of the university. And they're looking for student volunteers to help go through the archives and select images that'll show how the university's changed over the last hundred years. Abeer: Hmm... Prof. Sriram: Now that's only a four-week project, I think. And, of course, it's unpaid. Abeer: But it would be something to put on my r\u00e9sum\u00e9... Prof. Sriram: Exactly.

Abeer: Well, I'm interested in the internship at the university art museum\u2026 what responsibilities interns have, what qualifications they need to have... Prof. Sriram: Sorry, those positions are all filled for this year... Abeer: Oh! But I just saw the announcement on the museum website this morning. Prof. Sriram: Unfortunately, the website is out of date. Abeer: I want to do museum work after I graduate, and the job experience would look great on my r\u00e9sum\u00e9. Plus it's the only paid internship on campus. Prof. Sriram: I understand. However, there are some other ways to get some work experience, even if it's not exactly what you want. For instance, the library is looking for student volunteers. Abeer: The library? But... Prof. Sriram: Well, they're planning an exhibition of photographs documenting the history of the university. And they're looking for student volunteers to help go through the archives and select images that'll show how the university's changed over the last hundred years. Abeer: Hmm... Prof. Sriram: Now that's only a four-week project, I think. And, of course, it's unpaid. Abeer: But it would be something to put on my r\u00e9sum\u00e9... Prof. Sriram: Exactly. Why don't you read the job description\u2014it's posted on the library's website. If you're interested, let me know, and I'll put in a good word for you with Geeta Raj. She's the library's exhibitions director and will be interviewing applicants. Abeer: OK, I'll do that right away.",
