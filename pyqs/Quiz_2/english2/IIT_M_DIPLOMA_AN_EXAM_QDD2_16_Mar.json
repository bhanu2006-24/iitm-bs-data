Opened to the public in January, it has reduced the distance between Sewri on the island city and Chirle near the Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust (JNPT) in Raigad district [1] _____ \u2013 from 60 km to 22 km. \u201cThe best thing about the MTHL is the non-stop 22 km journey on the sea bridge,\u201d said Saji S., who commutes 60 km one way from his house in Ambernath to Mumbai every day. For a long time, two bridges over Thane creek linked Mumbai to Navi Mumbai\u2013 the Mulund-Airoli connector and the Vashi connector. The MTHL is the third. \u201cThis bridge is on land, sea and mudflats in between the two,\u201d said Dr. Sanjay Mukherjee, metropolitan commissioner, Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority. \u201cThe seismic strength of the bridge is [2] _____ the normal seismic activity of that region.\u201d The bridge is a six-lane highway that ensures quick connectivity from the city to JNPT, the under-construction Navi Mumbai airport, the expressway to Pune and the national highway to Goa. Shinde said the MTHL was a game changer for commuters and the economy. \u201cWe are connecting the MTHL to the Worli sea link and to Nariman Point via the coastal road,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople living in Nariman Point will now be able to reach Panvel in [3] _____ minutes.\u201d It currently takes more than an hour. The MTHL has given the city the opportunity to grow horizontally. It will be the engine of economic growth for Mumbai and the Mumbai Metropolitan region, said S. V. R. Srinivas, former managing director of MMRDA, who oversaw most of the work on the MTHL during his tenure. Officially the Atal Setu, the MTHL is also a bridge to Mumbai\u2019s future. \u201cAtal Setu will facilitate the creation of \u2018Third Mumbai\u2019 in the Navi Mumbai-Raigad region,\u201d said Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar. The government has facilitated MMRDA as the New Town Development Authority (NTDA) to focus on the growth of the areas that will be benefitted by the Atal Setu. Third Mumbai is an ambitious smart city that is envisaged in the area close to the upcoming Navi Mumbai International Airport. The project encompasses 124 villages in the Raigad district. Several villages from the existing Navi Mumbai Airport Influence Notified Area are also likely to be a part of the NTDA. The NTDA is expected to oversee [4] _____ area in the Panvel-Ulwe-Uran region where the new airport and the MTHL will offer connectivity. It will feature housing projects, commercial complexes, data centres, IT knowledge parks and financial service hubs. The foundation stone for the airport was laid in 2018. The Rs.18,000 crore project, planned on 1,160 [5] _____, is the largest greenfield airport under development. Just as the MTHL is easing the commute from South Mumbai to Navi Mumbai and beyond, Mumbai Metro has now become a practical alternative to the overcrowded suburban trains for lakhs of Mumbaikaars. The lifeline of commuters, the local trains have been running [6] _____ owing to the multi-fold increase in the number of travellers over the years, especially during peak hours. People in the suburbs are quickly switching to the clean, air-conditioned metro trains to travel to the city. \u201cMetro saves a lot of time,\u201d says Sayali M., a regular commuter from Gundavali to Aarey. \u201cIf I take an autorickshaw on this route, it takes [7] _____ 50 minutes and costs around Rs.150. I cover the same distance by metro in 15 minutes and it costs [8] _____.\u201d Mumbai Metro\u2019s Line 3, which connects the northern suburbs at Aarey to Colaba, the city\u2019s southernmost area, is probably the most crucial infrastructure project in the city. This Rs.30,000 crore, 33.5 km line, which is under construction, will have 26 underground stations and will provide connectivity to major business centres like Nariman Point, Cuffe Parade, Fort and Lower Parel, the business district of Bandra Kurla Complex, and the industrial belt of SEEPZ/MIDC (Santacruz Electronics Export Processing Zone/Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation). A fully operational Line 3 would cater to [9] _____, said Ashwini Bhide, managing director of Mumbai Metro Rail Corporation. \u201cAround 35 percent [of road traffic] is expected to reduce. By 2031, [10] _____ will be expected to reduce every day, which will cut the fuel consumption to the tune of 2.95 lakh litres a day.

Opened to the public in January, it has reduced the distance between Sewri on the island city and Chirle near the Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust (JNPT) in Raigad district [1] _____ \u2013 from 60 km to 22 km. \u201cThe best thing about the MTHL is the non-stop 22 km journey on the sea bridge,\u201d said Saji S., who commutes 60 km one way from his house in Ambernath to Mumbai every day. For a long time, two bridges over Thane creek linked Mumbai to Navi Mumbai\u2013 the Mulund-Airoli connector and the Vashi connector. The MTHL is the third. \u201cThis bridge is on land, sea and mudflats in between the two,\u201d said Dr. Sanjay Mukherjee, metropolitan commissioner, Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority. \u201cThe seismic strength of the bridge is [2] _____ the normal seismic activity of that region.\u201d The bridge is a six-lane highway that ensures quick connectivity from the city to JNPT, the under-construction Navi Mumbai airport, the expressway to Pune and the national highway to Goa. Shinde said the MTHL was a game changer for commuters and the economy. \u201cWe are connecting the MTHL to the Worli sea link and to Nariman Point via the coastal road,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople living in Nariman Point will now be able to reach Panvel in [3] _____ minutes.\u201d It currently takes more than an hour. The MTHL has given the city the opportunity to grow horizontally. It will be the engine of economic growth for Mumbai and the Mumbai Metropolitan region, said S. V. R. Srinivas, former managing director of MMRDA, who oversaw most of the work on the MTHL during his tenure. Officially the Atal Setu, the MTHL is also a bridge to Mumbai\u2019s future. \u201cAtal Setu will facilitate the creation of \u2018Third Mumbai\u2019 in the Navi Mumbai-Raigad region,\u201d said Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar. The government has facilitated MMRDA as the New Town Development Authority (NTDA) to focus on the growth of the areas that will be benefitted by the Atal Setu. Third Mumbai is an ambitious smart city that is envisaged in the area close to the upcoming Navi Mumbai International Airport. The project encompasses 124 villages in the Raigad district. Several villages from the existing Navi Mumbai Airport Influence Notified Area are also likely to be a part of the NTDA. The NTDA is expected to oversee [4] _____ area in the Panvel-Ulwe-Uran region where the new airport and the MTHL will offer connectivity. It will feature housing projects, commercial complexes, data centres, IT knowledge parks and financial service hubs. The foundation stone for the airport was laid in 2018. The Rs.18,000 crore project, planned on 1,160 [5] _____, is the largest greenfield airport under development. Just as the MTHL is easing the commute from South Mumbai to Navi Mumbai and beyond, Mumbai Metro has now become a practical alternative to the overcrowded suburban trains for lakhs of Mumbaikaars.

                            "Read the following and answer the given subquestions:\n\nThe MTHL and Mumbai\u2019s Changing Face \nThe longest sea bridge in India, the MTHL was commissioned when Fadnavis was chief minister; construction began in 2016. Opened to the public in January, it has reduced the distance between Sewri on the island city and Chirle near the Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust (JNPT) in Raigad district [1] _____ \u2013 from 60 km to 22 km. \u201cThe best thing about the MTHL is the non-stop 22 km journey on the sea bridge,\u201d said Saji S., who commutes 60 km one way from his house in Ambernath to Mumbai every day. For a long time, two bridges over Thane creek linked Mumbai to Navi Mumbai\u2013 the Mulund-Airoli connector and the Vashi connector. The MTHL is the third. \u201cThis bridge is on land, sea and mudflats in between the two,\u201d said Dr. Sanjay Mukherjee, metropolitan commissioner, Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority. \u201cThe seismic strength of the bridge is [2] _____ the normal seismic activity of that region.\u201d The bridge is a six-lane highway that ensures quick connectivity from the city to JNPT, the under-construction Navi Mumbai airport, the expressway to Pune and the national highway to Goa. Shinde said the MTHL was a game changer for commuters and the economy. \u201cWe are connecting the MTHL to the Worli sea link and to Nariman Point via the coastal road,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople living in Nariman Point will now be able to reach Panvel in [3] _____ minutes.\u201d It currently takes more than an hour. The MTHL has given the city the opportunity to grow horizontally. It will be the engine of economic growth for Mumbai and the Mumbai Metropolitan region, said S. V. R. Srinivas, former managing director of MMRDA, who oversaw most of the work on the MTHL during his tenure. Officially the Atal Setu, the MTHL is also a bridge to Mumbai\u2019s future. \u201cAtal Setu will facilitate the creation of \u2018Third Mumbai\u2019 in the Navi Mumbai-Raigad region,\u201d said Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar. The government has facilitated MMRDA as the New Town Development Authority (NTDA) to focus on the growth of the areas that will be benefitted by the Atal Setu. Third Mumbai is an ambitious smart city that is envisaged in the area close to the upcoming Navi Mumbai International Airport. The project encompasses 124 villages in the Raigad district. Several villages from the existing Navi Mumbai Airport Influence Notified Area are also likely to be a part of the NTDA. The NTDA is expected to oversee [4] _____ area in the Panvel-Ulwe-Uran region where the new airport and the MTHL will offer connectivity. It will feature housing projects, commercial complexes, data centres, IT knowledge parks and financial service hubs. The foundation stone for the airport was laid in 2018. The Rs.18,000 crore project, planned on 1,160 [5] _____, is the largest greenfield airport under development. Just as the MTHL is easing the commute from South Mumbai to Navi Mumbai and beyond, Mumbai Metro has now become a practical alternative to the overcrowded suburban trains for lakhs of Mumbaikaars. The lifeline of commuters, the local trains have been running [6] _____ owing to the multi-fold increase in the number of travellers over the years, especially during peak hours.

Opened to the public in January, it has reduced the distance between Sewri on the island city and Chirle near the Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust (JNPT) in Raigad district [1] _____ \u2013 from 60 km to 22 km. \u201cThe best thing about the MTHL is the non-stop 22 km journey on the sea bridge,\u201d said Saji S., who commutes 60 km one way from his house in Ambernath to Mumbai every day. For a long time, two bridges over Thane creek linked Mumbai to Navi Mumbai\u2013 the Mulund-Airoli connector and the Vashi connector. The MTHL is the third. \u201cThis bridge is on land, sea and mudflats in between the two,\u201d said Dr. Sanjay Mukherjee, metropolitan commissioner, Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority. \u201cThe seismic strength of the bridge is [2] _____ the normal seismic activity of that region.\u201d The bridge is a six-lane highway that ensures quick connectivity from the city to JNPT, the under-construction Navi Mumbai airport, the expressway to Pune and the national highway to Goa. Shinde said the MTHL was a game changer for commuters and the economy. \u201cWe are connecting the MTHL to the Worli sea link and to Nariman Point via the coastal road,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople living in Nariman Point will now be able to reach Panvel in [3] _____ minutes.\u201d It currently takes more than an hour. The MTHL has given the city the opportunity to grow horizontally. It will be the engine of economic growth for Mumbai and the Mumbai Metropolitan region, said S. V. R. Srinivas, former managing director of MMRDA, who oversaw most of the work on the MTHL during his tenure. Officially the Atal Setu, the MTHL is also a bridge to Mumbai\u2019s future. \u201cAtal Setu will facilitate the creation of \u2018Third Mumbai\u2019 in the Navi Mumbai-Raigad region,\u201d said Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar. The government has facilitated MMRDA as the New Town Development Authority (NTDA) to focus on the growth of the areas that will be benefitted by the Atal Setu. Third Mumbai is an ambitious smart city that is envisaged in the area close to the upcoming Navi Mumbai International Airport. The project encompasses 124 villages in the Raigad district. Several villages from the existing Navi Mumbai Airport Influence Notified Area are also likely to be a part of the NTDA. The NTDA is expected to oversee [4] _____ area in the Panvel-Ulwe-Uran region where the new airport and the MTHL will offer connectivity. It will feature housing projects, commercial complexes, data centres, IT knowledge parks and financial service hubs. The foundation stone for the airport was laid in 2018. The Rs.18,000 crore project, planned on 1,160 [5] _____, is the largest greenfield airport under development. Just as the MTHL is easing the commute from South Mumbai to Navi Mumbai and beyond, Mumbai Metro has now become a practical alternative to the overcrowded suburban trains for lakhs of Mumbaikaars. The lifeline of commuters, the local trains have been running [6] _____ owing to the multi-fold increase in the number of travellers over the years, especially during peak hours. People in the suburbs are quickly switching to the clean, air-conditioned metro trains to travel to the city. \u201cMetro saves a lot of time,\u201d says Sayali M., a regular commuter from Gundavali to Aarey. \u201cIf I take an autorickshaw on this route, it takes [7] _____ 50 minutes and costs around Rs.150. I cover the same distance by metro in 15 minutes and it costs [8] _____.\u201d Mumbai Metro\u2019s Line 3, which connects the northern suburbs at Aarey to Colaba, the city\u2019s southernmost area, is probably the most crucial infrastructure project in the city. This Rs.30,000 crore, 33.5 km line, which is under construction, will have 26 underground stations and will provide connectivity to major business centres like Nariman Point, Cuffe Parade, Fort and Lower Parel, the business district of Bandra Kurla Complex, and the industrial belt of SEEPZ/MIDC (Santacruz Electronics Export Processing Zone/Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation). A fully operational Line 3 would cater to [9] _____, said Ashwini Bhide, managing director of Mumbai Metro Rail Corporation. \u201cAround 35 percent [of road traffic] is expected to reduce. By 2031, [10] _____ will be expected to reduce every day, which will cut the fuel consumption to the tune of 2.95 lakh litres a day. Around 15 percent burden on suburban railways will also be lessened,\u201d she said. \nExcerpted from: Jathar, Dnyanesh, and Nachiket Kelkar. \u201cMetropolis in Motion.\u201d The Week, 03 Mar 2024, Mumbai, p. 28-37.",

Opened to the public in January, it has reduced the distance between Sewri on the island city and Chirle near the Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust (JNPT) in Raigad district [1] _____ \u2013 from 60 km to 22 km. \u201cThe best thing about the MTHL is the non-stop 22 km journey on the sea bridge,\u201d said Saji S., who commutes 60 km one way from his house in Ambernath to Mumbai every day. For a long time, two bridges over Thane creek linked Mumbai to Navi Mumbai\u2013 the Mulund-Airoli connector and the Vashi connector. The MTHL is the third. \u201cThis bridge is on land, sea and mudflats in between the two,\u201d said Dr. Sanjay Mukherjee, metropolitan commissioner, Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority. \u201cThe seismic strength of the bridge is [2] _____ the normal seismic activity of that region.\u201d The bridge is a six-lane highway that ensures quick connectivity from the city to JNPT, the under-construction Navi Mumbai airport, the expressway to Pune and the national highway to Goa. Shinde said the MTHL was a game changer for commuters and the economy. \u201cWe are connecting the MTHL to the Worli sea link and to Nariman Point via the coastal road,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople living in Nariman Point will now be able to reach Panvel in [3] _____ minutes.\u201d It currently takes more than an hour. The MTHL has given the city the opportunity to grow horizontally. It will be the engine of economic growth for Mumbai and the Mumbai Metropolitan region, said S. V. R. Srinivas, former managing director of MMRDA, who oversaw most of the work on the MTHL during his tenure. Officially the Atal Setu, the MTHL is also a bridge to Mumbai\u2019s future. \u201cAtal Setu will facilitate the creation of \u2018Third Mumbai\u2019 in the Navi Mumbai-Raigad region,\u201d said Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar. The government has facilitated MMRDA as the New Town Development Authority (NTDA) to focus on the growth of the areas that will be benefitted by the Atal Setu. Third Mumbai is an ambitious smart city that is envisaged in the area close to the upcoming Navi Mumbai International Airport. The project encompasses 124 villages in the Raigad district. Several villages from the existing Navi Mumbai Airport Influence Notified Area are also likely to be a part of the NTDA. The NTDA is expected to oversee [4] _____ area in the Panvel-Ulwe-Uran region where the new airport and the MTHL will offer connectivity. It will feature housing projects, commercial complexes, data centres, IT knowledge parks and financial service hubs. The foundation stone for the airport was laid in 2018. The Rs.18,000 crore project, planned on 1,160 [5] _____, is the largest greenfield airport under development. Just as the MTHL is easing the commute from South Mumbai to Navi Mumbai and beyond, Mumbai Metro has now become a practical alternative to the overcrowded suburban trains for lakhs of Mumbaikaars. The lifeline of commuters, the local trains have been running [6] _____ owing to the multi-fold increase in the number of travellers over the years, especially during peak hours. People in the suburbs are quickly switching to the clean, air-conditioned metro trains to travel to the city. \u201cMetro saves a lot of time,\u201d says Sayali M., a regular commuter from Gundavali to Aarey. \u201cIf I take an autorickshaw on this route, it takes [7] _____ 50 minutes and costs around Rs.150. I cover the same distance by metro in 15 minutes and it costs [8] _____.\u201d Mumbai Metro\u2019s Line 3, which connects the northern suburbs at Aarey to Colaba, the city\u2019s southernmost area, is probably the most crucial infrastructure project in the city. This Rs.30,000 crore, 33.5 km line, which is under construction, will have 26 underground stations and will provide connectivity to major business centres like Nariman Point, Cuffe Parade, Fort and Lower Parel, the business district of Bandra Kurla Complex, and the industrial belt of SEEPZ/MIDC (Santacruz Electronics Export Processing Zone/Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation). A fully operational Line 3 would cater to [9] _____, said Ashwini Bhide, managing director of Mumbai Metro Rail Corporation. \u201cAround 35 percent [of road traffic] is expected to reduce. By 2031, [10] _____ will be expected to reduce every day, which will cut the fuel consumption to the tune of 2.95 lakh litres a day. Around 15 percent burden on suburban railways will also be lessened,\u201d she said. \nExcerpted from: Jathar, Dnyanesh, and Nachiket Kelkar. \u201cMetropolis in Motion.\u201d The Week, 03 Mar 2024, Mumbai, p. 28-37.",

Officially the Atal Setu, the MTHL is also a bridge to Mumbai\u2019s future. \u201cAtal Setu will facilitate the creation of \u2018Third Mumbai\u2019 in the Navi Mumbai-Raigad region,\u201d said Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar. The government has facilitated MMRDA as the New Town Development Authority (NTDA) to focus on the growth of the areas that will be benefitted by the Atal Setu. Third Mumbai is an ambitious smart city that is envisaged in the area close to the upcoming Navi Mumbai International Airport. The project encompasses 124 villages in the Raigad district. Several villages from the existing Navi Mumbai Airport Influence Notified Area are also likely to be a part of the NTDA. The NTDA is expected to oversee [4] _____ area in the Panvel-Ulwe-Uran region where the new airport and the MTHL will offer connectivity. It will feature housing projects, commercial complexes, data centres, IT knowledge parks and financial service hubs. The foundation stone for the airport was laid in 2018. The Rs.18,000 crore project, planned on 1,160 [5] _____, is the largest greenfield airport under development. Just as the MTHL is easing the commute from South Mumbai to Navi Mumbai and beyond, Mumbai Metro has now become a practical alternative to the overcrowded suburban trains for lakhs of Mumbaikaars. The lifeline of commuters, the local trains have been running [6] _____ owing to the multi-fold increase in the number of travellers over the years, especially during peak hours. People in the suburbs are quickly switching to the clean, air-conditioned metro trains to travel to the city. \u201cMetro saves a lot of time,\u201d says Sayali M., a regular commuter from Gundavali to Aarey. \u201cIf I take an autorickshaw on this route, it takes [7] _____ 50 minutes and costs around Rs.150. I cover the same distance by metro in 15 minutes and it costs [8] _____.\u201d Mumbai Metro\u2019s Line 3, which connects the northern suburbs at Aarey to Colaba, the city\u2019s southernmost area, is probably the most crucial infrastructure project in the city. This Rs.30,000 crore, 33.5 km line, which is under construction, will have 26 underground stations and will provide connectivity to major business centres like Nariman Point, Cuffe Parade, Fort and Lower Parel, the business district of Bandra Kurla Complex, and the industrial belt of SEEPZ/MIDC (Santacruz Electronics Export Processing Zone/Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation). A fully operational Line 3 would cater to [9] _____, said Ashwini Bhide, managing director of Mumbai Metro Rail Corporation. \u201cAround 35 percent [of road traffic] is expected to reduce. By 2031, [10] _____ will be expected to reduce every day, which will cut the fuel consumption to the tune of 2.95 lakh litres a day. Around 15 percent burden on suburban railways will also be lessened,\u201d she said. \nExcerpted from: Jathar, Dnyanesh, and Nachiket Kelkar. \u201cMetropolis in Motion.\u201d The Week, 03 Mar 2024, Mumbai, p. 28-37.",

Opened to the public in January, it has reduced the distance between Sewri on the island city and Chirle near the Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust (JNPT) in Raigad district [1] _____ \u2013 from 60 km to 22 km. \u201cThe best thing about the MTHL is the non-stop 22 km journey on the sea bridge,\u201d said Saji S., who commutes 60 km one way from his house in Ambernath to Mumbai every day. For a long time, two bridges over Thane creek linked Mumbai to Navi Mumbai\u2013 the Mulund-Airoli connector and the Vashi connector. The MTHL is the third. \u201cThis bridge is on land, sea and mudflats in between the two,\u201d said Dr. Sanjay Mukherjee, metropolitan commissioner, Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority. \u201cThe seismic strength of the bridge is [2] _____ the normal seismic activity of that region.\u201d The bridge is a six-lane highway that ensures quick connectivity from the city to JNPT, the under-construction Navi Mumbai airport, the expressway to Pune and the national highway to Goa. Shinde said the MTHL was a game changer for commuters and the economy. \u201cWe are connecting the MTHL to the Worli sea link and to Nariman Point via the coastal road,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople living in Nariman Point will now be able to reach Panvel in [3] _____ minutes.\u201d It currently takes more than an hour.

Opened to the public in January, it has reduced the distance between Sewri on the island city and Chirle near the Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust (JNPT) in Raigad district [1] _____ \u2013 from 60 km to 22 km. \u201cThe best thing about the MTHL is the non-stop 22 km journey on the sea bridge,\u201d said Saji S., who commutes 60 km one way from his house in Ambernath to Mumbai every day. For a long time, two bridges over Thane creek linked Mumbai to Navi Mumbai\u2013 the Mulund-Airoli connector and the Vashi connector. The MTHL is the third. \u201cThis bridge is on land, sea and mudflats in between the two,\u201d said Dr. Sanjay Mukherjee, metropolitan commissioner, Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority. \u201cThe seismic strength of the bridge is [2] _____ the normal seismic activity of that region.\u201d The bridge is a six-lane highway that ensures quick connectivity from the city to JNPT, the under-construction Navi Mumbai airport, the expressway to Pune and the national highway to Goa. Shinde said the MTHL was a game changer for commuters and the economy. \u201cWe are connecting the MTHL to the Worli sea link and to Nariman Point via the coastal road,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople living in Nariman Point will now be able to reach Panvel in [3] _____ minutes.\u201d It currently takes more than an hour. The MTHL has given the city the opportunity to grow horizontally. It will be the engine of economic growth for Mumbai and the Mumbai Metropolitan region, said S. V. R. Srinivas, former managing director of MMRDA, who oversaw most of the work on the MTHL during his tenure. Officially the Atal Setu, the MTHL is also a bridge to Mumbai\u2019s future. \u201cAtal Setu will facilitate the creation of \u2018Third Mumbai\u2019 in the Navi Mumbai-Raigad region,\u201d said Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar. The government has facilitated MMRDA as the New Town Development Authority (NTDA) to focus on the growth of the areas that will be benefitted by the Atal Setu. Third Mumbai is an ambitious smart city that is envisaged in the area close to the upcoming Navi Mumbai International Airport. The project encompasses 124 villages in the Raigad district. Several villages from the existing Navi Mumbai Airport Influence Notified Area are also likely to be a part of the NTDA. The NTDA is expected to oversee [4] _____ area in the Panvel-Ulwe-Uran region where the new airport and the MTHL will offer connectivity. It will feature housing projects, commercial complexes, data centres, IT knowledge parks and financial service hubs. The foundation stone for the airport was laid in 2018. The Rs.18,000 crore project, planned on 1,160 [5] _____, is the largest greenfield airport under development. Just as the MTHL is easing the commute from South Mumbai to Navi Mumbai and beyond, Mumbai Metro has now become a practical alternative to the overcrowded suburban trains for lakhs of Mumbaikaars. The lifeline of commuters, the local trains have been running [6] _____ owing to the multi-fold increase in the number of travellers over the years, especially during peak hours. People in the suburbs are quickly switching to the clean, air-conditioned metro trains to travel to the city. \u201cMetro saves a lot of time,\u201d says Sayali M., a regular commuter from Gundavali to Aarey. \u201cIf I take an autorickshaw on this route, it takes [7] _____ 50 minutes and costs around Rs.150. I cover the same distance by metro in 15 minutes and it costs [8] _____.\u201d Mumbai Metro\u2019s Line 3, which connects the northern suburbs at Aarey to Colaba, the city\u2019s southernmost area, is probably the most crucial infrastructure project in the city. This Rs.30,000 crore, 33.5 km line, which is under construction, will have 26 underground stations and will provide connectivity to major business centres like Nariman Point, Cuffe Parade, Fort and Lower Parel, the business district of Bandra Kurla Complex, and the industrial belt of SEEPZ/MIDC (Santacruz Electronics Export Processing Zone/Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation). A fully operational Line 3 would cater to [9] _____, said Ashwini Bhide, managing director of Mumbai Metro Rail Corporation. \u201cAround 35 percent [of road traffic] is expected to reduce. By 2031, [10] _____ will be expected to reduce every day, which will cut the fuel consumption to the tune of 2.95 lakh litres a day. Around 15 percent burden on suburban railways will also be lessened,\u201d she said. \nExcerpted from: Jathar, Dnyanesh, and Nachiket Kelkar. \u201cMetropolis in Motion.\u201d The Week, 03 Mar 2024, Mumbai, p. 28-37.",

Opened to the public in January, it has reduced the distance between Sewri on the island city and Chirle near the Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust (JNPT) in Raigad district [1] _____ \u2013 from 60 km to 22 km. \u201cThe best thing about the MTHL is the non-stop 22 km journey on the sea bridge,\u201d said Saji S., who commutes 60 km one way from his house in Ambernath to Mumbai every day. For a long time, two bridges over Thane creek linked Mumbai to Navi Mumbai\u2013 the Mulund-Airoli connector and the Vashi connector. The MTHL is the third. \u201cThis bridge is on land, sea and mudflats in between the two,\u201d said Dr. Sanjay Mukherjee, metropolitan commissioner, Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority. \u201cThe seismic strength of the bridge is [2] _____ the normal seismic activity of that region.\u201d The bridge is a six-lane highway that ensures quick connectivity from the city to JNPT, the under-construction Navi Mumbai airport, the expressway to Pune and the national highway to Goa. Shinde said the MTHL was a game changer for commuters and the economy. \u201cWe are connecting the MTHL to the Worli sea link and to Nariman Point via the coastal road,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople living in Nariman Point will now be able to reach Panvel in [3] _____ minutes.\u201d It currently takes more than an hour. The MTHL has given the city the opportunity to grow horizontally. It will be the engine of economic growth for Mumbai and the Mumbai Metropolitan region, said S. V. R. Srinivas, former managing director of MMRDA, who oversaw most of the work on the MTHL during his tenure. Officially the Atal Setu, the MTHL is also a bridge to Mumbai\u2019s future. \u201cAtal Setu will facilitate the creation of \u2018Third Mumbai\u2019 in the Navi Mumbai-Raigad region,\u201d said Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar. The government has facilitated MMRDA as the New Town Development Authority (NTDA) to focus on the growth of the areas that will be benefitted by the Atal Setu. Third Mumbai is an ambitious smart city that is envisaged in the area close to the upcoming Navi Mumbai International Airport. The project encompasses 124 villages in the Raigad district. Several villages from the existing Navi Mumbai Airport Influence Notified Area are also likely to be a part of the NTDA. The NTDA is expected to oversee [4] _____ area in the Panvel-Ulwe-Uran region where the new airport and the MTHL will offer connectivity. It will feature housing projects, commercial complexes, data centres, IT knowledge parks and financial service hubs. The foundation stone for the airport was laid in 2018. The Rs.18,000 crore project, planned on 1,160 [5] _____, is the largest greenfield airport under development. Just as the MTHL is easing the commute from South Mumbai to Navi Mumbai and beyond, Mumbai Metro has now become a practical alternative to the overcrowded suburban trains for lakhs of Mumbaikaars. The lifeline of commuters, the local trains have been running [6] _____ owing to the multi-fold increase in the number of travellers over the years, especially during peak hours. People in the suburbs are quickly switching to the clean, air-conditioned metro trains to travel to the city. \u201cMetro saves a lot of time,\u201d says Sayali M., a regular commuter from Gundavali to Aarey. \u201cIf I take an autorickshaw on this route, it takes [7] _____ 50 minutes and costs around Rs.150. I cover the same distance by metro in 15 minutes and it costs [8] _____.\u201d Mumbai Metro\u2019s Line 3, which connects the northern suburbs at Aarey to Colaba, the city\u2019s southernmost area, is probably the most crucial infrastructure project in the city. This Rs.30,000 crore, 33.5 km line, which is under construction, will have 26 underground stations and will provide connectivity to major business centres like Nariman Point, Cuffe Parade, Fort and Lower Parel, the business district of Bandra Kurla Complex, and the industrial belt of SEEPZ/MIDC (Santacruz Electronics Export Processing Zone/Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation). A fully operational Line 3 would cater to [9] _____, said Ashwini Bhide, managing director of Mumbai Metro Rail Corporation. \u201cAround 35 percent [of road traffic] is expected to reduce. By 2031, [10] _____ will be expected to reduce every day, which will cut the fuel consumption to the tune of 2.95 lakh litres a day. Around 15 percent burden on suburban railways will also be lessened,\u201d she said. \nExcerpted from: Jathar, Dnyanesh, and Nachiket Kelkar. \u201cMetropolis in Motion.\u201d The Week, 03 Mar 2024, Mumbai, p. 28-37.",

Srinivas, former managing director of MMRDA, who oversaw most of the work on the MTHL during his tenure. Officially the Atal Setu, the MTHL is also a bridge to Mumbai\u2019s future. \u201cAtal Setu will facilitate the creation of \u2018Third Mumbai\u2019 in the Navi Mumbai-Raigad region,\u201d said Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar. The government has facilitated MMRDA as the New Town Development Authority (NTDA) to focus on the growth of the areas that will be benefitted by the Atal Setu. Third Mumbai is an ambitious smart city that is envisaged in the area close to the upcoming Navi Mumbai International Airport. The project encompasses 124 villages in the Raigad district. Several villages from the existing Navi Mumbai Airport Influence Notified Area are also likely to be a part of the NTDA. The NTDA is expected to oversee [4] _____ area in the Panvel-Ulwe-Uran region where the new airport and the MTHL will offer connectivity. It will feature housing projects, commercial complexes, data centres, IT knowledge parks and financial service hubs. The foundation stone for the airport was laid in 2018. The Rs.18,000 crore project, planned on 1,160 [5] _____, is the largest greenfield airport under development. Just as the MTHL is easing the commute from South Mumbai to Navi Mumbai and beyond, Mumbai Metro has now become a practical alternative to the overcrowded suburban trains for lakhs of Mumbaikaars. The lifeline of commuters, the local trains have been running [6] _____ owing to the multi-fold increase in the number of travellers over the years, especially during peak hours. People in the suburbs are quickly switching to the clean, air-conditioned metro trains to travel to the city. \u201cMetro saves a lot of time,\u201d says Sayali M., a regular commuter from Gundavali to Aarey. \u201cIf I take an autorickshaw on this route, it takes [7] _____ 50 minutes and costs around Rs.150. I cover the same distance by metro in 15 minutes and it costs [8] _____.\u201d Mumbai Metro\u2019s Line 3, which connects the northern suburbs at Aarey to Colaba, the city\u2019s southernmost area, is probably the most crucial infrastructure project in the city. This Rs.30,000 crore, 33.5 km line, which is under construction, will have 26 underground stations and will provide connectivity to major business centres like Nariman Point, Cuffe Parade, Fort and Lower Parel, the business district of Bandra Kurla Complex, and the industrial belt of SEEPZ/MIDC (Santacruz Electronics Export Processing Zone/Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation). A fully operational Line 3 would cater to [9] _____, said Ashwini Bhide, managing director of Mumbai Metro Rail Corporation. \u201cAround 35 percent [of road traffic] is expected to reduce. By 2031, [10] _____ will be expected to reduce every day, which will cut the fuel consumption to the tune of 2.95 lakh litres a day. Around 15 percent burden on suburban railways will also be lessened,\u201d she said. \nExcerpted from: Jathar, Dnyanesh, and Nachiket Kelkar. \u201cMetropolis in Motion.\u201d The Week, 03 Mar 2024, Mumbai, p. 28-37."

Opened to the public in January, it has reduced the distance between Sewri on the island city and Chirle near the Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust (JNPT) in Raigad district [1] _____ \u2013 from 60 km to 22 km. \u201cThe best thing about the MTHL is the non-stop 22 km journey on the sea bridge,\u201d said Saji S., who commutes 60 km one way from his house in Ambernath to Mumbai every day. For a long time, two bridges over Thane creek linked Mumbai to Navi Mumbai\u2013 the Mulund-Airoli connector and the Vashi connector. The MTHL is the third. \u201cThis bridge is on land, sea and mudflats in between the two,\u201d said Dr. Sanjay Mukherjee, metropolitan commissioner, Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority. \u201cThe seismic strength of the bridge is [2] _____ the normal seismic activity of that region.\u201d The bridge is a six-lane highway that ensures quick connectivity from the city to JNPT, the under-construction Navi Mumbai airport, the expressway to Pune and the national highway to Goa. Shinde said the MTHL was a game changer for commuters and the economy. \u201cWe are connecting the MTHL to the Worli sea link and to Nariman Point via the coastal road,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople living in Nariman Point will now be able to reach Panvel in [3] _____ minutes.\u201d It currently takes more than an hour. The MTHL has given the city the opportunity to grow horizontally. It will be the engine of economic growth for Mumbai and the Mumbai Metropolitan region, said S. V. R. Srinivas, former managing director of MMRDA, who oversaw most of the work on the MTHL during his tenure. Officially the Atal Setu, the MTHL is also a bridge to Mumbai\u2019s future. \u201cAtal Setu will facilitate the creation of \u2018Third Mumbai\u2019 in the Navi Mumbai-Raigad region,\u201d said Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar. The government has facilitated MMRDA as the New Town Development Authority (NTDA) to focus on the growth of the areas that will be benefitted by the Atal Setu. Third Mumbai is an ambitious smart city that is envisaged in the area close to the upcoming Navi Mumbai International Airport. The project encompasses 124 villages in the Raigad district. Several villages from the existing Navi Mumbai Airport Influence Notified Area are also likely to be a part of the NTDA. The NTDA is expected to oversee [4] _____ area in the Panvel-Ulwe-Uran region where the new airport and the MTHL will offer connectivity. It will feature housing projects, commercial complexes, data centres, IT knowledge parks and financial service hubs. The foundation stone for the airport was laid in 2018. The Rs.18,000 crore project, planned on 1,160 [5] _____, is the largest greenfield airport under development. Just as the MTHL is easing the commute from South Mumbai to Navi Mumbai and beyond, Mumbai Metro has now become a practical alternative to the overcrowded suburban trains for lakhs of Mumbaikaars. The lifeline of commuters, the local trains have been running [6] _____ owing to the multi-fold increase in the number of travellers over the years, especially during peak hours. People in the suburbs are quickly switching to the clean, air-conditioned metro trains to travel to the city. \u201cMetro saves a lot of time,\u201d says Sayali M., a regular commuter from Gundavali to Aarey. \u201cIf I take an autorickshaw on this route, it takes [7] _____ 50 minutes and costs around Rs.150. I cover the same distance by metro in 15 minutes and it costs [8] _____.\u201d Mumbai Metro\u2019s Line 3, which connects the northern suburbs at Aarey to Colaba, the city\u2019s southernmost area, is probably the most crucial infrastructure project in the city. This Rs.30,000 crore, 33.5 km line, which is under construction, will have 26 underground stations and will provide connectivity to major business centres like Nariman Point, Cuffe Parade, Fort and Lower Parel, the business district of Bandra Kurla Complex, and the industrial belt of SEEPZ/MIDC (Santacruz Electronics Export Processing Zone/Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation). A fully operational Line 3 would cater to [9] _____, said Ashwini Bhide, managing director of Mumbai Metro Rail Corporation. \u201cAround 35 percent [of road traffic] is expected to reduce. By 2031, [10] _____ will be expected to reduce every day, which will cut the fuel consumption to the tune of 2.95 lakh litres a day. Around 15 percent burden on suburban railways will also be lessened,\u201d she said. \nExcerpted from: Jathar, Dnyanesh, and Nachiket Kelkar. \u201cMetropolis in Motion.\u201d The Week, 03 Mar 2024, Mumbai, p. 28-37.",

Opened to the public in January, it has reduced the distance between Sewri on the island city and Chirle near the Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust (JNPT) in Raigad district [1] _____ \u2013 from 60 km to 22 km. \u201cThe best thing about the MTHL is the non-stop 22 km journey on the sea bridge,\u201d said Saji S., who commutes 60 km one way from his house in Ambernath to Mumbai every day. For a long time, two bridges over Thane creek linked Mumbai to Navi Mumbai\u2013 the Mulund-Airoli connector and the Vashi connector. The MTHL is the third. \u201cThis bridge is on land, sea and mudflats in between the two,\u201d said Dr. Sanjay Mukherjee, metropolitan commissioner, Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority. \u201cThe seismic strength of the bridge is [2] _____ the normal seismic activity of that region.\u201d The bridge is a six-lane highway that ensures quick connectivity from the city to JNPT, the under-construction Navi Mumbai airport, the expressway to Pune and the national highway to Goa. Shinde said the MTHL was a game changer for commuters and the economy. \u201cWe are connecting the MTHL to the Worli sea link and to Nariman Point via the coastal road,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople living in Nariman Point will now be able to reach Panvel in [3] _____ minutes.\u201d It currently takes more than an hour. The MTHL has given the city the opportunity to grow horizontally. It will be the engine of economic growth for Mumbai and the Mumbai Metropolitan region, said S. V. R. Srinivas, former managing director of MMRDA, who oversaw most of the work on the MTHL during his tenure. Officially the Atal Setu, the MTHL is also a bridge to Mumbai\u2019s future. \u201cAtal Setu will facilitate the creation of \u2018Third Mumbai\u2019 in the Navi Mumbai-Raigad region,\u201d said Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar. The government has facilitated MMRDA as the New Town Development Authority (NTDA) to focus on the growth of the areas that will be benefitted by the Atal Setu. Third Mumbai is an ambitious smart city that is envisaged in the area close to the upcoming Navi Mumbai International Airport. The project encompasses 124 villages in the Raigad district. Several villages from the existing Navi Mumbai Airport Influence Notified Area are also likely to be a part of the NTDA. The NTDA is expected to oversee [4] _____ area in the Panvel-Ulwe-Uran region where the new airport and the MTHL will offer connectivity. It will feature housing projects, commercial complexes, data centres, IT knowledge parks and financial service hubs. The foundation stone for the airport was laid in 2018. The Rs.18,000 crore project, planned on 1,160 [5] _____, is the largest greenfield airport under development. Just as the MTHL is easing the commute from South Mumbai to Navi Mumbai and beyond, Mumbai Metro has now become a practical alternative to the overcrowded suburban trains for lakhs of Mumbaikaars. The lifeline of commuters, the local trains have been running [6] _____ owing to the multi-fold increase in the number of travellers over the years, especially during peak hours. People in the suburbs are quickly switching to the clean, air-conditioned metro trains to travel to the city. \u201cMetro saves a lot of time,\u201d says Sayali M., a regular commuter from Gundavali to Aarey. \u201cIf I take an autorickshaw on this route, it takes [7] _____ 50 minutes and costs around Rs.150. I cover the same distance by metro in 15 minutes and it costs [8] _____.\u201d Mumbai Metro\u2019s Line 3, which connects the northern suburbs at Aarey to Colaba, the city\u2019s southernmost area, is probably the most crucial infrastructure project in the city. This Rs.30,000 crore, 33.5 km line, which is under construction, will have 26 underground stations and will provide connectivity to major business centres like Nariman Point, Cuffe Parade, Fort and Lower Parel, the business district of Bandra Kurla Complex, and the industrial belt of SEEPZ/MIDC (Santacruz Electronics Export Processing Zone/Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation). A fully operational Line 3 would cater to [9] _____, said Ashwini Bhide, managing director of Mumbai Metro Rail Corporation. \u201cAround 35 percent [of road traffic] is expected to reduce. By 2031, [10] _____ will be expected to reduce every day, which will cut the fuel consumption to the tune of 2.95 lakh litres a day. Around 15 percent burden on suburban railways will also be lessened,\u201d she said. \nExcerpted from: Jathar, Dnyanesh, and Nachiket Kelkar. \u201cMetropolis in Motion.\u201d The Week, 03 Mar 2024, Mumbai, p. 28-37.",

Opened to the public in January, it has reduced the distance between Sewri on the island city and Chirle near the Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust (JNPT) in Raigad district [1] _____ \u2013 from 60 km to 22 km. \u201cThe best thing about the MTHL is the non-stop 22 km journey on the sea bridge,\u201d said Saji S., who commutes 60 km one way from his house in Ambernath to Mumbai every day. For a long time, two bridges over Thane creek linked Mumbai to Navi Mumbai\u2013 the Mulund-Airoli connector and the Vashi connector. The MTHL is the third. \u201cThis bridge is on land, sea and mudflats in between the two,\u201d said Dr. Sanjay Mukherjee, metropolitan commissioner, Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority. \u201cThe seismic strength of the bridge is [2] _____ the normal seismic activity of that region.\u201d The bridge is a six-lane highway that ensures quick connectivity from the city to JNPT, the under-construction Navi Mumbai airport, the expressway to Pune and the national highway to Goa. Shinde said the MTHL was a game changer for commuters and the economy. \u201cWe are connecting the MTHL to the Worli sea link and to Nariman Point via the coastal road,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople living in Nariman Point will now be able to reach Panvel in [3] _____ minutes.\u201d It currently takes more than an hour. The MTHL has given the city the opportunity to grow horizontally. It will be the engine of economic growth for Mumbai and the Mumbai Metropolitan region, said S. V. R. Srinivas, former managing director of MMRDA, who oversaw most of the work on the MTHL during his tenure. Officially the Atal Setu, the MTHL is also a bridge to Mumbai\u2019s future. \u201cAtal Setu will facilitate the creation of \u2018Third Mumbai\u2019 in the Navi Mumbai-Raigad region,\u201d said Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar. The government has facilitated MMRDA as the New Town Development Authority (NTDA) to focus on the growth of the areas that will be benefitted by the Atal Setu. Third Mumbai is an ambitious smart city that is envisaged in the area close to the upcoming Navi Mumbai International Airport. The project encompasses 124 villages in the Raigad district. Several villages from the existing Navi Mumbai Airport Influence Notified Area are also likely to be a part of the NTDA. The NTDA is expected to oversee [4] _____ area in the Panvel-Ulwe-Uran region where the new airport and the MTHL will offer connectivity. It will feature housing projects, commercial complexes, data centres, IT knowledge parks and financial service hubs. The foundation stone for the airport was laid in 2018. The Rs.18,000 crore project, planned on 1,160 [5] _____, is the largest greenfield airport under development. Just as the MTHL is easing the commute from South Mumbai to Navi Mumbai and beyond, Mumbai Metro has now become a practical alternative to the overcrowded suburban trains for lakhs of Mumbaikaars. The lifeline of commuters, the local trains have been running [6] _____ owing to the multi-fold increase in the number of travellers over the years, especially during peak hours. People in the suburbs are quickly switching to the clean, air-conditioned metro trains to travel to the city. \u201cMetro saves a lot of time,\u201d says Sayali M., a regular commuter from Gundavali to Aarey. \u201cIf I take an autorickshaw on this route, it takes [7] _____ 50 minutes and costs around Rs.150. I cover the same distance by metro in 15 minutes and it costs [8] _____.\u201d Mumbai Metro\u2019s Line 3, which connects the northern suburbs at Aarey to Colaba, the city\u2019s southernmost area, is probably the most crucial infrastructure project in the city. This Rs.30,000 crore, 33.5 km line, which is under construction, will have 26 underground stations and will provide connectivity to major business centres like Nariman Point, Cuffe Parade, Fort and Lower Parel, the business district of Bandra Kurla Complex, and the industrial belt of SEEPZ/MIDC (Santacruz Electronics Export Processing Zone/Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation). A fully operational Line 3 would cater to [9] _____, said Ashwini Bhide, managing director of Mumbai Metro Rail Corporation. \u201cAround 35 percent [of road traffic] is expected to reduce. By 2031, [10] _____ will be expected to reduce every day, which will cut the fuel consumption to the tune of 2.95 lakh litres a day. Around 15 percent burden on suburban railways will also be lessened,\u201d she said. \nExcerpted from: Jathar, Dnyanesh, and Nachiket Kelkar. \u201cMetropolis in Motion.\u201d The Week, 03 Mar 2024, Mumbai, p. 28-37.",

                            "Read the following and answer the given subquestions:\n\nThe MTHL and Mumbai\u2019s Changing Face \nThe longest sea bridge in India, the MTHL was commissioned when Fadnavis was chief minister; construction began in 2016. Opened to the public in January, it has reduced the distance between Sewri on the island city and Chirle near the Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust (JNPT) in Raigad district [1] _____ \u2013 from 60 km to 22 km. \u201cThe best thing about the MTHL is the non-stop 22 km journey on the sea bridge,\u201d said Saji S., who commutes 60 km one way from his house in Ambernath to Mumbai every day. For a long time, two bridges over Thane creek linked Mumbai to Navi Mumbai\u2013 the Mulund-Airoli connector and the Vashi connector. The MTHL is the third. \u201cThis bridge is on land, sea and mudflats in between the two,\u201d said Dr. Sanjay Mukherjee, metropolitan commissioner, Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority. \u201cThe seismic strength of the bridge is [2] _____ the normal seismic activity of that region.\u201d The bridge is a six-lane highway that ensures quick connectivity from the city to JNPT, the under-construction Navi Mumbai airport, the expressway to Pune and the national highway to Goa. Shinde said the MTHL was a game changer for commuters and the economy. \u201cWe are connecting the MTHL to the Worli sea link and to Nariman Point via the coastal road,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople living in Nariman Point will now be able to reach Panvel in [3] _____ minutes.\u201d It currently takes more than an hour. The MTHL has given the city the opportunity to grow horizontally. It will be the engine of economic growth for Mumbai and the Mumbai Metropolitan region, said S. V. R. Srinivas, former managing director of MMRDA, who oversaw most of the work on the MTHL during his tenure. Officially the Atal Setu, the MTHL is also a bridge to Mumbai\u2019s future. \u201cAtal Setu will facilitate the creation of \u2018Third Mumbai\u2019 in the Navi Mumbai-Raigad region,\u201d said Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar. The government has facilitated MMRDA as the New Town Development Authority (NTDA) to focus on the growth of the areas that will be benefitted by the Atal Setu. Third Mumbai is an ambitious smart city that is envisaged in the area close to the upcoming Navi Mumbai International Airport. The project encompasses 124 villages in the Raigad district. Several villages from the existing Navi Mumbai Airport Influence Notified Area are also likely to be a part of the NTDA. The NTDA is expected to oversee [4] _____ area in the Panvel-Ulwe-Uran region where the new airport and the MTHL will offer connectivity. It will feature housing projects, commercial complexes, data centres, IT knowledge parks and financial service hubs. The foundation stone for the airport was laid in 2018. The Rs.18,000 crore project, planned on 1,160 [5] _____, is the largest greenfield airport under development. Just as the MTHL is easing the commute from South Mumbai to Navi Mumbai and beyond, Mumbai Metro has now become a practical alternative to the overcrowded suburban trains for lakhs of Mumbaikaars. The lifeline of commuters, the local trains have been running [6] _____ owing to the multi-fold increase in the number of travellers over the years, especially during peak hours. People in the suburbs are quickly switching to the clean, air-conditioned metro trains to travel to the city. \u201cMetro saves a lot of time,\u201d says Sayali M., a regular commuter from Gundavali to Aarey. \u201cIf I take an autorickshaw on this route, it takes [7] _____ 50 minutes and costs around Rs.150. I cover the same distance by metro in 15 minutes and it costs [8] _____.\u201d Mumbai Metro\u2019s Line 3, which connects the northern suburbs at Aarey to Colaba, the city\u2019s southernmost area, is probably the most crucial infrastructure project in the city. This Rs.30,000 crore, 33.5 km line, which is under construction, will have 26 underground stations and will provide connectivity to major business centres like Nariman Point, Cuffe Parade, Fort and Lower Parel, the business district of Bandra Kurla Complex, and the industrial belt of SEEPZ/MIDC (Santacruz Electronics Export Processing Zone/Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation). A fully operational Line 3 would cater to [9] _____, said Ashwini Bhide, managing director of Mumbai Metro Rail Corporation. \u201cAround 35 percent [of road traffic] is expected to reduce. By 2031, [10] _____ will be expected to reduce every day, which will cut the fuel consumption to the tune of 2.95 lakh litres a day. Around 15 percent burden on suburban railways will also be lessened,\u201d she said. \nExcerpted from: Jathar, Dnyanesh, and Nachiket Kelkar. \u201cMetropolis in Motion.\u201d The Week, 03 Mar 2024, Mumbai, p. 28-37."

Opened to the public in January, it has reduced the distance between Sewri on the island city and Chirle near the Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust (JNPT) in Raigad district [1] _____ \u2013 from 60 km to 22 km. \u201cThe best thing about the MTHL is the non-stop 22 km journey on the sea bridge,\u201d said Saji S., who commutes 60 km one way from his house in Ambernath to Mumbai every day. For a long time, two bridges over Thane creek linked Mumbai to Navi Mumbai\u2013 the Mulund-Airoli connector and the Vashi connector. The MTHL is the third. \u201cThis bridge is on land, sea and mudflats in between the two,\u201d said Dr. Sanjay Mukherjee, metropolitan commissioner, Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority. \u201cThe seismic strength of the bridge is [2] _____ the normal seismic activity of that region.\u201d The bridge is a six-lane highway that ensures quick connectivity from the city to JNPT, the under-construction Navi Mumbai airport, the expressway to Pune and the national highway to Goa. Shinde said the MTHL was a game changer for commuters and the economy. \u201cWe are connecting the MTHL to the Worli sea link and to Nariman Point via the coastal road,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople living in Nariman Point will now be able to reach Panvel in [3] _____ minutes.\u201d It currently takes more than an hour. The MTHL has given the city the opportunity to grow horizontally. It will be the engine of economic growth for Mumbai and the Mumbai Metropolitan region, said S. V. R. Srinivas, former managing director of MMRDA, who oversaw most of the work on the MTHL during his tenure. Officially the Atal Setu, the MTHL is also a bridge to Mumbai\u2019s future. \u201cAtal Setu will facilitate the creation of \u2018Third Mumbai\u2019 in the Navi Mumbai-Raigad region,\u201d said Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar. The government has facilitated MMRDA as the New Town Development Authority (NTDA) to focus on the growth of the areas that will be benefitted by the Atal Setu. Third Mumbai is an ambitious smart city that is envisaged in the area close to the upcoming Navi Mumbai International Airport. The project encompasses 124 villages in the Raigad district. Several villages from the existing Navi Mumbai Airport Influence Notified Area are also likely to be a part of the NTDA. The NTDA is expected to oversee [4] _____ area in the Panvel-Ulwe-Uran region where the new airport and the MTHL will offer connectivity. It will feature housing projects, commercial complexes, data centres, IT knowledge parks and financial service hubs. The foundation stone for the airport was laid in 2018. The Rs.18,000 crore project, planned on 1,160 [5] _____, is the largest greenfield airport under development. Just as the MTHL is easing the commute from South Mumbai to Navi Mumbai and beyond, Mumbai Metro has now become a practical alternative to the overcrowded suburban trains for lakhs of Mumbaikaars. The lifeline of commuters, the local trains have been running [6] _____ owing to the multi-fold increase in the number of travellers over the years, especially during peak hours. People in the suburbs are quickly switching to the clean, air-conditioned metro trains to travel to the city. \u201cMetro saves a lot of time,\u201d says Sayali M., a regular commuter from Gundavali to Aarey. \u201cIf I take an autorickshaw on this route, it takes [7] _____ 50 minutes and costs around Rs.150. I cover the same distance by metro in 15 minutes and it costs [8] _____.\u201d Mumbai Metro\u2019s Line 3, which connects the northern suburbs at Aarey to Colaba, the city\u2019s southernmost area, is probably the most crucial infrastructure project in the city. This Rs.30,000 crore, 33.5 km line, which is under construction, will have 26 underground stations and will provide connectivity to major business centres like Nariman Point, Cuffe Parade, Fort and Lower Parel, the business district of Bandra Kurla Complex, and the industrial belt of SEEPZ/MIDC (Santacruz Electronics Export Processing Zone/Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation). A fully operational Line 3 would cater to [9] _____, said Ashwini Bhide, managing director of Mumbai Metro Rail Corporation. \u201cAround 35 percent [of road traffic] is expected to reduce. By 2031, [10] _____ will be expected to reduce every day, which will cut the fuel consumption to the tune of 2.95 lakh litres a day. Around 15 percent burden on suburban railways will also be lessened,\u201d she said. \nExcerpted from: Jathar, Dnyanesh, and Nachiket Kelkar. \u201cMetropolis in Motion.\u201d The Week, 03 Mar 2024, Mumbai, p. 28-37.",
