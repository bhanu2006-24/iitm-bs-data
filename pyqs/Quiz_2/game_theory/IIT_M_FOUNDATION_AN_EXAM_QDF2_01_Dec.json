Probability and Conditional Probability\n- **Core Concepts**: Probability of events, conditional probability, Bayes' Theorem.\n- **Key Equations**:\n  - Probability of an event: \\( P(E) \\)\n  - Conditional Probability: \\( P(A|B) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)} \\)\n  - Bayes' Theorem: \\( P(A|B) = \\frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} \\)\n\n#### 2. Game Theory\n- **Core Concepts**: Nash Equilibrium, Payoff Matrices, Best Responses, Repeated Games, Discount Factors.\n- **Key Equations**:\n  - Payoff Function: \\( v_i(a_1, a_2) = a_i - 2a_j + a_ia_j - (a_j)^2 \\)\n  - Discount Factor: \\( \\delta = \\frac{1}{5} \\)\n\n#### 3. Stable Matching (Gale-Shapley Algorithm)\n- **Core Concepts**: Stable matching, preferences, proposals.\n- **Key Concepts**: Understanding how to apply the Gale-Shapley algorithm to find stable matches based on preference lists.\n\n#### 4. Bayesian Games\n- **Core Concepts**: Incomplete information, expected payoffs, types of players.\n- **Key Equations**:\n  - Expected Payoff: \\( E[v_i] = \\sum P(\\text{type}) \\times v_i(\\text{type}) \\)\n\n### Knowledge Graph \n\n#### Graph 1: Probability and Conditional Probability\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[Probability] --> B[Conditional Probability];\n    A --> C[Bayes' Theorem];\n    B --> D[Probability of Sequences];\n    C --> D;\n```\n\n#### Graph 2: Game Theory\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[Game Theory] --> B[Nash Equilibrium];\n    A --> C[Payoff Matrices];\n    A --> D[Best Responses];\n    A --> E[Repeated Games];\n    E --> F[Discount Factors];\n```\n\n#### Graph 3: Stable Matching\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[Stable Matching] --> B[Gale-Shapley Algorithm];\n    B --> C[Preferences];\n    B --> D[Proposals];\n```\n\n#### Graph 4: Bayesian Games\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[Bayesian Games] --> B[Incomplete Information];\n    A --> C[Expected Payoffs];\n    A --> D[Types of Players];\n```\n\nThese graphs and summaries should help you understand the core topics and their relationships, making it easier to prepare for the exam.",
