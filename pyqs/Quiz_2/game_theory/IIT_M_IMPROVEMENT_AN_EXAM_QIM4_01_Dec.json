Probability and Urn Problems\n- **Concepts**: Probability of drawing balls from urns, conditional probability, Bayes' theorem.\n- **Principles**: Understanding the probability of different sequences of draws and updating beliefs based on observed outcomes.\n- **Equations**:\n  - Probability of drawing a blue ball from a blue-majority urn: \\( P(\\text{Blue}) = \\frac{4}{5} \\)\n  - Probability of the urn being blue-majority given a red draw: \\( P(\\text{Blue-majority} | \\text{Red}) = \\frac{1}{5} \\)\n  - Probability of a sequence (Blue, Blue, Red) from a blue-majority urn: \\( P(\\text{BBR} | \\text{Blue-majority}) = \\frac{16}{125} \\)\n  - Probability of a sequence (Blue, Blue, Red) from a red-majority urn: \\( P(\\text{BBR} | \\text{Red-majority}) = \\frac{4}{125} \\)\n  - Total probability of the sequence (Blue, Blue, Red): \\( P(\\text{BBR}) = \\frac{2}{25} \\)\n\n#### 2. Nash Equilibrium and Best Response\n- **Concepts**: Best response, Nash equilibrium, payoff functions.\n- **Principles**: Understanding how players choose their best response given the actions of other players and finding the equilibrium where no player can benefit by changing their strategy.\n- **Equations**:\n  - Payoff function: \\( v_i(a_1, a_2) = a_i - 2a_j + a_ia_j - (a_j)^2 \\)\n  - Best response and equilibrium calculations.\n\n#### 3. Repeated Games and Discount Factors\n- **Concepts**: Infinitely repeated games, discount factors, subgame perfect equilibrium.\n- **Principles**: Understanding how cooperation can be sustained in repeated games and the role of discount factors in determining the stability of agreements.\n- **Equations**:\n  - Payoff in each stage game if players stick to the agreement: \\( v_i(0, 0) = 0 \\)\n  - Discount factor conditions for supporting agreements: \\( \\delta \\in (0, 1) \\)\n\n#### 4. Stable Matching and Gale-Shapley Algorithm\n- **Concepts**: Stable matching, Gale-Shapley algorithm.\n- **Principles**: Understanding how to find stable matches in a bipartite graph where preferences are given.\n- **Equations**: None specific, but understanding the algorithm and its steps is crucial.\n\n#### 5. Bayesian Games and Expected Payoffs\n- **Concepts**: Bayesian games, incomplete information, expected payoffs.\n- **Principles**: Understanding how players make decisions based on their beliefs about the types of other players and calculating expected payoffs.\n- **Equations**:\n  - Expected payoff calculations based on probabilities and payoff matrices.\n\n### Mermaid Knowledge Graph\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[Game Theory] --> B[Probability and Urn Problems];\n    A --> C[Nash Equilibrium];\n    A --> D[Repeated Games];\n    A --> E[Stable Matching];\n    A --> F[Bayesian Games];\n\n    B --> B1[Conditional Probability];\n    B --> B2[Bayes' Theorem];\n\n    C --> C1[Best Response];\n    C --> C2[Payoff Functions];\n\n    D --> D1[Infinitely Repeated Games];\n    D --> D2[Discount Factors];\n\n    E --> E1[Gale-Shapley Algorithm];\n\n    F --> F1[Incomplete Information];\n    F --> F2[Expected Payoffs];\n```\n\nThis graph visually maps the relationships between the core topics in game theory covered in the exam.
