Here is a summary of the core topics, concepts, principles, and equations that are essential to study for the exam:\n\n#### 1. **Probability and Conditional Probability**\n   - **Concepts**: Understanding basic probability, conditional probability, and Bayes' Theorem.\n   - **Equations**:\n     - Probability of an event: \\( P(E) \\)\n     - Conditional Probability: \\( P(A|B) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)} \\)\n     - Bayes' Theorem: \\( P(A|B) = \\frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} \\)\n\n#### 2. **Game Theory Basics**\n   - **Concepts**: Normal form games, payoff matrices, best responses, and Nash Equilibrium.\n   - **Equations**:\n     - Payoff function: \\( v_i(a_1, a_2) = a_i - 2a_j + a_ia_j - (a_i)^2 \\)\n     - Best response: The action that maximizes a player's payoff given the other player's action.\n\n#### 3. **Repeated Games and Discount Factors**\n   - **Concepts**: Infinitely repeated games, discount factors, and subgame perfect equilibrium.\n   - **Equations**:\n     - Discount factor: \\( \\delta \\)\n     - Present value of future payoffs: \\( V = \\sum_{t=0}^{\\infty} \\delta^t v_t \\)\n\n#### 4. **Stable Matching**\n   - **Concepts**: Gale-Shapley algorithm for stable matching.\n   - **Principles**: Understanding how to apply the Gale-Shapley algorithm to find stable matches between two sets of participants.\n\n#### 5. **Bayesian Games**\n   - **Concepts**: Games with incomplete information, types of players, and expected payoffs.\n   - **Equations**:\n     - Expected payoff: \\( E[v_i] = \\sum_{j} P(\\text{type}_j) \\cdot v_i(\\text{action}_i, \\text{action}_j) \\)\n\n#### 6. **Voting Systems**\n   - **Concepts**: Borda count, completeness, and transitivity in ranking alternatives.\n   - **Principles**: Understanding how Borda count works and its properties.\n\n### Knowledge Graph \n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[Probability] --> B[Conditional Probability];\n    A --> C[Bayes' Theorem];\n    D[Game Theory] --> E[Normal Form Games];\n    D --> F[Payoff Matrices];\n    D --> G[Best Responses];\n    D --> H[Nash Equilibrium];\n    I[Repeated Games] --> J[Discount Factors];\n    I --> K[Subgame Perfect Equilibrium];\n    L[Stable Matching] --> M[Gale-Shapley Algorithm];\n    N[Bayesian Games] --> O[Incomplete Information];\n    N --> P[Expected Payoffs];\n    Q[Voting Systems] --> R[Borda Count];\n    Q --> S[Completeness and Transitivity];\n```\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    T[Probability and Conditional Probability] --> U[Urns and Balls];\n    T --> V[Sequential Drawing];\n    W[Game Theory Basics] --> X[Payoff Function];\n    W --> Y[Best Response];\n    W --> Z[Nash Equilibrium];\n    AA[Repeated Games] --> AB[Discount Factors];\n    AA --> AC[Subgame Perfect Equilibrium];\n    AD[Stable Matching] --> AE[Gale-Shapley Algorithm];\n    AF[Bayesian Games] --> AG[Expected Payoffs];\n    AH[Voting Systems] --> AI[Borda Count];\n```\n\nThese graphs visually map the relationships between the core topics, making it easier to understand how they interconnect.",
