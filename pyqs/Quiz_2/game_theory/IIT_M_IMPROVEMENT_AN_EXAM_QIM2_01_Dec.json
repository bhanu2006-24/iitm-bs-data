Probability and Conditional Probability\n- **Core Topics**: Probability theory, conditional probability, Bayes' Theorem.\n- **Concepts**: Understanding the probability of drawing balls from urns, updating probabilities based on new information.\n- **Equations**:\n  - Probability of drawing a blue ball from a blue-majority urn: \\( P(\\text{Blue}) = \\frac{4}{5} \\)\n  - Probability of the urn being blue-majority given a red ball is drawn: \\( P(\\text{Blue-majority} | \\text{Red}) = \\frac{1}{5} \\)\n  - Probability of a sequence of draws: \\( P(\\text{Blue, Blue, Red} | \\text{Blue-majority}) = \\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)^2 \\times \\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{16}{125} \\)\n\n#### 2. Game Theory\n- **Core Topics**: Nash Equilibrium, Best Response, Payoff Functions, Repeated Games, Discount Factors.\n- **Concepts**: Understanding strategic interactions, best responses, and equilibrium outcomes.\n- **Equations**:\n  - Payoff function for player \\( i \\): \\( v_i(a_1, a_2) = a_i - 2a_j + a_ia_j - (a_i)^2 \\)\n  - Best response condition: \\( \\frac{\\partial v_i}{\\partial a_i} = 0 \\)\n  - Equilibrium payoff: \\( v_i(a_1, a_2) = -1 \\) when \\( a_1 = a_2 = 1 \\)\n\n#### 3. Gale-Shapley Algorithm\n- **Core Topics**: Stable Matching, Preferences, Matching Algorithms.\n- **Concepts**: Understanding stable matching in two-sided markets, preferences, and the Gale-Shapley algorithm.\n- **Equations**: None specific, but understanding the algorithm steps and preference structures is crucial.\n\n#### 4. Bayesian Games\n- **Core Topics**: Incomplete Information, Expected Payoffs, Probabilistic Reasoning.\n- **Concepts**: Understanding games with incomplete information, calculating expected payoffs, and Bayesian updating.\n- **Equations**:\n  - Expected payoff calculations based on probabilities and payoff matrices.\n  - Example: \\( E[U_1(B)] = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 3 + \\frac{2}{3} \\times 3 = 3 \\)\n\n### Mermaid Knowledge Graph\n\n#### Graph 1: Probability and Conditional Probability\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[Probability Theory] --> B[Conditional Probability];\n    A --> C[Bayes' Theorem];\n    B --> D[Probability of Drawing Balls];\n    C --> D;\n    D --> E[Updating Probabilities];\n```\n\n#### Graph 2: Game Theory\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[Game Theory] --> B[Nash Equilibrium];\n    A --> C[Best Response];\n    A --> D[Payoff Functions];\n    B --> E[Strategic Interactions];\n    C --> E;\n    D --> E;\n    E --> F[Equilibrium Outcomes];\n```\n\n#### Graph 3: Gale-Shapley Algorithm\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[Stable Matching] --> B[Preferences];\n    A --> C[Gale-Shapley Algorithm];\n    B --> D[Preference Structures];\n    C --> D;\n    D --> E[Matching Algorithms];\n```\n\n#### Graph 4: Bayesian Games\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[Bayesian Games] --> B[Incomplete Information];\n    A --> C[Expected Payoffs];\n    A --> D[Probabilistic Reasoning];\n    B --> E[Games with Incomplete Information];\n    C --> E;\n    D --> E;\n    E --> F[Bayesian Updating];\n```\n\nThese graphs and summaries should help you understand the core topics and their relationships, making it easier to prepare for the exam.",
