**Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: A class should have only one reason to change.\n  - **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**: Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.\n  - **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**: Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.\n  - **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**: Objects should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of the program.\n  - **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules but on abstractions.\n\n- **Design Patterns**:\n  - **Facade Pattern**: Providing a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.\n  - **Builder Design Pattern**: Separating the construction of a complex object from its representation.\n  - **Adapter Pattern**: Converting the interface of a class into another interface clients expect.\n  - **Strategy Design Pattern**: Defining a family of algorithms, encapsulating each one, and making them interchangeable.\n\n#### 4. **Software Architecture**\n- **Client-Server Architecture**: Separation of concerns between client and server.\n- **Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Architecture**: Decentralized architecture where each node has equal responsibilities.\n- **Model-View-Controller (MVC)**: Separating the internal representations of information from the ways information is presented and accepted by the user.\n\n#### 5. **Coupling and Cohesion**\n- **Coupling**: The degree of interdependence between software modules.\n  - **Control Coupling**: When one module controls the flow of another module.\n  - **Content Coupling**: When one module directly modifies or relies on the internal workings of another module.\n  - **Data Coupling**: When modules share data through parameters.\n  - **Common Coupling**: When modules share global data.\n\n- **Cohesion**: The degree to which the elements inside a module belong together.\n\n#### 6. **Prototyping**\n- **Storyboard**: Visual representation of the user interface.\n- **Paper Prototype**: Hand-drawn sketches of the user interface.\n- **Digital Mock-up**: Digital representation of the user interface.\n- **Interactive Prototype**: Functional prototype that allows user interaction.\n\n#### 7. **Software Testing and Debugging**\n- **Black Box Debugging**: Testing without knowledge of the internal workings of the system.\n- **White Box Debugging**: Testing with knowledge of the internal workings of the system.\n- **Cyclomatic Complexity**: A software metric that measures the complexity of a program by counting the number of independent paths through the source code.\n\n#### 8. **Software Metrics and Estimation**\n- **COCOMO Model**: Constructive Cost Model for estimating software development effort.\n  - **Organic Project**: \\( a = 2.4, b = 1.05 \\)\n  - **Semi-detached Project**: \\( a = 3.0, b = 1.12 \\)\n  - **Embedded Project**: \\( a = 3.6, b = 1.20 \\)\n  - **Effort Calculation**: \\( E = a \\times (KLOC)^b \\times EAF \\)\n  - **EAF (Effort Adjustment Factor)**: Product of cost driver multipliers.\n\n#### 9. **User Experience and Learnability**\n- **Learnability**: Ease with which new users can learn to use the system.\n- **Step-by-Step Wizard**: Guiding users through each section.\n- **Templates**: Predefined formats for common user profiles.\n\n#### 10. **Risk Management**\n- **Technical Risk**: Risks related to the technical aspects of the project.\n- **Mitigation Strategies**: Benchmarking, regular inspections, user feedback surveys.\n\n### Knowledge Graph \n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[Software Development Methodologies] --> B[Agile Methodology];\n    A --> C[Waterfall Model];\n    A --> D[Prototyping];\n    A --> E[Spiral Model];\n    F[Requirements Analysis] --> G[Stakeholder Analysis];\n    F --> H[Requirement Gathering Techniques];\n    F --> I[SMART Criteria];\n    F --> J[Requirement Issues];\n    K[Software Design Principles] --> L[SOLID Principles];\n    K --> M[Design Patterns];\n    N[Software Architecture] --> O[Client-Server Architecture];\n    N --> P[Peer-to-Peer Architecture];\n    N --> Q[Model-View-Controller];\n    R[Coupling and Cohesion] --> S[Control Coupling];\n    R --> T[Content Coupling];\n    R --> U[Data Coupling];\n    R --> V[Common Coupling];\n    W[Prototyping] --> X[Storyboard];\n    W --> Y[Paper Prototype];\n    W --> Z[Digital Mock-up];\n    W --> AA[Interactive Prototype];\n    AB[Software Testing and Debugging] --> AC[Black Box Debugging];\n    AB --> AD[White Box Debugging];\n    AB --> AE[Cyclomatic Complexity];\n    AF[Software Metrics and Estimation] --> AG[COCOMO Model];\n    AH[User Experience and Learnability] --> AI[Learnability];\n    AH --> AJ[Step-by-Step Wizard];\n    AH --> AK[Templates];\n    AL[Risk Management] --> AM[Technical Risk];\n    AL --> AN[Mitigation Strategies];\n```\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    B[Agile Methodology] --> BA[Iterative Development];\n    B --> BB[Customer Collaboration];\n    B --> BC[Responding to Change];\n    C[Waterfall Model] --> CA[Sequential Development];\n    D[Prototyping] --> DA[Early Models];\n    E[Spiral Model] --> EA[Iterative Development];\n    E --> EB[Systematic Aspects];\n    G[Stakeholder Analysis] --> GA[Primary Users];\n    G --> GB[Secondary Users];\n    G --> GC[Tertiary Users];\n    H[Requirement Gathering Techniques] --> HA[Documentation];\n    H --> HB[Interviews];\n    H --> HC[Focus Groups];\n    H --> HD[Observation];\n    I[SMART Criteria] --> IA[Specific];\n    I --> IB[Measurable];\n    I --> IC[Achievable];\n    I --> ID[Relevant];\n    I --> IE[Time-bound];\n    J[Requirement Issues] --> JA[Incomplete];\n    J --> JB[Ambiguous];\n    J --> JC[Inconsistent];\n    J --> JD[Implicit];\n    L[SOLID Principles] --> LA[Single Responsibility Principle];\n    L --> LB[Interface Segregation Principle];\n    L --> LC[Open/Closed Principle];\n    L --> LD[Liskov Substitution Principle];\n    L --> LE[Dependency Inversion Principle];\n    M[Design Patterns] --> MA[Facade Pattern];\n    M --> MB[Builder Design Pattern];\n    M --> MC[Adapter Pattern];\n    M --> MD[Strategy Design Pattern];\n```\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    O[Client-Server Architecture] --> OA[Separation of Concerns];\n    P[Peer-to-Peer Architecture] --> PA[Decentralized Architecture];\n    Q[Model-View-Controller] --> QA[Separation of Internal Representations];\n    S[Control Coupling] --> SA[Flow Control];\n    T[Content Coupling] --> TA[Direct Modification];\n    U[Data Coupling] --> UA[Data Sharing];\n    V[Common Coupling] --> VA[Global Data];\n    X[Storyboard] --> XA[Visual Representation];\n    Y[Paper Prototype] --> YA[Hand-drawn Sketches];\n    Z[Digital Mock-up] --> ZA[Digital Representation];\n    AA[Interactive Prototype] --> AA[Functional Prototype];\n    AC[Black Box Debugging] --> ACA[Testing without Internal Knowledge];\n    AD[White Box Debugging] --> ADA[Testing with Internal Knowledge];\n    AE[Cyclomatic Complexity] --> AEA[Complexity Measurement];\n    AG[COCOMO Model] --> AGA[Organic Project];\n    AG --> AGB[Semi-detached Project];\n    AG --> AGC[Embedded Project];\n    AG --> AGD[Effort Calculation];\n    AI[Learnability] --> AIA[Ease of Learning];\n    AJ[Step-by-Step Wizard] --> AJA[Guiding Users];\n    AK[Templates] --> AKA[Predefined Formats];\n    AM[Technical Risk] --> AMA[Technical Aspects];\n    AN[Mitigation Strategies] --> ANA[Benchmarking];\n    AN --> ANB[Regular Inspections];\n    AN --> ANC[User Feedback Surveys];\n```\n\nThese graphs provide a visual representation of the relationships between the core topics, concepts, principles, and equations essential for the exam.",
