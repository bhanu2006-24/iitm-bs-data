**Waterfall Model**: Sequential development process with distinct phases.\n   - **Prototype Model**: Involves creating prototypes for early feedback.\n\n2. **Requirements Analysis**\n   - **User Stories**: Descriptions of features from an end-user perspective.\n   - **SMART Criteria**: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound.\n   - **Requirement Gathering Techniques**: Documentation, interviews, focus groups, observation.\n\n3. **Software Design Principles**\n   - **SOLID Principles**:\n     - **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: A class should have only one reason to change.\n     - **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**: Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.\n   - **Design Patterns**:\n     - **Facade Pattern**: Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.\n     - **Adapter Pattern**: Allows incompatible interfaces to work together.\n     - **Builder Design Pattern**: Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation.\n     - **Strategy Design Pattern**: Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.\n\n4. **Software Quality Attributes**\n   - **Learnability**: Ease with which new users can learn to use the system.\n   - **Efficiency**: Optimizing resource usage.\n   - **Maintainability**: Ease of maintaining and updating the system.\n   - **Understandability**: Ease with which the system can be understood.\n\n5. **Software Metrics**\n   - **Cyclomatic Complexity**: Measures the complexity of a program by counting the number of linearly independent paths.\n     - Formula: \\( \\text{Cyclomatic Complexity} = \\text{Number of decision points} + 1 \\)\n\n6. **Software Architecture**\n   - **Client-Server Architecture**: Separates the client and server roles.\n   - **Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Architecture**: Decentralized architecture where each node acts as both a client and a server.\n   - **Model-View-Controller (MVC)**: Separates the application into three interconnected components.\n\n7. **Coupling and Cohesion**\n   - **Control Coupling**: When one module controls the flow of another module.\n   - **Data Coupling**: When modules share data.\n   - **Common Coupling**: When modules share a common data area.\n   - **Content Coupling**: When one module directly modifies or relies on the internal workings of another module.\n\n8. **Prototyping**\n   - **Storyboard**: Visual representation of the user interface.\n   - **Paper Prototype**: Low-fidelity prototype using paper.\n   - **Digital Mock-up**: High-fidelity prototype using digital tools.\n   - **Interactive Prototype**: Functional prototype that allows user interaction.\n\n9. **Risk Management**\n   - **Technical Risk**: Risks related to the technical aspects of the project.\n   - **Business Risk**: Risks related to the business aspects of the project.\n   - **Project Risk**: Risks related to the project management aspects.\n   - **Legal Risk**: Risks related to legal aspects.\n\n10. **Effort Estimation**\n    - **COCOMO Model**: Constructive Cost Model for estimating software development effort.\n      - Formula: \\( \\text{Effort} = a \\times (\\text{KLOC})^b \\)\n      - Constants \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) vary based on the type of project (Organic, Semi-detached, Embedded).\n\n#### Mermaid Knowledge Graph\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[Software Engineering] --> B[Software Development Methodologies];\n    A --> C[Requirements Analysis];\n    A --> D[Software Design Principles];\n    A --> E[Software Quality Attributes];\n    A --> F[Software Metrics];\n    A --> G[Software Architecture];\n    A --> H[Coupling and Cohesion];\n    A --> I[Prototyping];\n    A --> J[Risk Management];\n    A --> K[Effort Estimation];\n\n    B --> B1[Agile Methodology];\n    B --> B2[Waterfall Model];\n    B --> B3[Prototype Model];\n\n    C --> C1[User Stories];\n    C --> C2[SMART Criteria];\n    C --> C3[Requirement Gathering Techniques];\n\n    D --> D1[SOLID Principles];\n    D --> D2[Design Patterns];\n\n    D1 --> D1a[Single Responsibility Principle];\n    D1 --> D1b[Interface Segregation Principle];\n\n    D2 --> D2a[Facade Pattern];\n    D2 --> D2b[Adapter Pattern];\n    D2 --> D2c[Builder Design Pattern];\n    D2 --> D2d[Strategy Design Pattern];\n\n    E --> E1[Learnability];\n    E --> E2[Efficiency];\n    E --> E3[Maintainability];\n    E --> E4[Understandability];\n\n    F --> F1[Cyclomatic Complexity];\n\n    G --> G1[Client-Server Architecture];\n    G --> G2[Peer-to-Peer Architecture];\n    G --> G3[Model-View-Controller];\n\n    H --> H1[Control Coupling];\n    H --> H2[Data Coupling];\n    H --> H3[Common Coupling];\n    H --> H4[Content Coupling];\n\n    I --> I1[Storyboard];\n    I --> I2[Paper Prototype];\n    I --> I3[Digital Mock-up];\n    I --> I4[Interactive Prototype];\n\n    J --> J1[Technical Risk];\n    J --> J2[Business Risk];\n    J --> J3[Project Risk];\n    J --> J4[Legal Risk];\n\n    K --> K1[COCOMO Model];\n```\n\nThis summary and knowledge graph should help you understand the core topics, concepts, principles, and equations essential for the exam.",
