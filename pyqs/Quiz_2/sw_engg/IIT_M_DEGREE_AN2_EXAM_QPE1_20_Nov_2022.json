**Mitigation Strategies**: Benchmarking, regular inspections, client feedback, prototyping\n\n2. **Agile Development**\n   - **User Stories**: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Timeboxed (SMART)\n   - **Sprint Activities**: Sprint planning, Sprint standup meeting, Sprint review, Sprint retrospective\n   - **Product Backlog**: Responsibility of Product owner, Scrum master, and Development team\n\n3. **Design Patterns**\n   - **Adapter Design Pattern**: Used to make incompatible classes work together\n   - **Builder Design Pattern**: Reduces complexity in code with multiple attributes\n   - **Factory Design Pattern**: Creates objects without specifying the exact class\n   - **Facade Design Pattern**: Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem\n\n4. **Software Metrics**\n   - **Raw Metrics**: LOC (Lines of Code), LLOC (Logical Lines of Code), SLOC (Source Lines of Code)\n   - **Cyclomatic Complexity**: Measures the complexity of a program\n   - **Halstead\u2019s Metrics**: Measures software complexity and development effort\n\n5. **Software Development Models**\n   - **Waterfall Model**: Linear and sequential approach\n   - **Spiral Model**: Iterative development with risk assessment\n   - **Prototype Model**: Building a prototype for early feedback\n   - **Agile Model**: Iterative and incremental development with user stories, sprints, and test-driven development (TDD)\n\n6. **Requirement Collection Techniques**\n   - **Questionnaires**: Surveys to gather information\n   - **Focus Group**: Group discussions to gather requirements\n   - **Documentations**: Reviewing existing documents\n   - **Naturalistic Observations**: Observing users in their natural environment\n\n7. **Usability Goals**\n   - **Effectiveness**: Completing tasks accurately and completely\n   - **Efficiency**: Completing tasks quickly\n   - **Safe to Use**: Protecting users from dangerous conditions and undesirable situations\n   - **Learnability**: Ease of learning to use the system\n   - **Memorability**: Ease of remembering how to use the system\n\n8. **Coupling Types**\n   - **Data Coupling**: Modules share data through parameters\n   - **Control Coupling**: Modules share control information\n   - **Common Coupling**: Modules share a global data structure\n   - **Content Coupling**: Modules modify each other's internal data\n\n9. **Debugging Strategies**\n   - **Input Manipulation**: Changing input to observe behavior\n   - **Backwards Strategy**: Working backward from the point of failure\n   - **Forwards Strategy**: Following the data control flow from the triggering event\n   - **Blackbox Debugging**: Testing without knowledge of internal workings\n\n10. **Software Architecture**\n    - **Client-Server System**: Centralized system with clients and servers\n    - **Pipe and Filter**: Data processing through a series of filters\n    -
