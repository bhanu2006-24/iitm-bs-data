**Waterfall Model**: Sequential development process with distinct phases.\n   - **Spiral Model**: Combines iterative development with systematic aspects of the waterfall model.\n   - **Prototype Model**: Involves creating prototypes early in the development process.\n\n2. **Requirements Analysis**\n   - **Stakeholder Analysis**: Identifying and categorizing stakeholders (primary, secondary, tertiary).\n   - **Requirements Gathering Techniques**: Documentation, interviews, focus groups, observation.\n   - **SMART Criteria**: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound.\n   - **User Stories**: Descriptions of a software feature from an end-user perspective.\n\n3. **Software Design Principles**\n   - **SOLID Principles**:\n     - **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: A class should have only one reason to change.\n     - **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**: Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.\n     - **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**: Objects should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of the program.\n     - **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**: Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.\n     - **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules but on abstractions.\n   - **Design Patterns**:\n     - **Facade Pattern**: Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.\n     - **Adapter Pattern**: Allows incompatible interfaces to work together.\n     - **Builder Pattern**: Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation.\n     - **Strategy Pattern**: Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.\n\n4. **Software Quality Attributes**\n   - **Learnability**: Ease with which new users can begin effective interaction and achieve maximal performance.\n   - **Efficiency**: Optimal use of resources (e.g., memory, processing power).\n   - **Maintainability**: Ease with which a software system can be modified to correct faults, improve performance, or adapt to a changed environment.\n   - **Understandability**: Ease with which the software can be understood by developers and users.\n\n5. **Software Testing and Debugging**\n   - **Cyclomatic Complexity**: A software metric used to measure the complexity of a program by counting the number of linearly independent paths.\n   - **Debugging Techniques**: Black box debugging, step-by-step debugging, dump and diff comparison.\n\n6. **Software Architecture**\n   - **Client-Server Architecture**: Separates the client (user interface) from the server (data processing).\n   - **Model-View-Controller (MVC)**: Separates the application into three interconnected components.\n   - **Pipe and Filter Architecture**: Processes data through a series of filters.\n   - **Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Architecture**: Decentralized architecture where each node has equal responsibilities.\n\n7. **Coupling and Cohesion**\n   - **Coupling**: The degree of interdependence between software modules.\n     - **Control Coupling**: When one module controls the flow of another module.\n     - **Content Coupling**: When one module directly modifies or relies on the internal workings of another module.\n     - **Data Coupling**: When modules share data through parameters.\n     - **Common Coupling**: When modules share global data.\n   - **Cohesion**: The degree to which the elements inside a module belong together.\n\n8. **Risk Management**\n   - **Technical Risk**: Risks related to the technical aspects of the project, such as software bugs or hardware failures.\n   - **Business Risk**: Risks related to the business aspects, such as market changes or financial issues.\n   - **Project Risk**: Risks related to the project management aspects, such as schedule delays or resource constraints.\n   - **Legal Risk**: Risks related to legal aspects, such as compliance with regulations or intellectual property issues.\n\n9. **Effort Estimation**\n   - **COCOMO Model**: Constructive Cost Model used to estimate the effort required for software development.\n     - **Organic Project**: Small, straightforward projects with small teams.\n     - **Semi-Detached Project**: Medium-sized projects with a mix of experienced and new developers.\n     - **Embedded Project**: Large, complex projects with stringent requirements.\n     - **Effort Calculation**: \\( \\text{Effort} = a \\times (\\text{KLOC})^b \\times \\text{Cost Drivers} \\)\n\n#### Equations\n1. **Cyclomatic Complexity**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cyclomatic Complexity} = \\text{Number of Decision Points} + 1\n   \\]\n2. **COCOMO Model**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Effort} = a \\times (\\text{KLOC})^b \\times \\text{Cost Drivers}\n   \\]\n   Where:\n   - \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are constants based on the project type.\n   - \\( \\text{KLOC} \\) is the estimated size of the project in thousands of lines of code.\n   - \\( \\text{Cost Drivers} \\) are multipliers based on various project attributes.\n\n### Knowledge Graph \n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    SoftwareEngineering-->SoftwareDevelopmentMethodologies;\n    SoftwareEngineering-->RequirementsAnalysis;\n    SoftwareEngineering-->SoftwareDesignPrinciples;\n    SoftwareEngineering-->SoftwareQualityAttributes;\n    SoftwareEngineering-->SoftwareTestingandDebugging;\n    SoftwareEngineering-->SoftwareArchitecture;\n    SoftwareEngineering-->CouplingandCohesion;\n    SoftwareEngineering-->RiskManagement;\n    SoftwareEngineering-->EffortEstimation;\n\n    SoftwareDevelopmentMethodologies-->AgileMethodology;\n    SoftwareDevelopmentMethodologies-->WaterfallModel;\n    SoftwareDevelopmentMethodologies-->SpiralModel;\n    SoftwareDevelopmentMethodologies-->PrototypeModel;\n\n    RequirementsAnalysis-->StakeholderAnalysis;\n    RequirementsAnalysis-->RequirementsGatheringTechniques;\n    RequirementsAnalysis-->SMARTCriteria;\n    RequirementsAnalysis-->UserStories;\n\n    SoftwareDesignPrinciples-->SOLIDPrinciples;\n    SoftwareDesignPrinciples-->DesignPatterns;\n\n    SoftwareQualityAttributes-->Learnability;\n    SoftwareQualityAttributes-->Efficiency;\n    SoftwareQualityAttributes-->Maintainability;\n    SoftwareQualityAttributes-->Understandability;\n\n    SoftwareTestingandDebugging-->CyclomaticComplexity;\n    SoftwareTestingandDebugging-->DebuggingTechniques;\n\n    SoftwareArchitecture-->ClientServerArchitecture;\n    SoftwareArchitecture-->ModelViewController;\n    SoftwareArchitecture-->PipeandFilterArchitecture;\n    SoftwareArchitecture-->PeertoPeerArchitecture;\n\n    CouplingandCohesion-->Coupling;\n    CouplingandCohesion-->Cohesion;\n\n    RiskManagement-->TechnicalRisk;\n    RiskManagement-->BusinessRisk;\n    RiskManagement-->ProjectRisk;\n    RiskManagement-->LegalRisk;\n\n    EffortEstimation-->COCOMOMODEL;\n```\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    SOLIDPrinciples-->SingleResponsibilityPrinciple;\n    SOLIDPrinciples-->OpenClosedPrinciple;\n    SOLIDPrinciples-->LiskovSubstitutionPrinciple;\n    SOLIDPrinciples-->InterfaceSegregationPrinciple;\n    SOLIDPrinciples-->DependencyInversionPrinciple;\n\n    DesignPatterns-->FacadePattern;\n    DesignPatterns-->AdapterPattern;\n    DesignPatterns-->BuilderPattern;\n    DesignPatterns-->StrategyPattern;\n```\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    Coupling-->ControlCoupling;\n    Coupling-->ContentCoupling;\n    Coupling-->DataCoupling;\n    Coupling-->CommonCoupling;\n```\n\nThese graphs provide a visual representation of the relationships between the core topics in software engineering, making it easier to understand the connections and dependencies between different concepts.",
