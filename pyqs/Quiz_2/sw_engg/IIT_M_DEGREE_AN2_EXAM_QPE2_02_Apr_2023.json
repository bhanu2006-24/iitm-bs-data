**Waterfall Model**: Sequential phases, users see the product after testing.\n  - **Agile Model**: Iterative development, user stories, product backlog.\n  - **Prototype Model**: Early prototypes for user feedback.\n  - **Spiral Model**: Iterative development with risk assessment.\n\n#### Requirements Gathering\n- **Techniques**: Interviews, Focus groups, Naturalistic observations, Documentation\n- **User Stories**: Should be achievable, measurable, relevant, and timeboxed.\n\n#### Usability Goals\n- **Learnability**: Ease with which new users can learn to use the software.\n- **Effectiveness**: Ability of users to complete tasks.\n- **Efficiency**: Speed with which users can complete tasks.\n- **Safety**: Protection against errors and misuse.\n- **Memorability**: Ease with which users can remember how to use the software.\n\n#### User Types\n- **Primary Users**: Direct users of the software.\n- **Secondary Users**: Indirect users who interact with the software occasionally.\n- **Tertiary Users**: Users affected by the software but do not interact directly.\n\n#### Software Metrics\n- **Raw Metrics**: Lines of Code (LOC), Logical Lines of Code (LLOC), Source Lines of Code (SLOC).\n- **Cyclomatic Complexity**: Measures the complexity of a program.\n- **Halstead\u2019s Metrics**: Measures program complexity based on operators and operands.\n- **Code Smell**: Indicators of poor code quality.\n\n#### UML Diagrams\n- **Activity Diagram**: Represents workflows of stepwise activities.\n- **State Machine View**: Represents states and transitions.\n- **Interaction View**: Represents the sequence of messages exchanged between different parts of the system.\n\n#### Risk Management\n- **Technical Risk**: Risks related to the technical aspects of the project.\n- **Project Risks**: Risks related to project management.\n- **Business Risk**: Risks related to business aspects.\n- **Risk Calculation**: Risk = Probability of occurrence * Impact.\n\n#### COCOMO Model\n- **Equation**: Effort = a * (KLOC)^b * EAF\n  - **Organic Project**: a = 2.4, b = 1.05\n  - **Semi-detached Project**: a = 3.0, b = 1.12\n  - **Embedded Project**: a = 3.6, b = 1.20\n  - **EAF**: Effort Adjustment Factor\n\n#### Design Patterns\n- **Adapter Design Pattern**: Converts the interface of a class into another interface clients expect.\n- **Facade Design Pattern**: Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.\n- **Builder Design Pattern**: Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation.\n- **Strategy Design Pattern**: Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.\n\n#### Debugging\n- **Error**: Discrepancy between actual behavior and intended behavior.\n- **Failure**: Observable errors like incorrect output value, exception, etc.\n- **Fault**: Where the failure has occurred.\n- **Debugging**: Determining the cause of failure.\n- **Debugging Strategies**:\n  - **Forwards Strategy**: Follow the data control flow ahead until the incorrect state is reached.\n  - **Backwards Strategy**: Work backward from the point of failure to find the cause.\n\n#### Software Architecture\n- **Client-Server**: Separates the client and server roles.\n- **Pipe and Filter**: Connects filters where the output of one is the input to the next.\n- **Model-View-Controller (MVC)**: Separates the application into three interconnected components.\n- **Peer-to-Peer**: Decentralized architecture where each peer has equal capabilities.\n\n#### SOLID Principles\n- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: A class should have only one reason to change.\n- **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**: Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.\n- **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**: Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program.\n- **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**: Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface.\n- **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**: Depend upon abstractions, do not depend upon concretions.\n\n### Knowledge Graph \n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Software Development Life Cycle] --> B[Requirements Gathering]\n    A --> C[Design]\n    A --> D[Development]\n    A --> E[Testing]\n    A --> F[Maintenance]\n    B --> G[Interviews]\n    B --> H[Focus Groups]\n    B --> I[Naturalistic Observations]\n    B --> J[Documentation]\n    C --> K[Waterfall Model]\n    C --> L[Agile Model]\n    C --> M[Prototype Model]\n    C --> N[Spiral Model]\n    D --> O[User Stories]\n    D --> P[Product Backlog]\n    E --> Q[Usability Goals]\n    Q --> R[Learnability]\n    Q --> S[Effectiveness]\n    Q --> T[Efficiency]\n    Q --> U[Safety]\n    Q --> V[Memorability]\n    F --> W[Software Metrics]\n    W --> X[Raw Metrics]\n    W --> Y[Cyclomatic Complexity]\n    W --> Z[Halstead\u2019s Metrics]\n    W --> AA[Code Smell]\n    A --> AB[UML Diagrams]\n    AB --> AC[Activity Diagram]\n    AB --> AD[State Machine View]\n    AB --> AE[Interaction View]\n    A --> AF[Risk Management]\n    AF --> AG[Technical Risk]\n    AF --> AH[Project Risks]\n    AF --> AI[Business Risk]\n    AF --> AJ[Risk Calculation]\n    A --> AK[COCOMO Model]\n    AK --> AL[Organic Project]\n    AK --> AM[Semi-detached Project]\n    AK --> AN[Embedded Project]\n    A --> AO[Design Patterns]\n    AO --> AP[Adapter Design Pattern]\n    AO --> AQ[Facade Design Pattern]\n    AO --> AR[Builder Design Pattern]\n    AO --> AS[Strategy Design Pattern]\n    A --> AT[Debugging]\n    AT --> AU[Error]\n    AT --> AV[Failure]\n    AT --> AW[Fault]\n    AT --> AX[Debugging Strategies]\n    AX --> AY[Forwards Strategy]\n    AX --> AZ[Backwards Strategy]\n    A --> BA[Software Architecture]\n    BA --> BB[Client-Server]\n    BA --> BC[Pipe and Filter]\n    BA --> BD[Model-View-Controller]\n    BA --> BE[Peer-to-Peer]\n    A --> BF[SOLID Principles]\n    BF --> BG[Single Responsibility Principle]\n    BF --> BH[Open/Closed Principle]\n    BF --> BI[Liskov Substitution Principle]\n    BF --> BJ[Interface Segregation Principle]\n    BF --> BK[Dependency Inversion Principle]\n```\n\nThis knowledge graph visually maps the relationships between the core topics in software engineering, providing a clear and easy-to-understand overview of the subject.",
