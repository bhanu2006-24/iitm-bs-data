        "summary": "### Summary of Core Topics, Concepts, Principles, and Equations\n\n#### Software Engineering Concepts\n1. **Requirements Gathering Techniques**\n   - **Interviews**: To explore issues.\n   - **Focus Groups**: To collect multiple viewpoints.\n   - **Naturalistic Observations**: To understand the context.\n   - **Documentation**: To understand procedures, regulations, and standards.\n\n2. **Functional vs. Non-Functional Requirements**\n   - **Functional Requirements**: Describe what the system should do (e.g., search for grocery items, display brand options).\n   - **Non-Functional Requirements**: Describe how the system should behave (e.g., support 100 simultaneous client requests, generate invoice within a second).\n\n3. **Design Patterns**\n   - **Adapter Pattern**: Converts the interface of a class into another interface clients expect.\n   - **Facade Pattern**: Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.\n   - **Builder Pattern**: Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation.\n   - **Factory Pattern**: Provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.\n\n4. **Usability Goals**\n   - **Efficiency**: How quickly users can perform tasks.\n   - **Memorability**: How easily users can remember how to use the system.\n   - **Safety**: Protecting users from dangerous conditions and undesirable situations.\n   - **Learnability**: How easily new users can learn to use the system.\n\n5. **SMART Characteristics**\n   - **Specific**: Clear and precise.\n   - **Measurable**: Quantifiable outcomes.\n   - **Achievable**: Realistic and attainable.\n   - **Relevant**: Aligned with goals.\n   - **Time-bound**: Defined time frame.\n\n6. **Software Architecture**\n   - **Client-Server System**: Centralized server provides services to clients.\n   - **Pipe and Filter**: Data processing through a series of filters.\n   - **Model-View-Controller (MVC)**: Separates the application into three interconnected components.\n   - **Peer-to-Peer Architecture**: Decentralized network where each node can act as both a client and a server.\n\n7. **Debugging Strategies**\n   - **Backwards Debugging**: Start from the point of failure and work backwards.\n   - **Blackbox Debugging**: Debugging without knowledge of the internal code implementation.\n   - **Forwards Debugging**: Start from the beginning and work forwards.\n   - **Input Manipulation Debugging**: Manipulate inputs to identify issues.\n\n8. **UML Diagrams**\n   - **Class Diagram**: Shows the classes in the system and their relationships.\n   - **State Machine View**: Shows the states of an object and the transitions between states.\n   - **Activity View**: Shows the flow of activities in the system.\n   - **Interaction View**: Shows the sequence of message exchanges between objects.\n\n9. **Cohesion Types**\n   - **Sequential Cohesion**: Output of one function is input to another.\n   - **Procedural Cohesion**: Functions are related by the order in which they are executed.\n   - **Coincidental Cohesion**: Functions are unrelated.\n   - **Communicational Cohesion**: Functions operate on the same data.\n\n10. **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)**\n    - **Requirements Gathering**: Collecting and analyzing requirements.\n    - **Design**: Creating a blueprint of the system.\n    - **Development**: Writing the code.\n    - **Testing**: Verifying the system meets requirements.\n    - **Maintenance**: Updating and improving the system.\n\n11. **Design Heuristics**\n    - **Consistency**: Uniformity in design.\n    - **Show Status**: Visibility of system status.\n    - **Recognition over Recall**: Minimize the user's memory load.\n    - **Support Error Recovery**: Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors.\n\n12. **Coupling and Cohesion**\n    - **High Cohesion**: Modules perform a single, well-defined task.\n    - **Low Coupling**: Modules are independent and interact minimally.\n\n13. **Scrum Activities**\n    - **Sprint Planning**: Planning the work for the sprint.\n    - **Daily Scrum Meeting**: Daily updates on progress and issues.\n    - **Sprint Review**: Reviewing the work completed during the sprint.\n    - **Sprint Retrospective**: Reflecting on the sprint to improve future sprints.\n\n14. **SOLID Principles**\n    - **Open/Closed Principle**: Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.\n    - **Liskov Substitution Principle**: Objects should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of the program.\n    - **Interface Segregation Principle**: Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.\n    - **Dependency Inversion Principle**: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules but on abstractions.\n\n15. **COCOMO Model**\n    - **Organic Project**: \\( a = 2.4, b = 1.05 \\)\n    - **Semi-Detached Project**: \\( a = 3.0, b = 1.12 \\)\n    - **Embedded Project**: \\( a = 3.6, b = 1.20 \\)\n    - **Effort Calculation**: \\( E = a \\times (KLOC)^b \\)\n    - **Cost Calculation**: \\( Cost = E \\times Salary \\)\n\n16. **Prototype Model Advantages**\n    - Provides an early view of the product.\n    - Enables early rectification of requirements.\n\n17. **Risk Types and Mitigation**\n    - **Technical Risk**: Risks related to technology.\n    - **Project Risk**: Risks related to project management.\n    - **Business Risk**: Risks related to market and competition.\n    - **Mitigation Strategies**: Communicating with clients, benchmarking, market exploration, detailed milestones, and frequent communication.\n\n### Mermaid Knowledge Graph\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    SoftwareEngineering --> RequirementsGathering;\n    SoftwareEngineering --> FunctionalVsNonFunctional;\n    SoftwareEngineering --> DesignPatterns;\n    SoftwareEngineering --> UsabilityGoals;\n    SoftwareEngineering --> SMARTCharacteristics;\n    SoftwareEngineering --> SoftwareArchitecture;\n    SoftwareEngineering --> DebuggingStrategies;\n    SoftwareEngineering --> UMldiagrams;\n    SoftwareEngineering --> CohesionTypes;\n    SoftwareEngineering --> SDLC;\n    SoftwareEngineering --> DesignHeuristics;\n    SoftwareEngineering --> CouplingAndCohesion;\n    SoftwareEngineering --> ScrumActivities;\n    SoftwareEngineering --> SOLIDPrinciples;\n    SoftwareEngineering --> COCOMOModel;\n    SoftwareEngineering --> PrototypeModel;\n    SoftwareEngineering --> RiskManagement;\n\n    RequirementsGathering --> Interviews;\n    RequirementsGathering --> FocusGroups;\n    RequirementsGathering --> NaturalisticObservations;\n    RequirementsGathering --> Documentation;\n\n    DesignPatterns --> AdapterPattern;\n    DesignPatterns --> FacadePattern;\n    DesignPatterns --> BuilderPattern;\n    DesignPatterns --> FactoryPattern;\n\n    UsabilityGoals --> Efficiency;\n    UsabilityGoals --> Memorability;\n    UsabilityGoals --> Safety;\n    UsabilityGoals --> Learnability;\n\n    SoftwareArchitecture --> ClientServerSystem;\n    SoftwareArchitecture --> PipeAndFilter;\n    SoftwareArchitecture --> MVC;\n    SoftwareArchitecture --> PeerToPeer;\n\n    DebuggingStrategies --> BackwardsDebugging;\n    DebuggingStrategies --> BlackboxDebugging;\n    DebuggingStrategies --> ForwardsDebugging;\n    DebuggingStrategies --> InputManipulationDebugging;\n\n    UMldiagrams --> ClassDiagram;\n    UMldiagrams --> StateMachineView;\n    UMldiagrams --> ActivityView;\n    UMldiagrams --> InteractionView;\n\n    CohesionTypes --> SequentialCohesion;\n    CohesionTypes --> ProceduralCohesion;\n    CohesionTypes --> CoincidentalCohesion;\n    CohesionTypes --> CommunicationalCohesion;\n\n    SDLC --> RequirementsGathering;\n    SDLC --> Design;\n    SDLC --> Development;\n    SDLC --> Testing;\n    SDLC --> Maintenance;\n\n    DesignHeuristics --> Consistency;\n    DesignHeuristics --> ShowStatus;\n    DesignHeuristics --> RecognitionOverRecall;\n    DesignHeuristics --> SupportErrorRecovery;\n\n    ScrumActivities --> SprintPlanning;\n    ScrumActivities --> DailyScrumMeeting;\n    ScrumActivities --> SprintReview;\n    ScrumActivities --> SprintRetrospective;\n\n    SOLIDPrinciples --> OpenClosedPrinciple;\n    SOLIDPrinciples --> LiskovSubstitutionPrinciple;\n    SOLIDPrinciples --> InterfaceSegregationPrinciple;\n    SOLIDPrinciples --> DependencyInversionPrinciple;\n\n    RiskManagement --> TechnicalRisk;\n    RiskManagement --> ProjectRisk;\n    RiskManagement --> BusinessRisk;\n```\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    COCOMOModel --> OrganicProject;\n    COCOMOModel --> SemiDetachedProject;\n    COCOMOModel --> EmbeddedProject;\n    COCOMOModel --> EffortCalculation;\n    COCOMOModel --> CostCalculation;\n\n    EffortCalculation -->|Formula| E[\"E = a \u00d7 (KLOC)^b\"];\n    CostCalculation -->|Formula| C[\"Cost = E \u00d7 Salary\"];\n```\n\nThis summary and knowledge graph should help you understand the core topics, concepts, principles, and equations essential for the exam.",
