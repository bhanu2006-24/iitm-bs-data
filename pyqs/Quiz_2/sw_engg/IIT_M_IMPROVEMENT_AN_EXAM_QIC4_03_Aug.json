Key principles include welcoming changing requirements and delivering working software frequently.\n   - **Waterfall Model**: A sequential design process where progress is seen as flowing steadily downwards through phases of conception, initiation, analysis, design, construction, testing, production/implementation, and maintenance.\n\n2. **Requirements Analysis**\n   - **Gathering Techniques**: Documentation, interviews, focus groups, and observation.\n   - **Types of Requirements**: Functional, non-functional, and user requirements.\n   - **SMART Criteria**: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound.\n\n3. **Software Design Principles**\n   - **SOLID Principles**:\n     - **Single Responsibility Principle**: A class should have only one reason to change.\n     - **Interface Segregation Principle**: Clients should not be forced to depend on methods they do not use.\n     - **Open-Closed Principle**: Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.\n     - **Liskov Substitution Principle**: Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without breaking the application.\n     - **Dependency Inversion Principle**: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.\n   - **Design Patterns**:\n     - **Facade Pattern**: Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.\n     - **Adapter Pattern**: Allows incompatible interfaces to work together.\n     - **Builder Pattern**: Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation.\n     - **Strategy Pattern**: Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.\n\n4. **Software Quality Attributes**\n   - **Learnability**: Ease with which new users can begin effective interaction and achieve maximal performance.\n   - **Efficiency**: Optimizing resource usage (e.g., memory, processing power).\n   - **Maintainability**: Ease with which a software system can be modified to correct faults, improve performance, or adapt to a changed environment.\n   - **Understandability**: Ease with which the software can be understood by developers and users.\n\n5. **Software Prototyping**\n   - **Types of Prototypes**: Storyboard, paper prototype, digital mock-up, interactive prototype.\n\n6. **Software Coupling and Cohesion**\n   - **Coupling**: Degree of interdependence between software modules.\n     - **Control Coupling**: When one module controls the flow of another module.\n     - **Content Coupling**: When one module directly modifies or relies on the internal workings of another module.\n     - **Data Coupling**: When modules share data through parameters.\n     - **Common Coupling**: When modules share a common data area.\n   - **Cohesion**: Degree to which the elements inside a module belong together.\n\n7. **Software Metrics**\n   - **Cyclomatic Complexity**: Measures the complexity of a program by counting the number of linearly independent paths through the program's source code.\n     - Formula: \\( \\text{Cyclomatic Complexity} = E - N + 2P \\), where \\( E \\) is the number of edges, \\( N \\) is the number of nodes, and \\( P \\) is the number of connected components.\n\n8. **Software Architectures**\n   - **Client-Server Architecture**: A distributed application structure that partitions tasks or workloads between providers of a resource or service (servers) and service requesters (clients).\n   - **Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Architecture**: A distributed application architecture that partitions tasks or workloads between peers, which are equally privileged participants in the application.\n   - **Model-View-Controller (MVC)**: A software architectural pattern for implementing user interfaces, data, and controlling logic.\n\n9. **Software Risk Management**\n   - **Risk Categories**: Business risk, technical risk, project risk, legal risk.\n   - **Risk Mitigation**: Strategies to reduce the impact or likelihood of risks, such as benchmarking, regular inspections, and avoiding high-risk components.\n\n10. **Software Effort Estimation**\n    - **COCOMO Model**: Constructive Cost Model for estimating the effort required to develop software.\n      - Formula: \\( \\text{Effort} = a \\times (\\text{Size})^b \\times \\prod_{i=1}^{n} \\text{EM}_i \\), where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are constants, \\( \\text{Size} \\) is the project size in KLOC, and \\( \\text{EM}_i \\) are effort multipliers for cost drivers.\n\n#### Mermaid Knowledge Graph\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[Software Engineering] --> B[Software Development Methodologies];\n    A --> C[Requirements Analysis];\n    A --> D[Software Design Principles];\n    A --> E[Software Quality Attributes];\n    A --> F[Software Prototyping];\n    A --> G[Software Coupling and Cohesion];\n    A --> H[Software Metrics];\n    A --> I[Software Architectures];\n    A --> J[Software Risk Management];\n    A --> K[Software Effort Estimation];\n\n    B --> B1[Agile Methodology];\n    B --> B2[Waterfall Model];\n\n    C --> C1[Gathering Techniques];\n    C --> C2[Types of Requirements];\n    C --> C3[SMART Criteria];\n\n    D --> D1[SOLID Principles];\n    D --> D2[Design Patterns];\n\n    E --> E1[Learnability];\n    E --> E2[Efficiency];\n    E --> E3[Maintainability];\n    E --> E4[Understandability];\n\n    F --> F1[Storyboard];\n    F --> F2[Paper Prototype];\n    F --> F3[Digital Mock-up];\n    F --> F4[Interactive Prototype];\n\n    G --> G1[Control Coupling];\n    G --> G2[Content Coupling];\n    G --> G3[Data Coupling];\n    G --> G4[Common Coupling];\n\n    H --> H1[Cyclomatic Complexity];\n\n    I --> I1[Client-Server Architecture];\n    I --> I2[Peer-to-Peer Architecture];\n    I --> I3[Model-View-Controller];\n\n    J --> J1[Risk Categories];\n    J --> J2[Risk Mitigation];\n\n    K --> K1[COCOMO Model];\n```\n\nThis summary and knowledge graph should help you focus on the essential topics, concepts, principles, and equations for your exam preparation.",
