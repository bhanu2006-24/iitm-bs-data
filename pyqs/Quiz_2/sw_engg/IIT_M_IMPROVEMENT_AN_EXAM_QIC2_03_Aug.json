Here is a summary of the core topics, concepts, principles, and equations that are essential to study for the exam:\n\n#### 1. **Software Development Methodologies**\n- **Agile Methodology**: Principles such as customer collaboration, responding to change, and working software.\n- **Waterfall Model**: Sequential process with distinct phases.\n- **Spiral Model**: Iterative development with risk assessment.\n- **Prototype Model**: Building prototypes for early feedback.\n\n#### 2. **Requirements Engineering**\n- **Requirements Gathering Techniques**: Interviews, focus groups, documentation, and observation.\n- **Requirements Analysis**: Understanding and documenting user needs.\n- **SMART Criteria**: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound.\n- **User Stories**: Descriptions of features from the user's perspective.\n\n#### 3. **Software Design Principles**\n- **SOLID Principles**:\n  - **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: A class should have only one reason to change.\n  - **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**: Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.\n  - **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**: Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.\n  - **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**: Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.\n  - **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules.\n- **Design Patterns**:\n  - **Facade Pattern**: Providing a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.\n  - **Adapter Pattern**: Converting the interface of a class into another interface clients expect.\n  - **Builder Pattern**: Separating the construction of a complex object from its representation.\n  - **Strategy Pattern**: Defining a family of algorithms, encapsulating each one, and making them interchangeable.\n\n#### 4. **Software Architecture**\n- **Architectural Styles**: Client-Server, Peer-to-Peer (P2P), Model-View-Controller (MVC), Pipe and Filter.\n- **Coupling and Cohesion**: Types of coupling (control, data, common) and their impact on software design.\n\n#### 5. **Software Prototyping**\n- **Types of Prototypes**: Storyboard, paper prototype, digital mock-up, interactive prototype.\n\n#### 6. **Software Testing and Debugging**\n- **Debugging Techniques**: Black box debugging, step-by-step debugging, dump and diff comparison.\n- **Cyclomatic Complexity**: Measuring the complexity of a program by counting the number of linearly independent paths.\n\n#### 7. **Software Quality Attributes**\n- **Learnability**: Features that improve the ease of learning a system.\n- **Efficiency**: Optimizing resource usage.\n- **Maintainability**: Ease of maintaining and updating software.\n- **Understandability**: Ease of understanding the software.\n\n#### 8. **Software Metrics and Estimation**\n- **COCOMO Model**: Constructive Cost Model for estimating software development effort.\n  - **Organic Project**: \\( E = a \\times (KLOC)^b \\)\n  - **Semi-detached Project**: \\( E = a \\times (KLOC)^b \\)\n  - **Embedded Project**: \\( E = a \\times (KLOC)^b \\)\n  - Where \\( E \\) is the effort in person-months, \\( KLOC \\) is the estimated size in thousands of lines of code, and \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are constants.\n\n#### 9. **Risk Management**\n- **Risk Categories**: Business risk, technical risk, project risk, legal risk.\n- **Risk Mitigation**: Strategies to reduce the impact of risks, such as regular inspections and benchmarking.\n\n#### 10. **Stakeholder Analysis**\n- **Stakeholder Categories**: Primary, secondary, and tertiary users.\n- **Stakeholder Identification**: Understanding the roles and needs of different stakeholders.\n\n### Knowledge Graph \n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[Software Engineering] --> B[Software Development Methodologies];\n    A --> C[Requirements Engineering];\n    A --> D[Software Design Principles];\n    A --> E[Software Architecture];\n    A --> F[Software Prototyping];\n    A --> G[Software Testing and Debugging];\n    A --> H[Software Quality Attributes];\n    A --> I[Software Metrics and Estimation];\n    A --> J[Risk Management];\n    A --> K[Stakeholder Analysis];\n\n    B --> B1[Agile Methodology];\n    B --> B2[Waterfall Model];\n    B --> B3[Spiral Model];\n    B --> B4[Prototype Model];\n\n    C --> C1[Requirements Gathering Techniques];\n    C --> C2[Requirements Analysis];\n    C --> C3[SMART Criteria];\n    C --> C4[User Stories];\n\n    D --> D1[SOLID Principles];\n    D --> D2[Design Patterns];\n\n    E --> E1[Architectural Styles];\n    E --> E2[Coupling and Cohesion];\n\n    F --> F1[Types of Prototypes];\n\n    G --> G1[Debugging Techniques];\n    G --> G2[Cyclomatic Complexity];\n\n    H --> H1[Learnability];\n    H --> H2[Efficiency];\n    H --> H3[Maintainability];\n    H --> H4[Understandability];\n\n    I --> I1[COCOMO Model];\n\n    J --> J1[Risk Categories];\n    J --> J2[Risk Mitigation];\n\n    K --> K1[Stakeholder Categories];\n    K --> K2[Stakeholder Identification];\n```\n\nThis knowledge graph visually maps the relationships between the core topics in Software Engineering, providing a clear and easy-to-understand overview of the subject.",
