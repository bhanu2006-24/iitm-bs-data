**Waterfall Model**: Sequential development process with distinct phases.\n   - **Spiral Model**: Combines iterative development with systematic aspects of the waterfall model.\n   - **Prototype Model**: Involves creating prototypes early in the development process.\n\n2. **Requirements Analysis**\n   - **User Stories**: Descriptions of a software feature from an end-user perspective.\n   - **SMART Criteria**: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound.\n   - **Stakeholder Analysis**: Identifying and categorizing stakeholders (Primary, Secondary, Tertiary).\n   - **Requirement Gathering Techniques**: Documentation, Interviews, Focus Groups, Observation.\n\n3. **Software Design Principles**\n   - **SOLID Principles**:\n     - **Single Responsibility Principle**: A class should have only one reason to change.\n     - **Interface Segregation Principle**: Clients should not be forced to depend on methods they do not use.\n     - **Open-Closed Principle**: Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.\n     - **Liskov Substitution Principle**: Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without breaking the application.\n     - **Dependency Inversion Principle**: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules but on abstractions.\n   - **Design Patterns**:\n     - **Facade Pattern**: Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.\n     - **Adapter Pattern**: Allows incompatible interfaces to work together.\n     - **Builder Pattern**: Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation.\n     - **Strategy Pattern**: Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.\n\n4. **Software Quality Attributes**\n   - **Efficiency**: Optimizing resource usage.\n   - **Maintainability**: Ease of maintaining and updating the software.\n   - **Understandability**: Ease of understanding the software.\n   - **Scalability**: Ability to handle growth.\n\n5. **Coupling and Cohesion**\n   - **Coupling**: Degree of interdependence between software modules.\n     - **Control Coupling**: When one module controls the flow of another module.\n     - **Content Coupling**: When one module directly modifies or relies on the internal workings of another module.\n     - **Data Coupling**: When modules share data through parameters.\n     - **Common Coupling**: When modules share a common data area.\n   - **Cohesion**: Degree to which elements within a module belong together.\n\n6. **Prototyping**\n   - **Storyboard**: Visual representation of the user interface.\n   - **Paper Prototype**: Hand-drawn sketches of the user interface.\n   - **Digital Mock-up**: Digital representation of the user interface.\n   - **Interactive Prototype**: Functional prototype that allows user interaction.\n\n7. **Debugging Techniques**\n   - **Black Box Debugging**: Debugging without knowledge of the internal workings of the system.\n   - **White Box Debugging**: Debugging with knowledge of the internal workings of the system.\n   - **Step Debugging**: Executing code step by step to identify issues.\n   - **Dump and Diff Comparison**: Comparing outputs to identify differences.\n\n8. **Software Metrics**\n   - **Cyclomatic Complexity**: Measure of the complexity of a program based on the number of linearly independent paths.\n     - **Formula**: \\( V(G) = E - N + 2P \\) where \\( E \\) is the number of edges, \\( N \\) is the number of nodes, and \\( P \\) is the number of connected components.\n   - **COCOMO Model**: Constructive Cost Model for estimating software development effort.\n     - **Basic COCOMO Formula**: \\( E = a \\times (KLOC)^b \\) where \\( E \\) is the effort in person-months, \\( KLOC \\) is the size of the project in thousands of lines of code, and \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are constants.\n     - **Intermediate COCOMO Formula**: \\( E = a \\times (KLOC)^b \\times EAF \\) where \\( EAF \\) is the Effort Adjustment Factor based on cost drivers.\n\n9. **Risk Management**\n   - **Technical Risk**: Risks related to the technical aspects of the project.\n   - **Business Risk**: Risks related to the business aspects of the project.\n   - **Project Risk**: Risks related to the project management aspects.\n   - **Legal Risk**: Risks related to legal aspects of the project.\n\n10. **Software Architecture**\n    - **Client-Server Architecture**: Separates the client and server components.\n    - **Model-View-Controller (MVC)**: Separates the application into three interconnected components.\n    - **Pipe and Filter Architecture**: Processes data through a series of filters.\n    - **Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Architecture**: Decentralized architecture where each node has equal responsibilities.\n\n#### Mermaid Knowledge Graph\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Software Engineering] --> B[Development Methodologies]\n    A --> C[Requirements Analysis]\n    A --> D[Software Design Principles]\n    A --> E[Software Quality Attributes]\n    A --> F[Coupling and Cohesion]\n    A --> G[Prototyping]\n    A --> H[Debugging Techniques]\n    A --> I[Software Metrics]\n    A --> J[Risk Management]\n    A --> K[Software Architecture]\n\n    B --> B1[Agile]\n    B --> B2[Waterfall]\n    B --> B3[Spiral]\n    B --> B4[Prototype]\n\n    C --> C1[User Stories]\n    C --> C2[SMART Criteria]\n    C --> C3[Stakeholder Analysis]\n    C --> C4[Requirement Gathering Techniques]\n\n    D --> D1[SOLID Principles]\n    D --> D2[Design Patterns]\n\n    D1 --> D1a[Single Responsibility Principle]\n    D1 --> D1b[Interface Segregation Principle]\n    D1 --> D1c[Open-Closed Principle]\n    D1 --> D1d[Liskov Substitution Principle]\n    D1 --> D1e[Dependency Inversion Principle]\n\n    D2 --> D2a[Facade Pattern]\n    D2 --> D2b[Adapter Pattern]\n    D2 --> D2c[Builder Pattern]\n    D2 --> D2d[Strategy Pattern]\n\n    E --> E1[Efficiency]\n    E --> E2[Maintainability]\n    E --> E3[Understandability]\n    E --> E4[Scalability]\n\n    F --> F1[Control Coupling]\n    F --> F2[Content Coupling]\n    F --> F3[Data Coupling]\n    F --> F4[Common Coupling]\n\n    G --> G1[Storyboard]\n    G --> G2[Paper Prototype]\n    G --> G3[Digital Mock-up]\n    G --> G4[Interactive Prototype]\n\n    H --> H1[Black Box Debugging]\n    H --> H2[White Box Debugging]\n    H --> H3[Step Debugging]\n    H --> H4[Dump and Diff Comparison]\n\n    I --> I1[Cyclomatic Complexity]\n    I --> I2[COCOMO Model]\n\n    J --> J1[Technical Risk]\n    J --> J2[Business Risk]\n    J --> J3[Project Risk]\n    J --> J4[Legal Risk]\n\n    K --> K1[Client-Server Architecture]\n    K --> K2[Model-View-Controller]\n    K --> K3[Pipe and Filter Architecture]\n    K --> K4[Peer-to-Peer Architecture]\n```\n\nThis summary and knowledge graph should help you understand the core topics, concepts, principles, and equations essential for the exam.",
