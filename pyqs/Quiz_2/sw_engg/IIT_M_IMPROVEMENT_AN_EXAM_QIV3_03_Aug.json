The basic formula is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Effort} = a \\times (\\text{KLOC})^b \\times \\prod_{i=1}^{n} \\text{Multiplier}_i \\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( \\text{Effort} \\) is the estimated effort in person-months.\n- \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are constants that depend on the type of project (Organic, Semi-detached, Embedded).\n- \\( \\text{KLOC} \\) is the estimated size of the project in thousands of lines of code.\n- \\( \\text{Multiplier}_i \\) are cost drivers that adjust the effort based on various factors.\n\n### Knowledge Graph \n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[Software Development Lifecycle] --> B[Requirements Analysis]\n    A --> C[Prototyping]\n    A --> D[Development Models]\n    A --> E[Stakeholder Categorization]\n    F[Software Design Principles] --> G[Design Quality Attributes]\n    F --> H[Coupling and Cohesion]\n    F --> I[Design Patterns]\n    F --> J[SOLID Principles]\n    K[Software Testing and Debugging] --> L[Debugging Techniques]\n    K --> M[Risk Management]\n    N[Software Architecture] --> O[Architectural Styles]\n    N --> P[Interface Design]\n    Q[Project Management] --> R[Agile Practices]\n    Q --> S[Effort Estimation]\n    T[User Experience Design] --> U[Learnability]\n```\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    B[Requirements Analysis] --> BA[Stakeholder Needs]\n    B --> BB[Documentation]\n    C[Prototyping] --> CA[Digital Mock-ups]\n    C --> CB[Storyboards]\n    D[Development Models] --> DA[Waterfall]\n    D --> DB[Agile]\n    D --> DC[Spiral]\n    D --> DD[Prototype]\n    E[Stakeholder Categorization] --> EA[Primary Users]\n    E --> EB[Secondary Users]\n    E --> EC[Tertiary Users]\n    G[Design Quality Attributes] --> GA[Efficiency]\n    G --> GB[Maintainability]\n    G --> GC[Understandability]\n    G --> GD[Scalability]\n    H[Coupling and Cohesion] --> HA[Control Coupling]\n    H --> HB[Data Coupling]\n    H --> HC[Common Coupling]\n    I[Design Patterns] --> IA[Builder]\n    I --> IB[Adapter]\n    I --> IC[Facade]\n    I --> ID[Strategy]\n    J[SOLID Principles] --> JA[Single Responsibility]\n    J --> JB[Open-Closed]\n    J --> JC[Liskov Substitution]\n    J --> JD[Interface Segregation]\n    J --> JE[Dependency Inversion]\n    L[Debugging Techniques] --> LA[Black Box Debugging]\n    L --> LB[Using Documentation]\n    M[Risk Management] --> MA[Technical Risks]\n    M --> MB[Mitigation Strategies]\n    O[Architectural Styles] --> OA[Client-Server]\n    O --> OB[MVC]\n    O --> OC[Pipe and Filter]\n    O --> OD[Peer-to-Peer]\n    P[Interface Design] --> PA[Clear Interfaces]\n    P --> PB[Component Communication]\n    R[Agile Practices] --> RA[Scrum]\n    R --> RB[Velocity Estimation]\n    R --> RC[User Stories]\n    S[Effort Estimation] --> SA[COCOMO Model]\n    U[Learnability] --> UA[Step-by-Step Wizards]\n    U --> UB[Templates]\n```\n\nThis summary and knowledge graph should help you focus on the essential topics and concepts for your exam preparation.",
