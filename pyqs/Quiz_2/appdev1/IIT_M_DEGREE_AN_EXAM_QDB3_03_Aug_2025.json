        "summary": "### Summary of Core Topics, Concepts, Principles, and Equations\n\n#### 1. **Modern Application Development**\n- **Scaling Strategies**: Understanding when to scale up (vertical scaling) vs. scale out (horizontal scaling).\n  - **Scale Up**: Increasing the capacity of a single server.\n  - **Scale Out**: Adding more servers to distribute the load.\n- **Server-Side Rendering vs. Client-Side Rendering**:\n  - **Jinja2 (Server-Side)**: Faster initial page load, better SEO.\n  - **JavaScript/JSON (Client-Side)**: Dynamic updates, reduced server load.\n\n#### 2. **Database Management with SQLAlchemy**\n- **Querying Data**: Using SQLAlchemy to query and manipulate data.\n  - **Example**: `db.session.query(GlassRepair).all()`\n  - **Filtering**: `GlassRepair.query.filter_by(status='fixed')`\n  - **Date Arithmetic**: Calculating differences between dates.\n    - **Example**: `(r.fixed_at - r.broken_at).days`\n\n#### 3. **Flask and Web Development**\n- **Routing and Templates**: Using Flask to route URLs and render templates.\n  - **Example**:\n    ```python\n    @app.route(\"/text/size/<int:size>/<color>\")\n    def set_size(size, color):\n        style = {\"font-size\": str(size) + \"px\", \"color\": color}\n        return render_template(\"index.html\", css_style=style)\n    ```\n- **Handling Requests**: Using `request.args` to handle query parameters.\n  - **Example**:\n    ```python\n    args = request.args\n    if vu[\"uid\"] == args[\"uid\"] and vu[\"pwd\"] == args[\"pwd\"]:\n        return \"You are authorized!!\"\n    ```\n\n#### 4. **JavaScript and HTML**\n- **Including External JavaScript**: Using `<script src=\"jsfile.js\"></script>`.\n- **Event Handling**: Using `onclick` to handle button clicks.\n  - **Example**: `<button onclick=\"alert('Hello, welcome')\">Greet1!</button>`\n\n#### 5. **REST APIs and Caching**\n- **Caching**: Improves performance by storing responses.\n  - **Advantages**: Reduces server load, improves latency.\n  - **Disadvantages**: Can degrade quality of service if not managed properly.\n- **Curl Commands**: Using `curl` to interact with REST APIs.\n  - **Example**:\n    ```bash\n    curl -X POST \"http://127.0.0.1:5000\" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{\"val1\":27,\"val2\":3,\"operator\":\"+\"}'\n    ```\n\n#### 6. **Data Structures and Algorithms**\n- **Graphs**: Storing data in graphs, including attributes like node degree and edge weights.\n  - **Applications**: Social networks, path finding.\n\n#### 7. **Mathematics and Information Theory**\n- **Character Encoding**: Calculating the number of bits required to represent characters.\n  - **Example**: For a character set of size \\( n \\), the number of bits required is \\( \\log_2(n) \\).\n\n### Knowledge Graph \n\n#### Graph 1: Modern Application Development\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[Modern Application Development] --> B[Scaling Strategies];\n    A --> C[Server-Side Rendering];\n    A --> D[Client-Side Rendering];\n    B --> E[Scale Up];\n    B --> F[Scale Out];\n    C --> G[Jinja2];\n    D --> H[JavaScript/JSON];\n```\n\n#### Graph 2: Database Management with SQLAlchemy\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    I[Database Management] --> J[SQLAlchemy];\n    J --> K[Querying Data];\n    J --> L[Filtering Data];\n    J --> M[Date Arithmetic];\n    K --> N[db.session.query];\n    L --> O[filter_by];\n    M --> P[(r.fixed_at - r.broken_at).days];\n```\n\n#### Graph 3: Flask and Web Development\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    Q[Flask and Web Development] --> R[Routing];\n    Q --> S[Templates];\n    Q --> T[Handling Requests];\n    R --> U[@app.route];\n    S --> V[render_template];\n    T --> W[request.args];\n```\n\n#### Graph 4: JavaScript and HTML\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    X[JavaScript and HTML] --> Y[Including External JavaScript];\n    X --> Z[Event Handling];\n    Y --> AA[<script src=\"jsfile.js\">];\n    Z --> AB[onclick];\n```\n\n#### Graph 5: REST APIs and Caching\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    AC[REST APIs and Caching] --> AD[Caching];\n    AC --> AE[Curl Commands];\n    AD --> AF[Advantages];\n    AD --> AG[Disadvantages];\n    AE --> AH[curl -X POST];\n```\n\n#### Graph 6: Data Structures and Algorithms\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    AI[Data Structures and Algorithms] --> AJ[Graphs];\n    AJ --> AK[Node Degree];\n    AJ --> AL[Edge Weights];\n    AJ --> AM[Path Finding];\n```\n\n#### Graph 7: Mathematics and Information Theory\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    AN[Mathematics and Information Theory] --> AO[Character Encoding];\n    AO --> AP[Number of Bits];\n    AP --> AQ[log2(n)];\n```\n\nThese graphs and summaries should help you understand the core topics and their relationships for the exam.",
