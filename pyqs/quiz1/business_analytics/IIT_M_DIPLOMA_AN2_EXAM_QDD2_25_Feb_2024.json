The previous year admissions indicate that 20% of the total applications are Procrastinators, 40% are Mobile Gamers and the rest are TV Watchers.  When examining past applications submitted by the three professional categories, it is seen that the applications are either \u201cFully Completed\u201d, \u201cHalf Completed\u201d or \u201cBlank\u201d.
