Data Visualization\n- **Pie Charts**: Best for showing proportions in data.\n- **Histograms**: Useful for showing distributions and identifying skewness.\n\n#### 2. Statistical Distributions\n- **Symmetric Distributions**:\n  - Standard Normal Distribution\n  - Standard Binomial Distribution\n  - Uniform Distribution\n- **Skewness**:\n  - Positive Skewness: Right-tailed distribution.\n  - Negative Skewness: Left-tailed distribution.\n\n#### 3. Hypothesis Testing\n- **Chi-Square Test**: Used for testing independence and goodness of fit.\n  - **Test Statistic**: Measures the discrepancy between observed and expected frequencies.\n  - **Degrees of Freedom**: Calculated based on the number of categories.\n  - **p-value**: Probability of observing the sample given the null hypothesis.\n  - **Significance Level**: Threshold for rejecting the null hypothesis.\n\n#### 4. Linear Demand Response Curve\n- **Market Size**: Total potential demand.\n- **Elasticity**: Measures the responsiveness of demand to price changes.\n  - Formula: \\( E = \\frac{\\% \\text{ change in quantity demanded}}{\\% \\text{ change in price}} \\)\n- **Satiating Price**: Price at which demand becomes perfectly elastic.\n\n#### 5. Probability and Bayes' Theorem\n- **Conditional Probability**: Probability of an event given another event.\n- **Bayes' Theorem**: Updates the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence.\n  - Formula: \\( P(A|B) = \\frac{P(B|A) \\cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \\)\n\n### Equations\n\n#### Chi-Square Test Statistic\n\\[ \\chi^2 = \\sum \\frac{(O_i - E_i)^2}{E_i} \\]\nwhere \\( O_i \\) is the observed frequency and \\( E_i \\) is the expected frequency.\n\n#### Degrees of Freedom for Chi-Square Test\nFor a goodness of fit test:\n\\[ \\text{df} = n - 1 \\]\nwhere \\( n \\) is the number of categories.\n\nFor a test of independence:\n\\[ \\text{df} = (r - 1)(c - 1) \\]\nwhere \\( r \\) is the number of rows and \\( c \\) is the number of columns.\n\n#### Elasticity of Demand\n\\[ E = \\frac{\\% \\text{ change in quantity demanded}}{\\% \\text{ change in price}} \\]\n\n#### Linear Demand Curve\n\\[ Q = a - bP \\]\nwhere \\( Q \\) is the quantity demanded, \\( P \\) is the price, \\( a \\) is the market size, and \\( b \\) is the slope of the demand curve.\n\n### Knowledge Graph \n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[Data Visualization] --> B[Pie Charts]\n    A --> C[Histograms]\n    D[Statistical Distributions] --> E[Symmetric Distributions]\n    D --> F[Skewness]\n    E --> G[Standard Normal Distribution]\n    E --> H[Standard Binomial Distribution]\n    E --> I[Uniform Distribution]\n    F --> J[Positive Skewness]\n    F --> K[Negative Skewness]\n    L[Hypothesis Testing] --> M[Chi-Square Test]\n    M --> N[Test Statistic]\n    M --> O[Degrees of Freedom]\n    M --> P[p-value]\n    M --> Q[Significance Level]\n    R[Linear Demand Response Curve] --> S[Market Size]\n    R --> T[Elasticity]\n    R --> U[Satiating Price]\n    V[Probability] --> W[Conditional Probability]\n    V --> X[Bayes' Theorem]\n```\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[Data Analysis] --> B[Descriptive Statistics]\n    A --> C[Inferential Statistics]\n    B --> D[Data Visualization]\n    B --> E[Statistical Distributions]\n    C --> F[Hypothesis Testing]\n    C --> G[Linear Demand Response Curve]\n    C --> H[Probability]\n    D --> I[Pie Charts]\n    D --> J[Histograms]\n    E --> K[Symmetric Distributions]\n    E --> L[Skewness]\n    F --> M[Chi-Square Test]\n    G --> N[Market Size]\n    G --> O[Elasticity]\n    G --> P[Satiating Price]\n    H --> Q[Conditional Probability]\n    H --> R[Bayes' Theorem]\n```\n\nThese graphs provide a visual representation of the relationships between the core topics, concepts, and principles essential for the exam.",
