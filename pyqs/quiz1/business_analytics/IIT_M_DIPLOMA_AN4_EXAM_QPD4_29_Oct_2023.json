Data Visualization\n- **Pie Chart**: Best used to show proportions in data.\n- **Other Visualizations**: Bar charts for trends, scatter plots for relationships, etc.\n\n#### 2. Statistical Distributions\n- **Symmetric Distributions**:\n  - Standard Normal Distribution\n  - Standard Binomial Distribution\n  - Uniform Distribution\n- **Non-Symmetric Distributions**:\n  - Poisson Distribution\n\n#### 3. Hypothesis Testing\n- **Chi-Square Test**: Used to validate claims about distributions.\n  - **Expected Value**: Calculated based on the uniform distribution.\n  - **Test Statistic**: Measures the deviation of observed values from expected values.\n  - **Degrees of Freedom**: Number of categories minus one.\n  - **p-value**: Probability of observing the sample given the null hypothesis.\n  - **Significance Level**: Threshold for rejecting the null hypothesis.\n\n#### 4. Independence Testing\n- **Chi-Square Test for Independence**: Used to test if two categorical variables are independent.\n  - **Test Statistic**: Measures the association between the variables.\n  - **Degrees of Freedom**: (Number of rows - 1) * (Number of columns - 1).\n  - **Interpretation of p-value**: Determines if the variables are independent.\n\n#### 5. Demand and Elasticity\n- **Linear Demand Curve**: Relationship between price and quantity demanded.\n  - **Market Size**: Total potential demand.\n  - **Elasticity**: Measures the responsiveness of demand to price changes.\n  - **Satiating Price**: Price at which demand becomes perfectly elastic.\n\n#### 6. Probability and Bayes' Theorem\n- **Mutually Exclusive Events**: Events that cannot occur simultaneously.\n- **Conditional Probability**: Probability of an event given another event.\n- **Bayes' Theorem**: Used to update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence.\n\n### Equations\n\n#### Chi-Square Test Statistic\n\\[ \\chi^2 = \\sum \\frac{(O_i - E_i)^2}{E_i} \\]\nwhere \\( O_i \\) is the observed frequency and \\( E_i \\) is the expected frequency.\n\n#### Degrees of Freedom for Chi-Square Test\n\\[ df = n - 1 \\]\nwhere \\( n \\) is the number of categories.\n\n#### Degrees of Freedom for Chi-Square Test of Independence\n\\[ df = (r - 1)(c - 1) \\]\nwhere \\( r \\) is the number of rows and \\( c \\) is the number of columns.\n\n#### Linear Demand Curve\n\\[ Q = a - bP \\]\nwhere \\( Q \\) is the quantity demanded, \\( P \\) is the price, \\( a \\) is the market size, and \\( b \\) is the slope of the demand curve.\n\n#### Price Elasticity of Demand\n\\[ E_d = \\frac{\\% \\Delta Q}{\\% \\Delta P} \\]\nwhere \\( E_d \\) is the elasticity, \\( \\% \\Delta Q \\) is the percentage change in quantity demanded, and \\( \\% \\Delta P \\) is the percentage change in price.\n\n#### Bayes' Theorem\n\\[ P(A|B) = \\frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} \\]\nwhere \\( P(A|B) \\) is the probability of event A given event B, \\( P(B|A) \\) is the probability of event B given event A, \\( P(A) \\) is the probability of event A, and \\( P(B) \\) is the probability of event B.\n\n### Knowledge Graph \n\n#### Graph 1: Data Visualization and Statistical Distributions\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    DataVisualization-->PieChart\n    DataVisualization-->BarChart\n    DataVisualization-->ScatterPlot\n    StatisticalDistributions-->SymmetricDistributions\n    StatisticalDistributions-->NonSymmetricDistributions\n    SymmetricDistributions-->StandardNormalDistribution\n    SymmetricDistributions-->StandardBinomialDistribution\n    SymmetricDistributions-->UniformDistribution\n    NonSymmetricDistributions-->PoissonDistribution\n```\n\n#### Graph 2: Hypothesis Testing\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    HypothesisTesting-->ChiSquareTest\n    ChiSquareTest-->ExpectedValue\n    ChiSquareTest-->TestStatistic\n    ChiSquareTest-->DegreesOfFreedom\n    ChiSquareTest-->pvalue\n    ChiSquareTest-->SignificanceLevel\n```\n\n#### Graph 3: Independence Testing\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    IndependenceTesting-->ChiSquareTestForIndependence\n    ChiSquareTestForIndependence-->TestStatistic\n    ChiSquareTestForIndependence-->DegreesOfFreedom\n    ChiSquareTestForIndependence-->pvalueInterpretation\n```\n\n#### Graph 4: Demand and Elasticity\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    DemandAndElasticity-->LinearDemandCurve\n    LinearDemandCurve-->MarketSize\n    LinearDemandCurve-->Elasticity\n    LinearDemandCurve-->SatiatingPrice\n```\n\n#### Graph 5: Probability and Bayes' Theorem\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    Probability-->MutuallyExclusiveEvents\n    Probability-->ConditionalProbability\n    Probability-->BayesTheorem\n```\n\nThese graphs provide a visual representation of the relationships between the core topics, concepts, and principles essential for the exam.",
