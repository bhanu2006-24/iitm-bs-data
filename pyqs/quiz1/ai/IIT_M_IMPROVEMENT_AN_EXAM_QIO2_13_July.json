State Space Search\n- **State Representation**: Represented as a three-digit number \"abc\" where a, b, and c indicate the number of shells in cups A, B, and C.\n- **Move Generation**: Involves selecting a non-empty cup, removing all shells, and distributing them in a round-robin manner.\n- **Valid Move**: A move is valid if the first digit of the output state is greater than or equal to the first digit of the input state.\n- **Heuristic Function**: h(abc) = a + b, which returns the number of shells in the first two cups.\n- **Search Algorithms**: Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), and Best-First Search (BFS) are used to navigate the state space.\n\n#### 2. Genetic Algorithms\n- **Constructive Methods**: Include Greedy Heuristic, Nearest Neighbour Heuristic, and Savings Heuristic.\n- **Tour Representations**: Path representation, adjacency representation, and ordinal representation.\n- **Crossover Methods**: Midpoint crossover for generating offspring in genetic algorithms.\n\n#### 3. Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)\n- **Distance Matrix**: Represents the distances between cities.\n- **Heuristics for TSP**:\n  - **Nearest Neighbour Heuristic**: Constructs a tour by repeatedly visiting the nearest unvisited city.\n  - **Greedy Heuristic**: Constructs a tour by selecting the shortest available edge at each step.\n  - **Savings Heuristic**: Constructs a tour by calculating savings for pairs of cities and merging routes based on savings.\n\n#### 4. Equations and Heuristics\n- **Heuristic Function**: h(abc) = a + b\n- **Savings Calculation**: Savings for a pair of cities (i, j) is calculated as the difference between the cost of going directly from the base city to each city and the cost of going from the base city to one city and then to the other.\n\n### Knowledge Graph \n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[State Space Search] --> B[State Representation];\n    A --> C[Move Generation];\n    A --> D[Valid Move];\n    A --> E[Heuristic Function];\n    A --> F[Search Algorithms];\n    B --> G[abc Format];\n    C --> H[Round-Robin Distribution];\n    D --> I[First Digit Comparison];\n    E --> J[h(abc) = a + b];\n    F --> K[DFS];\n    F --> L[BFS];\n    F --> M[Best-First Search];\n\n    N[Genetic Algorithms] --> O[Constructive Methods];\n    N --> P[Tour Representations];\n    N --> Q[Crossover Methods];\n    O --> R[Greedy Heuristic];\n    O --> S[Nearest Neighbour Heuristic];\n    O --> T[Savings Heuristic];\n    P --> U[Path Representation];\n    P --> V[Adjacency Representation];\n    P --> W[Ordinal Representation];\n    Q --> X[Midpoint Crossover];\n\n    Y[TSP] --> Z[Distance Matrix];\n    Y --> AA[Nearest Neighbour Heuristic];\n    Y --> AB[Greedy Heuristic];\n    Y --> AC[Savings Heuristic];\n    Z --> AD[City Distances];\n    AA --> AE[Nearest City Selection];\n    AB --> AF[Shortest Edge Selection];\n    AC --> AG[Savings Calculation];\n```\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[State Space Search] --> B[State Representation];\n    A --> C[Move Generation];\n    A --> D[Valid Move];\n    A --> E[Heuristic Function];\n    A --> F[Search Algorithms];\n    B --> G[abc Format];\n    C --> H[Round-Robin Distribution];\n    D --> I[First Digit Comparison];\n    E --> J[h(abc) = a + b];\n    F --> K[DFS];\n    F --> L[BFS];\n    F --> M[Best-First Search];\n\n    N[Genetic Algorithms] --> O[Constructive Methods];\n    N --> P[Tour Representations];\n    N --> Q[Crossover Methods];\n    O --> R[Greedy Heuristic];\n    O --> S[Nearest Neighbour Heuristic];\n    O --> T[Savings Heuristic];\n    P --> U[Path Representation];\n    P --> V[Adjacency Representation];\n    P --> W[Ordinal Representation];\n    Q --> X[Midpoint Crossover];\n\n    Y[TSP] --> Z[Distance Matrix];\n    Y --> AA[Nearest Neighbour Heuristic];\n    Y --> AB[Greedy Heuristic];\n    Y --> AC[Savings Heuristic];\n    Z --> AD[City Distances];\n    AA --> AE[Nearest City Selection];\n    AB --> AF[Shortest Edge Selection];\n    AC --> AG[Savings Calculation];\n```\n\nThis summary and knowledge graph should help you understand the core topics and their relationships for the exam.",
