        "summary": "### Summary of Core Topics and Concepts\n\nThe exam focuses on several key topics in AI, particularly search methods for problem-solving. Here is a summary of the core topics, concepts, principles, and equations that are essential to study for the exam:\n\n#### 1. State Space and State Space Graphs\n- **Concepts**: Understanding how to represent a problem as a state space, where each state represents a configuration of the problem.\n- **Principles**: Constructing state space graphs by identifying all reachable states from a start state and the transitions between them.\n- **Example**: The rabbits crossing puzzle, where states are represented as configurations of rabbits and the empty spot.\n\n#### 2. Search Algorithms\n- **Depth First Search (DFS)**:\n  - **Concepts**: Exploring as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.\n  - **Principles**: Uses a stack (LIFO) to keep track of nodes to visit.\n  - **Example**: Listing the first few nodes inspected by DFS in a given graph.\n\n- **Breadth First Search (BFS)**:\n  - **Concepts**: Exploring all neighbors at the present depth before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\n  - **Principles**: Uses a queue (FIFO) to keep track of nodes to visit.\n  - **Example**: Listing the first few nodes inspected by BFS in a given graph.\n\n- **Best First Search**:\n  - **Concepts**: Exploring nodes based on an evaluation function, often using a priority queue.\n  - **Principles**: Nodes are expanded based on their heuristic value.\n  - **Example**: Listing the first few nodes inspected by Best First Search in a given graph.\n\n- **Hill Climbing**:\n  - **Concepts**: Iteratively moving to the best neighboring state.\n  - **Principles**: Uses a heuristic to determine the best next state.\n  - **Example**: Listing the first few nodes inspected by Hill Climbing in a given graph.\n\n#### 3. Genetic Algorithms\n- **Concepts**: Using evolutionary principles to solve optimization problems.\n- **Principles**: Selection, crossover, and mutation to generate new solutions.\n- **Example**: Generating offspring using Partially Mapped Crossover (PMX).\n\n#### 4. Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)\n- **Concepts**: Finding the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city.\n- **Principles**: Using heuristics like Nearest Neighbor and Greedy algorithms to find approximate solutions.\n- **Example**: Constructing a tour using the Nearest Neighbor Heuristic or Greedy Heuristic.\n\n#### 5. Heuristics and Evaluation Functions\n- **Concepts**: Using heuristics to guide search algorithms.\n- **Principles**: Manhattan distance, savings in TSP, etc.\n- **Example**: Using Manhattan distance in search algorithms.\n\n### Equations\nFor the mathematical aspects, particularly in the context of TSP and heuristics, the following equations and concepts are important:\n\n1. **Manhattan Distance**:\n   \\[\n   d(p, q) = |p_x - q_x| + |p_y - q_y|\n   \\]\n   where \\( p \\) and \\( q \\) are points in a grid.\n\n2. **Savings in TSP**:\n   \\[\n   s_{ij} = c_{i0} + c_{0j} - c_{ij}\n   \\]\n   where \\( c_{i0} \\) is the cost from city \\( i \\) to the base city \\( 0 \\), and \\( c_{ij} \\) is the cost from city \\( i \\) to city \\( j \\).\n\n3. **Cost of a Tour**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} c_{i,i+1}\n   \\]\n   where \\( c_{i,i+1} \\) is the cost of traveling from city \\( i \\) to city \\( i+1 \\).\n\n### Knowledge Graph \n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[State Space] --> B[State Space Graphs];\n    A --> C[Search Algorithms];\n    C --> D[Depth First Search];\n    C --> E[Breadth First Search];\n    C --> F[Best First Search];\n    C --> G[Hill Climbing];\n    A --> H[Genetic Algorithms];\n    A --> I[Traveling Salesman Problem];\n    I --> J[Nearest Neighbor Heuristic];\n    I --> K[Greedy Heuristic];\n    I --> L[Savings Heuristic];\n    A --> M[Heuristics and Evaluation Functions];\n    M --> N[Manhattan Distance];\n```\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    B[State Space Graphs] --> O[Rabbits Crossing Puzzle];\n    D[Depth First Search] --> P[Node Inspection Order];\n    E[Breadth First Search] --> Q[Node Inspection Order];\n    F[Best First Search] --> R[Node Inspection Order];\n    G[Hill Climbing] --> S[Node Inspection Order];\n    H[Genetic Algorithms] --> T[Partially Mapped Crossover];\n    J[Nearest Neighbor Heuristic] --> U[Tour Construction];\n    K[Greedy Heuristic] --> V[Tour Construction];\n    L[Savings Heuristic] --> W[Tour Construction];\n    N[Manhattan Distance] --> X[Search Algorithms];\n```\n\nThese graphs visually map the relationships between the core topics, providing a clear and easy-to-understand overview of the subject matter.",
