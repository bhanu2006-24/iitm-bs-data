        "summary": "### Summary of Core Topics, Concepts, Principles, and Equations\n\n#### Core Topics and Concepts\n\n1. **State Space Search**\n   - **State Representation**: Represented by a three-digit number \"abc\" where a, b, and c indicate the number of shells in cups A, B, and C, respectively.\n   - **Move Generation**: A single move involves selecting a non-empty cup, removing all shells from that cup, and distributing them in a round-robin manner.\n   - **Valid Move**: A move is valid if the first digit of the output state is greater than or equal to the first digit of the input state.\n   - **Heuristic Function**: h(abc) = a + b, which returns the number of shells in the first two cups.\n\n2. **Search Algorithms**\n   - **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: Explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.\n   - **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Explores all neighbors at the present depth before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\n   - **Best-First Search**: Explores the most promising node chosen according to a specified rule.\n   - **Hill Climbing**: An iterative algorithm that starts with an arbitrary solution to a problem, then attempts to find a better solution by making an incremental change to the solution.\n\n3. **Genetic Algorithms**\n   - **Constructive Methods**: Algorithms that build a solution step by step, such as Greedy Heuristic, Nearest Neighbour Heuristic, and Savings Heuristic.\n   - **Tour Representations**: Different ways to represent a tour in the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), including path representation, adjacency representation, and ordinal representation.\n   - **Crossover Methods**: Techniques like single-point crossover and midpoint crossover used in genetic algorithms to combine the genetic information of two parents to generate new offspring.\n\n4. **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)**\n   - **Distance Matrix**: A matrix representing the distances between cities.\n   - **Heuristics for TSP**: Algorithms like Nearest Neighbour Heuristic, Greedy Heuristic, and Savings Heuristic used to find approximate solutions to the TSP.\n   - **Tour Cost Calculation**: The cost of a tour is the sum of the distances between consecutive cities in the tour.\n\n#### Important Equations\n\n1. **Heuristic Function**:\n   \\[\n   h(abc) = a + b\n   \\]\n   This heuristic function is used to evaluate the number of shells in the first two cups.\n\n2. **Savings Calculation**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Savings} = d_{i1} + d_{1j} - d_{ij}\n   \\]\n   This equation is used in the Savings Heuristic to calculate the savings for combining two routes.\n\n3. **Tour Cost**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Tour Cost} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} d_{c_i, c_{i+1}} + d_{c_n, c_1}\n   \\]\n   This equation calculates the total cost of a tour in the TSP, where \\(d_{c_i, c_{i+1}}\\) is the distance between city \\(c_i\\) and city \\(c_{i+1}\\).\n\n### Knowledge Graph \n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[State Space Search] --> B[State Representation];\n    A --> C[Move Generation];\n    A --> D[Valid Move];\n    A --> E[Heuristic Function];\n    B --> F[abc Representation];\n    C --> G[Round-Robin Distribution];\n    D --> H[First Digit Comparison];\n    E --> I[h(abc) = a + b];\n    A --> J[Search Algorithms];\n    J --> K[Depth-First Search];\n    J --> L[Breadth-First Search];\n    J --> M[Best-First Search];\n    J --> N[Hill Climbing];\n    A --> O[Genetic Algorithms];\n    O --> P[Constructive Methods];\n    O --> Q[Tour Representations];\n    O --> R[Crossover Methods];\n    P --> S[Greedy Heuristic];\n    P --> T[Nearest Neighbour Heuristic];\n    P --> U[Savings Heuristic];\n    Q --> V[Path Representation];\n    Q --> W[Adjacency Representation];\n    Q --> X[Ordinal Representation];\n    R --> Y[Single-Point Crossover];\n    R --> Z[Midpoint Crossover];\n    A --> AA[TSP];\n    AA --> AB[Distance Matrix];\n    AA --> AC[Heuristics for TSP];\n    AA --> AD[Tour Cost Calculation];\n    AC --> AE[Nearest Neighbour Heuristic];\n    AC --> AF[Greedy Heuristic];\n    AC --> AG[Savings Heuristic];\n    AD --> AH[Tour Cost Equation];\n```\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[State Space Search] --> B[State Representation];\n    A --> C[Move Generation];\n    A --> D[Valid Move];\n    A --> E[Heuristic Function];\n    B --> F[abc Representation];\n    C --> G[Round-Robin Distribution];\n    D --> H[First Digit Comparison];\n    E --> I[h(abc) = a + b];\n    A --> J[Search Algorithms];\n    J --> K[Depth-First Search];\n    J --> L[Breadth-First Search];\n    J --> M[Best-First Search];\n    J --> N[Hill Climbing];\n```\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[Genetic Algorithms] --> B[Constructive Methods];\n    A --> C[Tour Representations];\n    A --> D[Crossover Methods];\n    B --> E[Greedy Heuristic];\n    B --> F[Nearest Neighbour Heuristic];\n    B --> G[Savings Heuristic];\n    C --> H[Path Representation];\n    C --> I[Adjacency Representation];\n    C --> J[Ordinal Representation];\n    D --> K[Single-Point Crossover];\n    D --> L[Midpoint Crossover];\n```\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[TSP] --> B[Distance Matrix];\n    A --> C[Heuristics for TSP];\n    A --> D[Tour Cost Calculation];\n    C --> E[Nearest Neighbour Heuristic];\n    C --> F[Greedy Heuristic];\n    C --> G[Savings Heuristic];\n    D --> H[Tour Cost Equation];\n```\n\nThese graphs visually map the relationships between the core topics, concepts, and principles essential for the exam.",
