State Space and Search Algorithms\n- **State Space**: The set of all possible states that a system can be in. In the context of the rabbits crossing puzzle, the state space includes all possible configurations of the rabbits and the empty spot.\n- **State Space Graph**: A graph where nodes represent states and edges represent transitions between states.\n- **Search Algorithms**:\n  - **Depth First Search (DFS)**: Explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.\n  - **Breadth First Search (BFS)**: Explores all neighbors at the present depth before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\n  - **Best First Search**: Uses a priority queue to explore the most promising node first, often based on a heuristic.\n  - **Hill Climbing**: A local search algorithm that continually moves to the best neighboring state.\n\n#### 2. Genetic Algorithms\n- **Path Representation**: A way to represent a tour or path through a set of cities or nodes.\n- **Adjacency Representation**: A way to represent a tour or path based on the adjacency of nodes.\n- **Ordinal Representation**: A numerical representation of a path.\n- **Partially Mapped Crossover (PMX)**: A genetic operator used to combine two parent tours to produce offspring tours.\n\n#### 3. Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)\n- **Nearest Neighbor Heuristic**: Constructs a tour by starting at a city and repeatedly visiting the nearest unvisited city.\n- **Greedy Heuristic**: Constructs a tour by always choosing the next city with the smallest edge cost.\n- **Savings Algorithm**: A heuristic for constructing a tour by calculating the savings of combining pairs of cities.\n\n#### 4. Manhattan Distance\n- **Manhattan Distance**: A metric used to measure the distance between two points in a grid-based path. It is calculated as the sum of the absolute differences of their Cartesian coordinates.\n  \\[\n  \\text{Manhattan Distance} = |x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|\n  \\]\n\n### Knowledge Graph \n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[State Space] --> B[State Space Graph];\n    A --> C[Search Algorithms];\n    C --> D[Depth First Search];\n    C --> E[Breadth First Search];\n    C --> F[Best First Search];\n    C --> G[Hill Climbing];\n    A --> H[Genetic Algorithms];\n    H --> I[Path Representation];\n    H --> J[Adjacency Representation];\n    H --> K[Ordinal Representation];\n    H --> L[Partially Mapped Crossover];\n    A --> M[Traveling Salesman Problem];\n    M --> N[Nearest Neighbor Heuristic];\n    M --> O[Greedy Heuristic];\n    M --> P[Savings Algorithm];\n    A --> Q[Manhattan Distance];\n```\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    B[State Space Graph] --> R[Rabbits Crossing Puzzle];\n    D[Depth First Search] --> S[Graph Traversal];\n    E[Breadth First Search] --> S;\n    F[Best First Search] --> S;\n    G[Hill Climbing] --> S;\n    I[Path Representation] --> T[Genetic Algorithm Tour];\n    J[Adjacency Representation] --> T;\n    K[Ordinal Representation] --> T;\n    L[Partially Mapped Crossover] --> T;\n    N[Nearest Neighbor Heuristic] --> U[TSP Tour Construction];\n    O[Greedy Heuristic] --> U;\n    P[Savings Algorithm] --> U;\n    Q[Manhattan Distance] --> V[Distance Metric];\n```\n\nThese graphs visually map the relationships between the core topics, providing a clear and easy-to-understand overview of the essential concepts for the exam.",
