        "summary": "### Summary of Core Topics, Concepts, Principles, and Equations\n\n#### Core Topics and Concepts\n\n1. **Search Methods for Problem Solving**\n   - **State Space Search**: Understanding state spaces, state space graphs, and the properties of states and moves.\n   - **Search Algorithms**: Depth First Search (DFS), Breadth First Search (BFS), Best First Search, and Hill Climbing.\n   - **Heuristics**: Manhattan distance, Nearest Neighbour Heuristic, Greedy Heuristic.\n   - **Graph Representation**: Nodes, edges, and graph traversal techniques.\n\n2. **Water Jug Puzzle**\n   - **State Representation**: Representing states as tuples, e.g., (3, 0, 0).\n   - **Moves**: Basic moves allowed in the puzzle, such as filling and emptying jugs.\n   - **State Space Graph**: Constructing and analyzing the state space graph.\n\n3. **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)**\n   - **Tour Representations**: Path representations, adjacency representations, and ordinal representations.\n   - **Heuristics and Algorithms**: Nearest Neighbour Heuristic, Greedy Heuristic, and Partially Mapped Crossover (PMX).\n   - **Savings List**: Computing savings and constructing savings tours.\n\n4. **Graph Theory**\n   - **Nodes and Edges**: Understanding the structure and connections in a graph.\n   - **Special Nodes**: Start and goal nodes, and their significance in search algorithms.\n   - **Distance Matrix**: Using distance matrices to compute edge costs and construct tours.\n\n#### Important Principles\n\n1. **State Space Search**\n   - **Reversibility of Moves**: Not all moves are reversible in a state space.\n   - **Reachability**: Not all states are reachable from every other state.\n   - **Goal State Reachability**: The goal state may or may not be reachable from the start state.\n\n2. **Search Algorithms**\n   - **DFS**: Explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.\n   - **BFS**: Explores all neighbors at the present depth before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\n   - **Best First Search**: Uses a priority queue to explore the most promising nodes first.\n   - **Hill Climbing**: Iteratively makes small changes to the current solution to improve it.\n\n3. **Heuristics**\n   - **Manhattan Distance**: A heuristic used to estimate the distance between two points in a grid.\n   - **Nearest Neighbour Heuristic**: Selects the nearest unvisited city as the next stop.\n   - **Greedy Heuristic**: Makes the locally optimal choice at each stage with the hope of finding a global optimum.\n\n#### Important Equations\n\n1. **Manhattan Distance**\n   \\[\n   D = |x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|\n   \\]\n   where \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) are the coordinates of two points.\n\n2. **Edge Costs**\n   - Edge costs are computed based on the distance between nodes. For example, the cost of an edge between nodes A and D is given by the distance between them.\n\n3. **Savings in TSP**\n   - Savings are computed to determine the reduction in cost when combining two edges. For example, the savings \\(s_{ij}\\) for combining edges \\(i\\) and \\(j\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   s_{ij} = c_{i0} + c_{0j} - c_{ij}\n   \\]\n   where \\(c_{i0}\\) and \\(c_{0j}\\) are the costs of edges from node \\(i\\) to the fulcrum node and from the fulcrum node to node \\(j\\), respectively, and \\(c_{ij}\\) is the cost of the edge directly connecting nodes \\(i\\) and \\(j\\).\n\n### Mermaid Knowledge Graph\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[Search Methods] --> B[State Space Search];\n    A --> C[Search Algorithms];\n    A --> D[Heuristics];\n    B --> E[State Representation];\n    B --> F[Moves];\n    B --> G[State Space Graph];\n    C --> H[Depth First Search];\n    C --> I[Breadth First Search];\n    C --> J[Best First Search];\n    C --> K[Hill Climbing];\n    D --> L[Manhattan Distance];\n    D --> M[Nearest Neighbour Heuristic];\n    D --> N[Greedy Heuristic];\n    A --> O[Water Jug Puzzle];\n    O --> P[State Representation];\n    O --> Q[Moves];\n    O --> R[State Space Graph];\n    A --> S[Traveling Salesman Problem];\n    S --> T[Tour Representations];\n    S --> U[Heuristics and Algorithms];\n    S --> V[Savings List];\n    U --> M;\n    U --> N;\n    U --> W[Partially Mapped Crossover];\n    A --> X[Graph Theory];\n    X --> Y[Nodes and Edges];\n    X --> Z[Special Nodes];\n    X --> AA[Distance Matrix];\n```\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[Search Algorithms] --> B[Depth First Search];\n    A --> C[Breadth First Search];\n    A --> D[Best First Search];\n    A --> E[Hill Climbing];\n    B --> F[Explores as far as possible along each branch];\n    C --> G[Explores all neighbors at present depth];\n    D --> H[Uses priority queue];\n    E --> I[Iteratively makes small changes];\n```\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[Heuristics] --> B[Manhattan Distance];\n    A --> C[Nearest Neighbour Heuristic];\n    A --> D[Greedy Heuristic];\n    B --> E[Estimates distance between two points];\n    C --> F[Selects nearest unvisited city];\n    D --> G[Makes locally optimal choice];\n```\n\nThese graphs provide a visual representation of the relationships between the core topics, concepts, and principles essential for the exam.",
