State Space and Search Algorithms\n- **State Space**: The set of all possible states in a problem.\n- **State Space Graph**: A graph where nodes represent states and edges represent transitions between states.\n- **Search Algorithms**:\n  - **Depth First Search (DFS)**: Explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.\n  - **Breadth First Search (BFS)**: Explores all neighbors at the present depth before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\n  - **Best First Search**: Explores nodes based on a priority queue, often using a heuristic to determine the order.\n  - **Hill Climbing**: A local search algorithm that continually moves in the direction of increasing value or decreasing cost.\n  - **Depth-First Iterative Deepening (DFID)**: Combines DFS and BFS to find the shortest path.\n\n#### 2. Genetic Algorithms\n- **Path Representation**: A sequence of cities representing a tour.\n- **Adjacency Representation**: A list where each element represents the city adjacent to the current city in the tour.\n- **Ordinal Representation**: A list of indices representing the order in which cities are visited.\n- **Partially Mapped Crossover (PMX)**: A genetic operator used to produce offspring from parents in genetic algorithms.\n\n#### 3. Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)\n- **Nearest Neighbor Heuristic**: Constructs a tour by repeatedly visiting the nearest unvisited city.\n- **Greedy Heuristic**: Constructs a tour by making the locally optimal choice at each stage.\n- **Savings Heuristic**: Constructs a tour by calculating the savings of combining routes.\n\n#### 4. Manhattan Distance\n- **Manhattan Distance**: A distance metric used in grid-based pathfinding, calculated as the sum of the absolute differences of their Cartesian coordinates.\n  \\[\n  \\text{Manhattan Distance} = |x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|\n  \\]\n\n### Knowledge Graph \n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[State Space] --> B[State Space Graph];\n    A --> C[Search Algorithms];\n    C --> D[Depth First Search];\n    C --> E[Breadth First Search];\n    C --> F[Best First Search];\n    C --> G[Hill Climbing];\n    C --> H[Depth-First Iterative Deepening];\n    A --> I[Genetic Algorithms];\n    I --> J[Path Representation];\n    I --> K[Adjacency Representation];\n    I --> L[Ordinal Representation];\n    I --> M[Partially Mapped Crossover];\n    A --> N[Traveling Salesman Problem];\n    N --> O[Nearest Neighbor Heuristic];\n    N --> P[Greedy Heuristic];\n    N --> Q[Savings Heuristic];\n    A --> R[Manhattan Distance];\n```\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    B[State Space Graph] --> S[Rabbits Crossing Puzzle];\n    S --> T[Start State: R-LL];\n    S --> U[Reachable States];\n    S --> V[State Transitions];\n    D[Depth First Search] --> W[Inspected Nodes: S,A,C,I];\n    D --> X[Path: S,A,C,I,G];\n    E[Breadth First Search] --> Y[Inspected Nodes: S,A,B,C];\n    E --> Z[Path: S,A,D,G];\n    F[Best First Search] --> AA[Inspected Nodes: S,B,F,E];\n    F --> AB[Path: S,B,F,J,G];\n    G[Hill Climbing] --> AC[Inspected Nodes: S,B,F,E];\n    G --> AD[Path: NIL];\n```\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    J[Path Representation] --> AE[Valid Paths: B,I,G,H,E,A,D,J,F,C];\n    K[Adjacency Representation] --> AF[Valid Adjacency: D,I,B,J,A,C,H,E,G,F];\n    L[Ordinal Representation] --> AG[Ordinal: 7,5,6,4,6,4,2,3,2,1];\n    M[Partially Mapped Crossover] --> AH[Offspring: G,J,B,H,E,A,D,I,C,F];\n    O[Nearest Neighbor Heuristic] --> AI[Tour: B,A,D,C,E];\n    O --> AJ[Cost: 201];\n    P[Greedy Heuristic] --> AK[Tour: B,D,A,C,E];\n    P --> AL[Cost: 210];\n    Q[Savings Heuristic] --> AM[Tour: B,A,E,C,D];\n```\n\nThis summary and the knowledge graphs should help you understand the core topics and their relationships for the exam.",
