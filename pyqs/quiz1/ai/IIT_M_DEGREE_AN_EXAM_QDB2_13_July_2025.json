State Space Search\n- **State Representation**: Represented by a three-digit number \"abc\" where a, b, and c indicate the number of shells in cups A, B, and C, respectively.\n- **Move Generation**: A single move involves selecting a non-empty cup, removing all shells, and distributing them in a round-robin manner.\n- **Valid Move**: A move is valid if the first digit of the output state is greater than or equal to the first digit of the input state.\n- **Heuristic Function**: h(abc) = a + b, which returns the number of shells in the first two cups.\n\n#### 2. Search Algorithms\n- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: Explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.\n- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Explores all neighbors at the present depth before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\n- **Best-First Search**: Explores a graph by expanding the most promising node chosen according to a specified rule.\n- **Hill Climbing**: An iterative algorithm that starts with an arbitrary solution to a problem, then attempts to find a better solution by making an incremental change to the solution.\n\n#### 3. Genetic Algorithms\n- **Constructive Methods**: Algorithms that build a solution step by step, such as Greedy Heuristic, Nearest Neighbour Heuristic, and Savings Heuristic.\n- **Tour Representations**: Different ways to represent tours in the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), including Path Representation, Adjacency Representation, and Ordinal Representation.\n- **Crossover Methods**: Techniques like single-point crossover and midpoint crossover used in genetic algorithms to combine the genetic information of two parents to generate new offspring.\n\n#### 4. Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)\n- **Distance Matrix**: A matrix representing the distances between cities.\n- **Heuristics for TSP**: Algorithms like Nearest Neighbour Heuristic, Greedy Heuristic, and Savings Heuristic used to find approximate solutions to the TSP.\n- **Tour Construction**: Building a tour by visiting cities in a specific order to minimize the total distance traveled.\n\n### Equations\n- **Heuristic Function**: \\( h(abc) = a + b \\)\n- **Move Generation**: For a state \"abc\", the valid moves are generated by selecting a non-empty cup and distributing the shells in a round-robin manner.\n\n### Knowledge Graph \n\n#### Graph 1: State Space Search\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[State Space Search] --> B[State Representation];\n    A --> C[Move Generation];\n    A --> D[Valid Move];\n    A --> E[Heuristic Function];\n    B --> F[abc: a, b, c];\n    C --> G[Select Cup];\n    C --> H[Remove Shells];\n    C --> I[Distribute Shells];\n    D --> J[First Digit Condition];\n    E --> K[h(abc) = a + b];\n```\n\n#### Graph 2: Search Algorithms\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    L[Search Algorithms] --> M[Depth-First Search];\n    L --> N[Breadth-First Search];\n    L --> O[Best-First Search];\n    L --> P[Hill Climbing];\n    M --> Q[Explore Branches];\n    N --> R[Explore Neighbors];\n    O --> S[Expand Promising Node];\n    P --> T[Iterative Improvement];\n```\n\n#### Graph 3: Genetic Algorithms\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    U[Genetic Algorithms] --> V[Constructive Methods];\n    U --> W[Tour Representations];\n    U --> X[Crossover Methods];\n    V --> Y[Greedy Heuristic];\n    V --> Z[Nearest Neighbour Heuristic];\n    V --> AA[Savings Heuristic];\n    W --> AB[Path Representation];\n    W --> AC[Adjacency Representation];\n    W --> AD[Ordinal Representation];\n    X --> AE[Single-Point Crossover];\n    X --> AF[Midpoint Crossover];\n```\n\n#### Graph 4: Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    AG[TSP] --> AH[Distance Matrix];\n    AG --> AI[Heuristics];\n    AG --> AJ[Tour Construction];\n    AH --> AK[City Distances];\n    AI --> AL[Nearest Neighbour Heuristic];\n    AI --> AM[Greedy Heuristic];\n    AI --> AN[Savings Heuristic];\n    AJ --> AO[Visit Order];\n```\n\nThese graphs provide a visual representation of the relationships between the core topics and concepts essential for the exam.",
