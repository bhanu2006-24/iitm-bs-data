For example:\n\n- **Mean**: \\(\\bar{x} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i\\)\n- **Standard Deviation**: \\(\\sigma = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \\bar{x})^2}\\)\n- **Correlation Coefficient**: \\(r = \\frac{\\sum (x_i - \\bar{x})(y_i - \\bar{y})}{\\sqrt{\\sum (x_i - \\bar{x})^2 \\sum (y_i - \\bar{y})^2}}\\)\n\n### Knowledge Graph \n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[Data Visualization] --> B[Types of Visualizations];\n    A --> C[Data Types];\n    A --> D[Vector Graphics];\n    A --> E[Thematic Maps];\n    A --> F[Data Visualization Objectives];\n    A --> G[Specific Visualizations];\n    A --> H[Data Semantics];\n\n    B --> B1[Temporal];\n    B --> B2[Hierarchical];\n    B --> B3[Network-based];\n    B --> B4[Geospatial];\n    B --> B5[Static];\n\n    C --> C1[Categorical];\n    C --> C2[Ordinal];\n    C --> C3[Interval];\n    C --> C4[Ratio];\n\n    E --> E1[Choropleth Maps];\n    E --> E2[Isopleths];\n\n    F --> F1[Efficient Communication];\n    F --> F2[Comprehensibility and Accessibility];\n    F --> F3[Visual Attractiveness];\n\n    G --> G1[Pie Charts];\n    G --> G2[Bubble Charts];\n    G --> G3[Tree Maps];\n    G --> G4[Heatmaps];\n\n    H --> H1[Uncovering Patterns];\n    H --> H2[Clear Communication];\n    H --> H3[Consistency];\n```\n\nThis knowledge graph visually maps the relationships between the core topics in data visualization design, providing a clear and easy-to-understand overview of the essential concepts and principles.",
