**Nominal Data**: Categories without any order (e.g., blood groups, eye color).\n     - **Ordinal Data**: Categories with a meaningful order (e.g., customer satisfaction scales).\n   - **Numerical Data**: Quantitative data that can be measured and expressed numerically.\n     - **Interval Data**: Numerical data without a true zero (e.g., temperature in Celsius).\n     - **Ratio Data**: Numerical data with a true zero (e.g., weight, height).\n\n2. **Data Visualization Techniques**\n   - **Temporal Data**: Data that changes over time (e.g., line graphs, time series).\n   - **Hierarchical Data**: Data organized in a hierarchy (e.g., tree diagrams, dendrograms).\n   - **Network-based Data**: Data representing relationships or connections (e.g., network diagrams, flow maps).\n   - **Geospatial Data**: Data related to geographic locations (e.g., maps, choropleths, cartograms).\n\n3. **Visualization Methods**\n   - **Funnel Charts**: Used to represent stages in a process and identify potential problem areas.\n   - **Sankey Diagrams**: Used to represent the flow of information or resources.\n   - **Ridgelines**: Used to visualize the distribution of data in various categories.\n   - **Choropleths**: Used to display data in geographic areas using color gradients.\n   -
