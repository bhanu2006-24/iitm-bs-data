User traffic on Twitter has slowed since the launch of Meta\u2019s text-based platform Threads, which has already surpassed 100 million sign-ups since its debut last week.  Threads launched in the U.S. on Wednesday and is being touted by Meta executives like Instagram chief Adam Mosseri as a more positive \u201cpublic square\u201d for communities \u201cthat never really embraced Twitter.\u201d So far, users seem to be on board.  \u201cThreads reached 100 million sign ups over the weekend. That\u2019s mostly organic demand and we haven\u2019t even turned on many promotions yet. Can\u2019t believe it\u2019s only been 5 days!\u201d Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a post Monday.  Twitter appears to have taken a hit. Matthew Prince, CEO of Cloudflare, shared a screenshot to Twitter Sunday showing that traffic on the platform was \u201ctanking.\u201d  According to Similarweb, a data company that specializes in web analytics, web traffic to Twitter was down 5% for the first two full days. Threads was generally available compared with the previous week. The company said Twitter\u2019s web traffic is down 11% compared with the same days in 2022.  Twitter responded to CNBC\u2019s request for comment with an automated response. Meta didn\u2019t offer additional comment beyond Zuckerberg\u2019s post.
