I had the lonely child\u2019s habit of making up stories and holding conversations with imaginary persons, and I think from the very start my literary ambitions were mixed up with the feeling of being isolated and undervalued.

Nevertheless the volume of serious \u2013 i.e. seriously intended \u2013 writing which I produced all through my childhood and boyhood would not amount to half a dozen pages. I wrote my first poem at the age of four or five, my mother taking it down to dictation. I cannot remember anything about it except that it was about a tiger and the tiger had \u2018chair-like teeth\u2019 \u2013 a good enough phrase, but I fancy the poem was a plagiarism of Blake\u2019s \u2018Tiger, Tiger\u2019. At eleven, when the war of 1914-18 broke out, I wrote a patriotic poem which was printed in the local newspaper, as was another, two years later, on the death of Kitchener. From time to time, when I was a bit older, I wrote bad and usually unfinished \u2018nature poems\u2019 in the Georgian style. I also, about twice, attempted a short story which was a ghastly failure. That was the total of the would-be serious work that I actually set down on paper during all those years. \nSource: George Orwell\u2019s Why I Write. "
