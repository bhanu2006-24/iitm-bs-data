I had the lonely child\u2019s habit of making up stories and holding conversations with imaginary persons, and I think from the very start my literary ambitions were mixed up with the feeling of being isolated and undervalued.

I wrote my first poem at the age of four or five, my mother taking it down to dictation. I cannot remember anything about it except that it was about a tiger and the tiger had \u2018chair-like teeth\u2019 \u2013 a good enough phrase, but I fancy the poem was a plagiarism of Blake\u2019s \u2018Tiger, Tiger\u2019. At eleven, when the war of 1914-18 broke out, I wrote a patriotic poem which was printed in the local newspaper, as was another, two years later, on the death of Kitchener. From time to time, when I was a bit older, I wrote bad and usually unfinished \u2018nature poems\u2019 in the Georgian style. I also, about twice, attempted a short story which was a ghastly failure. That was the total of the would-be serious work that I actually set down on paper during all those years. \nSource: George Orwell\u2019s Why I Write. "
