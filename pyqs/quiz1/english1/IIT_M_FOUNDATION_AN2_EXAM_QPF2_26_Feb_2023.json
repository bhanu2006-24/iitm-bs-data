It is by investing in breakthrough ideas and embracing entrepreneurship as an economic model of growth that India will be able to unleash the power of innovation to ensure a better life for all its citizens. Research and innovation, fuelled by technology, will catalyse the kind of non-linear growth that will make the country one of the world\u2019s top three economies and bring it closer to developed nation status by 2047.  The government has identified research, innovation and technology as the key drivers of its VisionIndia@2047 and is making significant investments in these areas. Going forward, it must enable and support innovative start-ups and businesses that think locally but have the potential to make an enormous global impact. By encouraging technopreneurs to grow from small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to large industrial-scale operations, India will be able to create a compelling opportunity to take innovative ideas to global markets. We should aim to be among the top 20 countries in the Global Innovation Index by 2047. Digital and data-backed innovation combined with ubiquitous and affordable internet will help India build a robust digital economy of the future.  Given India\u2019s value advantage and scientific excellence, the country can innovate and drive the technology frontier outward to boost productivity and efficiency in the sphere of healthcare, thus delivering affordability and accessibility, enabling preventive health approaches and driving value across the complete spectrum of the healthcare ecosystem. Technology-led innovations will help India leapfrog the traditional linear model and take healthcare to the next level. It will help us build a national healthcare system, which is accessible, organised, accountable, affordable and, thus, resilient.  The groundwork for a digital transformation of healthcare in India has already been laid, thanks to the reforms being implemented by the Centre to make healthcare-related regulations more flexible. At the same time, the pandemic has forced changes in consumer behaviour, persuaded doctors to become tech-savvy and prompted the healthcare industry to invest in user-friendly digital solutions. These developments have created a fertile environment for the emergence of low-cost, technology-led and scalable innovations anchored in affordability and accessibility. To reap the full benefits of this digital disruption of healthcare, India will need to coordinate policymaking, funding and implementation. It will also need to put in place appropriate regulatory frameworks that foster patient trust and privacy, as well as enable faster adoption of emerging technological innovations.",

It is by investing in breakthrough ideas and embracing entrepreneurship as an economic model of growth that India will be able to unleash the power of innovation to ensure a better life for all its citizens. Research and innovation, fuelled by technology, will catalyse the kind of non-linear growth that will make the country one of the world\u2019s top three economies and bring it closer to developed nation status by 2047.  The government has identified research, innovation and technology as the key drivers of its VisionIndia@2047 and is making significant investments in these areas. Going forward, it must enable and support innovative start-ups and businesses that think locally but have the potential to make an enormous global impact. By encouraging technopreneurs to grow from small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to large industrial-scale operations, India will be able to create a compelling opportunity to take innovative ideas to global markets. We should aim to be among the top 20 countries in the Global Innovation Index by 2047. Digital and data-backed innovation combined with ubiquitous and affordable internet will help India build a robust digital economy of the future.  Given India\u2019s value advantage and scientific excellence, the country can innovate and drive the technology frontier outward to boost productivity and efficiency in the sphere of healthcare, thus delivering affordability and accessibility, enabling preventive health approaches and driving value across the complete spectrum of the healthcare ecosystem. Technology-led innovations will help India leapfrog the traditional linear model and take healthcare to the next level. It will help us build a national healthcare system, which is accessible, organised, accountable, affordable and, thus, resilient.  The groundwork for a digital transformation of healthcare in India has already been laid, thanks to the reforms being implemented by the Centre to make healthcare-related regulations more flexible. At the same time, the pandemic has forced changes in consumer behaviour, persuaded doctors to become tech-savvy and prompted the healthcare industry to invest in user-friendly digital solutions. These developments have created a fertile environment for the emergence of low-cost, technology-led and scalable innovations anchored in affordability and accessibility. To reap the full benefits of this digital disruption of healthcare, India will need to coordinate policymaking, funding and implementation. It will also need to put in place appropriate regulatory frameworks that foster patient trust and privacy, as well as enable faster adoption of emerging technological innovations.",

                            "Read the following passage and answer the given subquestions.\n My vision for India in the 100th year of its Independence is that of a global innovation leader focused on equitable and inclusive economic growth where everyone prospers in a secure environment with equal access to healthcare, education and sustainable livelihoods. It is by investing in breakthrough ideas and embracing entrepreneurship as an economic model of growth that India will be able to unleash the power of innovation to ensure a better life for all its citizens. Research and innovation, fuelled by technology, will catalyse the kind of non-linear growth that will make the country one of the world\u2019s top three economies and bring it closer to developed nation status by 2047.  The government has identified research, innovation and technology as the key drivers of its VisionIndia@2047 and is making significant investments in these areas. Going forward, it must enable and support innovative start-ups and businesses that think locally but have the potential to make an enormous global impact. By encouraging technopreneurs to grow from small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to large industrial-scale operations, India will be able to create a compelling opportunity to take innovative ideas to global markets. We should aim to be among the top 20 countries in the Global Innovation Index by 2047. Digital and data-backed innovation combined with ubiquitous and affordable internet will help India build a robust digital economy of the future.  Given India\u2019s value advantage and scientific excellence, the country can innovate and drive the technology frontier outward to boost productivity and efficiency in the sphere of healthcare, thus delivering affordability and accessibility, enabling preventive health approaches and driving value across the complete spectrum of the healthcare ecosystem. Technology-led innovations will help India leapfrog the traditional linear model and take healthcare to the next level. It will help us build a national healthcare system, which is accessible, organised, accountable, affordable and, thus, resilient.  The groundwork for a digital transformation of healthcare in India has already been laid, thanks to the reforms being implemented by the Centre to make healthcare-related regulations more flexible. At the same time, the pandemic has forced changes in consumer behaviour, persuaded doctors to become tech-savvy and prompted the healthcare industry to invest in user-friendly digital solutions. These developments have created a fertile environment for the emergence of low-cost, technology-led and scalable innovations anchored in affordability and accessibility. To reap the full benefits of this digital disruption of healthcare, India will need to coordinate policymaking, funding and implementation. It will also need to put in place appropriate regulatory frameworks that foster patient trust and privacy, as well as enable faster adoption of emerging technological innovations."

It is by investing in breakthrough ideas and embracing entrepreneurship as an economic model of growth that India will be able to unleash the power of innovation to ensure a better life for all its citizens. Research and innovation, fuelled by technology, will catalyse the kind of non-linear growth that will make the country one of the world\u2019s top three economies and bring it closer to developed nation status by 2047.  The government has identified research, innovation and technology as the key drivers of its VisionIndia@2047 and is making significant investments in these areas. Going forward, it must enable and support innovative start-ups and businesses that think locally but have the potential to make an enormous global impact. By encouraging technopreneurs to grow from small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to large industrial-scale operations, India will be able to create a compelling opportunity to take innovative ideas to global markets. We should aim to be among the top 20 countries in the Global Innovation Index by 2047. Digital and data-backed innovation combined with ubiquitous and affordable internet will help India build a robust digital economy of the future.  Given India\u2019s value advantage and scientific excellence, the country can innovate and drive the technology frontier outward to boost productivity and efficiency in the sphere of healthcare, thus delivering affordability and accessibility, enabling preventive health approaches and driving value across the complete spectrum of the healthcare ecosystem. Technology-led innovations will help India leapfrog the traditional linear model and take healthcare to the next level. It will help us build a national healthcare system, which is accessible, organised, accountable, affordable and, thus, resilient.  The groundwork for a digital transformation of healthcare in India has already been laid, thanks to the reforms being implemented by the Centre to make healthcare-related regulations more flexible. At the same time, the pandemic has forced changes in consumer behaviour, persuaded doctors to become tech-savvy and prompted the healthcare industry to invest in user-friendly digital solutions. These developments have created a fertile environment for the emergence of low-cost, technology-led and scalable innovations anchored in affordability and accessibility. To reap the full benefits of this digital disruption of healthcare, India will need to coordinate policymaking, funding and implementation. It will also need to put in place appropriate regulatory frameworks that foster patient trust and privacy, as well as enable faster adoption of emerging technological innovations.",
