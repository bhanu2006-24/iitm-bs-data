We are unhappy partly because we desire much more than what we can hope to attain. Our countless desires are hard to satisfy. And that is what makes us so sad in life.  The secret of happiness lies in the simplification of life. Simple living encourages high thinking. It leads to contentment. Contentment gives us inner wealth, the wealth of the mind and of the soul. A contented man devotes himself to virtues like truth, beauty, love, goodness, kindness, and charity. By pursuing and inculcating their virtues, a man can feel true happiness.  I do not mean that for simplification of life, a man should become an ascetic. The happiness of sadhu is of a negative kind. I want a positive kind of happiness. For this, I must live in the midst of life, faithfully carrying out my responsibilities to my home and my country. But all of this should be done in the spirit of selfless service. A man who wants to lead a happy life, should also make others happy. In making others happy, he will taste real and lasting happiness. There is a kind of joy in serving others with virtuous motives, in sacrificing what one has for the good of others. An act of goodness is in itself an act of happiness.  The secret of perfect happiness lies in renunciation. Wealth may give us joy for a while and fame may provide us with fleeting excitement. But they cannot give us permanent happiness. Kings have everything to make them happy and yet they feel unhappy. It is because they do not practice renunciation.  There is a sense of joy in doing one\u2019s work honestly and efficiently. A research-worker feels joy in conducting research while a journalist in writing. In doing one\u2019s duty sincerely, one feels a peace of mind, which is an important essence of happiness.  It is only by cultivating a spirit of renunciation, self-sacrifice, contentment, and sincere work that one can really be happy. The strings of misfortune spare none, but they will not cow such a person.",

We are unhappy partly because we desire much more than what we can hope to attain. Our countless desires are hard to satisfy. And that is what makes us so sad in life.  The secret of happiness lies in the simplification of life. Simple living encourages high thinking. It leads to contentment. Contentment gives us inner wealth, the wealth of the mind and of the soul. A contented man devotes himself to virtues like truth, beauty, love, goodness, kindness, and charity. By pursuing and inculcating their virtues, a man can feel true happiness.  I do not mean that for simplification of life, a man should become an ascetic. The happiness of sadhu is of a negative kind. I want a positive kind of happiness. For this, I must live in the midst of life, faithfully carrying out my responsibilities to my home and my country. But all of this should be done in the spirit of selfless service. A man who wants to lead a happy life, should also make others happy. In making others happy, he will taste real and lasting happiness. There is a kind of joy in serving others with virtuous motives, in sacrificing what one has for the good of others. An act of goodness is in itself an act of happiness.  The secret of perfect happiness lies in renunciation. Wealth may give us joy for a while and fame may provide us with fleeting excitement. But they cannot give us permanent happiness. Kings have everything to make them happy and yet they feel unhappy. It is because they do not practice renunciation.  There is a sense of joy in doing one\u2019s work honestly and efficiently. A research-worker feels joy in conducting research while a journalist in writing. In doing one\u2019s duty sincerely, one feels a peace of mind, which is an important essence of happiness.  It is only by cultivating a spirit of renunciation, self-sacrifice, contentment, and sincere work that one can really be happy. The strings of misfortune spare none, but they will not cow such a person.",

We are unhappy partly because we desire much more than what we can hope to attain. Our countless desires are hard to satisfy. And that is what makes us so sad in life.  The secret of happiness lies in the simplification of life. Simple living encourages high thinking. It leads to contentment. Contentment gives us inner wealth, the wealth of the mind and of the soul. A contented man devotes himself to virtues like truth, beauty, love, goodness, kindness, and charity. By pursuing and inculcating their virtues, a man can feel true happiness.  I do not mean that for simplification of life, a man should become an ascetic. The happiness of sadhu is of a negative kind. I want a positive kind of happiness. For this, I must live in the midst of life, faithfully carrying out my responsibilities to my home and my country. But all of this should be done in the spirit of selfless service. A man who wants to lead a happy life, should also make others happy. In making others happy, he will taste real and lasting happiness. There is a kind of joy in serving others with virtuous motives, in sacrificing what one has for the good of others. An act of goodness is in itself an act of happiness.  The secret of perfect happiness lies in renunciation. Wealth may give us joy for a while and fame may provide us with fleeting excitement. But they cannot give us permanent happiness. Kings have everything to make them happy and yet they feel unhappy. It is because they do not practice renunciation.  There is a sense of joy in doing one\u2019s work honestly and efficiently.

We are unhappy partly because we desire much more than what we can hope to attain. Our countless desires are hard to satisfy. And that is what makes us so sad in life.  The secret of happiness lies in the simplification of life. Simple living encourages high thinking. It leads to contentment. Contentment gives us inner wealth, the wealth of the mind and of the soul. A contented man devotes himself to virtues like truth, beauty, love, goodness, kindness, and charity. By pursuing and inculcating their virtues, a man can feel true happiness.  I do not mean that for simplification of life, a man should become an ascetic. The happiness of sadhu is of a negative kind. I want a positive kind of happiness. For this, I must live in the midst of life, faithfully carrying out my responsibilities to my home and my country. But all of this should be done in the spirit of selfless service. A man who wants to lead a happy life, should also make others happy. In making others happy, he will taste real and lasting happiness. There is a kind of joy in serving others with virtuous motives, in sacrificing what one has for the good of others. An act of goodness is in itself an act of happiness.  The secret of perfect happiness lies in renunciation. Wealth may give us joy for a while and fame may provide us with fleeting excitement. But they cannot give us permanent happiness. Kings have everything to make them happy and yet they feel unhappy. It is because they do not practice renunciation.  There is a sense of joy in doing one\u2019s work honestly and efficiently. A research-worker feels joy in conducting research while a journalist in writing. In doing one\u2019s duty sincerely, one feels a peace of mind, which is an important essence of happiness.  It is only by cultivating a spirit of renunciation, self-sacrifice, contentment, and sincere work that one can really be happy. The strings of misfortune spare none, but they will not cow such a person.",
