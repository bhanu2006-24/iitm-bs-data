Only one should have eyes to behold it and heart to feel it like the English poet William Wordsworth who after seeing daffodils said; \u201cAnd then my heart with pleasure fills and dances with the daffodils\u201d. Nature is a great teacher. The early man was thrilled with beauty and wonders of nature. The Aryans worshipped nature. One can learn the lessons in the vast school of nature.  Unfortunately, the strife, the stress and the tension of modern life have made people immune to beauties of nature. Their life is so full of care that they have no time to stand and stare. They cannot enjoy the beauty of flowing rivers, swinging trees, flying birds and majestic mountains and hills. There is however, a cry to go back to village from the concrete and artificial jungle of cities. Hence the town planners of today pay special attention to provide enough number of natural scenic spots in town planning. To develop a balanced personality, one needs to have a healthy attitude which can make us appreciate and enjoy the beauty of nature.  There is other balm to soothe our tired soul and listless mind than the infinite nature all around us.

Nature is a great teacher. The early man was thrilled with beauty and wonders of nature. The Aryans worshipped nature. One can learn the lessons in the vast school of nature.

Hence the town planners of today pay special attention to provide enough number of natural scenic spots in town planning. To develop a balanced personality, one needs to have a healthy attitude which can make us appreciate and enjoy the beauty of nature.
