Set Theory and Relations\n- **Cardinality of Sets**: Understanding the size of sets and Cartesian products.\n- **Relations and Functions**: Definitions and properties of reflexive, symmetric, and transitive relations.\n- **Types of Functions**: One-one (injective), onto (surjective) functions.\n\n#### 2. Linear Algebra\n- **Lines and Slopes**: Equations of lines, slopes, and intercepts.\n  - Slope of a line: \\( m = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} \\)\n  - Equation of a line: \\( y = mx + c \\)\n- **Parallel and Perpendicular Lines**: Conditions for lines to be parallel or perpendicular.\n  - Parallel lines: \\( m_1 = m_2 \\)\n  - Perpendicular lines: \\( m_1 \\cdot m_2 = -1 \\)\n- **Distance from a Point to a Line**: Formula for the distance from a point \\((x_0, y_0)\\) to a line \\(Ax + By + C = 0\\).\n  - Distance formula: \\( \\frac{|Ax_0 + By_0 + C|}{\\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}} \\)\n\n#### 3. Polynomials\n- **Degree of Polynomials**: Understanding the degree of polynomials and their operations.\n- **Roots and Multiplicity**: Finding roots and their multiplicities.\n- **Turning Points**: Understanding the behavior of polynomial functions and their turning points.\n\n#### 4. Quadratic Functions\n- **Slope of Quadratic Functions**: Finding the slope at a specific point.\n  - Slope of \\( q(x) = ax^2 + bx + c \\) at \\( x = x_0 \\): \\( q'(x_0) = 2ax_0 + b \\)\n- **Minimum and Maximum Values**: Finding the vertex and extrema of quadratic functions.\n  - Vertex of \\( q(x) = ax^2 + bx + c \\): \\( x = -\\frac{b}{2a} \\)\n\n#### 5. Statistics\n- **Sum of Squared Errors (SSE)**: Calculating the sum of squared errors for a line of best fit.\n  - SSE formula: \\( \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2 \\)\n\n#### 6. Survey and Probability\n- **Venn Diagrams and Set Operations**: Understanding intersections and unions of sets.\n- **Minimum and Maximum Overlaps**: Calculating minimum and maximum overlaps in surveys.\n\n### Knowledge Graph \n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[Mathematics for Data Science] --> B[Set Theory and Relations];\n    A --> C[Linear Algebra];\n    A --> D[Polynomials];\n    A --> E[Quadratic Functions];\n    A --> F[Statistics];\n    A --> G[Survey and Probability];\n\n    B --> B1[Cardinality of Sets];\n    B --> B2[Relations and Functions];\n    B --> B3[Types of Functions];\n\n    C --> C1[Lines and Slopes];\n    C --> C2[Parallel and Perpendicular Lines];\n    C --> C3[Distance from a Point to a Line];\n\n    D --> D1[Degree of Polynomials];\n    D --> D2[Roots and Multiplicity];\n    D --> D3[Turning Points];\n\n    E --> E1[Slope of Quadratic Functions];\n    E --> E2[Minimum and Maximum Values];\n\n    F --> F1[Sum of Squared Errors];\n\n    G --> G1[Venn Diagrams and Set Operations];\n    G --> G2[Minimum and Maximum Overlaps];\n```\n\nThis summary and knowledge graph should help you focus on the essential topics and understand the relationships between them for your exam preparation.",
