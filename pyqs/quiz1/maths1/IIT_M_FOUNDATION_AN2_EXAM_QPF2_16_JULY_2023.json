Mathematically, \\( \\forall a \\in S, (a, a) \\in R \\).\n- **Symmetric Relation**: A relation \\( R \\) is symmetric if \\( (a, b) \\in R \\) implies \\( (b, a) \\in R \\).\n- **Transitive Relation**: A relation \\( R \\) is transitive if \\( (a, b) \\in R \\) and \\( (b, c) \\in R \\) imply \\( (a, c) \\in R \\).\n- **Equivalence Relation**: A relation that is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.\n- **Function**: A relation where each input has exactly one output.\n- **Injective (One-one) Function**: A function where different inputs give different outputs.\n- **Surjective (Onto) Function**: A function where every element of the codomain is mapped to by some element of the domain.\n\n#### 2. **Polynomials**\n- **Polynomial Representation**: \\( p(x) = a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \\dots + a_0 \\).\n- **Roots and Turning Points**: Roots are the solutions to \\( p(x) = 0 \\). Turning points are where the derivative \\( p'(x) = 0 \\).\n- **Quotient and Remainder**: When dividing polynomials, \\( p(x) = q(x) \\cdot d(x) + r(x) \\), where \\( q(x) \\) is the quotient and \\( r(x) \\) is the remainder.\n\n#### 3. **Linear Algebra**\n- **Line Equations**: \\( y = mx + c \\), where \\( m \\) is the slope and \\( c \\) is the y-intercept.\n- **Distance Between Parallel Lines**: For lines \\( ax + by + c_1 = 0 \\) and \\( ax + by + c_2 = 0 \\), the distance is \\( \\frac{|c_2 - c_1|}{\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}} \\).\n\n#### 4. **Set Theory**\n- **Cardinality**: The number of elements in a set.\n- **Venn Diagrams**: Used to visualize the relationships between different sets.\n\n#### 5. **Calculus**\n- **Derivatives**: Used to find slopes and turning points of functions.\n- **Maxima and Minima**: Critical points where the derivative is zero or undefined.\n\n#### 6. **Statistics**\n- **Best Fit Line**: Minimizing the Sum of Squared Errors (SSE) to find the line of best fit \\( y = mx + c \\).\n\n### Important Equations\n\n1. **Quadratic Function**:\n   \\[\n   q(x) = ax^2 + bx + c\n   \\]\n   - Vertex at \\( x = -\\frac{b}{2a} \\).\n   - Discriminant \\( \\Delta = b^2 - 4ac \\).\n\n2. **Polynomial Division**:\n   \\[\n   p(x) = q(x) \\cdot d(x) + r(x)\n   \\]\n\n3. **Line Equation**:\n   \\[\n   y = mx + c\n   \\]\n\n4. **Distance Between Parallel Lines**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Distance} = \\frac{|c_2 - c_1|}{\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Sum of Squared Errors (SSE)**:\n   \\[\n   SSE = \\sum (y_i - (mx_i + c))^2\n   \\]\n\n### Knowledge Graph \n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[Mathematics for Data Science] --> B[Relations and Functions];\n    A --> C[Polynomials];\n    A --> D[Linear Algebra];\n    A --> E[Set Theory];\n    A --> F[Calculus];\n    A --> G[Statistics];\n\n    B --> B1[Reflexive Relation];\n    B --> B2[Symmetric Relation];\n    B --> B3[Transitive Relation];\n    B --> B4[Equivalence Relation];\n    B --> B5[Function];\n    B --> B6[Injective Function];\n    B --> B7[Surjective Function];\n\n    C --> C1[Polynomial Representation];\n    C --> C2[Roots and Turning Points];\n    C --> C3[Quotient and Remainder];\n\n    D --> D1[Line Equations];\n    D --> D2[Distance Between Parallel Lines];\n\n    E --> E1[Cardinality];\n    E --> E2[Venn Diagrams];\n\n    F --> F1[Derivatives];\n    F --> F2[Maxima and Minima];\n\n    G --> G1[Best Fit Line];\n    G --> G2[Sum of Squared Errors];\n```\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[Polynomials] --> B[Roots];\n    A --> C[Turning Points];\n    A --> D[Quotient];\n    A --> E[Remainder];\n\n    B --> B1[Solutions to p(x) = 0];\n    C --> C1[Critical Points];\n    D --> D1[Division of Polynomials];\n    E --> E1[Remainder Theorem];\n```\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[Linear Algebra] --> B[Line Equations];\n    A --> C[Distance Between Parallel Lines];\n\n    B --> B1[Slope-Intercept Form];\n    C --> C1[Distance Formula];\n```\n\nThese graphs provide a visual representation of the relationships between the core topics in the subject \"Mathematics for Data Science I\".",
