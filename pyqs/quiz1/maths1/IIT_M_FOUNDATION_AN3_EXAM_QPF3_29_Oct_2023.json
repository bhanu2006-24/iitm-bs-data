\\(\\mathbb{Z}\\): Set of integers\n  - \\(\\mathbb{N}\\): Set of natural numbers (including 0)\n\n#### 2. **Survey and Set Operations**\n- **Minimum Number of People Liking Both Games**:\n  - Use the principle of inclusion-exclusion.\n  - Formula: \\( |A \\cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \\cap B| \\)\n  - For minimum overlap: \\( |A \\cap B| = |A| + |B| - |U| \\)\n  - Where \\( |U| \\) is the total number of people surveyed.\n\n#### 3. **Functions and Their Properties**\n- **Domain and Range**:\n  - Domain of \\( f \\): \\( \\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\{0\\} \\)\n  - Range of \\( f \\): \\( (0, \\infty) \\)\n- **One-One Function**:\n  - A function \\( f \\) is one-one (injective) if \\( f(a) = f(b) \\) implies \\( a = b \\).\n- **Minimum Value of a Function**:\n  -

Slope of \\( q(x) \\): \\( q'(x) = 2ax + 20 \\)\n  - At \\( x = 2 \\): \\( q'(2) = 4a + 20 \\)\n  - Slope of the line \\( y = 40x + 5 \\) is 40.\n  - Therefore, \\( 4a + 20 = 40 \\) implies \\( a = 5 \\).\n\n#### 5. **Straight Lines and Their Properties**\n- **Equations of Lines**:\n  - \\(\\ell_1 : 2x + 3y = 2\\)\n  - \\(\\ell_2 : x + 3y = 5\\)\n  - \\(\\ell_3 : 3x + 9y = 7\\)\n- **Parallel Lines**:\n  - Lines are parallel if their slopes are equal.\n  - Slope of \\(\\ell_1\\): \\( m_1 = -\\frac{2}{3} \\)\n  - Slope of \\(\\ell_2\\): \\( m_2 = -\\frac{1}{3} \\)\n  - Slope of \\(\\ell_3\\): \\( m_3 = -\\frac{1}{3} \\)\n  - Therefore, \\(\\ell_2\\) and \\(\\ell_3\\) are parallel.\n\n#### 6. **Optimization Problems**\n- **Cost Function**:\n  - Cost per item: \\( 1800 - 10 \\times (x - 150) \\) for \\( x > 150 \\)\n  - Total cost: \\( C(x) = x \\times (1800 - 10 \\times (x - 150)) \\)\n  - To find the maximum cost, take the derivative and set it to zero.\n\n#### 7. **Polynomials and Their Properties**\n- **Polynomials**:\n  -

Degree of \\( p(x)r(x) \\): Sum of the degrees of \\( p(x) \\) and \\( r(x) \\).\n- **Roots and Multiplicity**:\n  - Roots of \\( p(x) \\): \\( x = -1, 6 \\)\n  - Roots of \\( q(x) \\): \\( x = -1 \\)\n  - Roots of \\( r(x) \\): \\( x = 0, -1, 3 \\)\n  - Multiplicity of roots in \\( s(x) \\): Determined by the multiplicity in the factor polynomials.\n\n#### 8. **Relations and Functions**\n- **Relations on Sets**:\n  - \\( R_1 \\): Two quadratic functions are related if they have the same axis of symmetry.\n  - \\( R_2 \\): A relation defined as \\( R_2 = \\{((ax^2 + bx + c), (ax^2 + cx + b)) \\mid a \\neq 0, a, b, c, x \\in \\mathbb{R}\\} \\)\n- **Properties of Relations**:\n  - Reflexive: A relation \\( R \\) is reflexive if \\( (a, a) \\in R \\) for all \\( a \\in S \\).\n  - Symmetric: A relation \\( R \\) is symmetric if \\( (a, b) \\in R \\) implies \\( (b, a) \\in R \\).\n  - Transitive: A relation \\( R \\) is transitive if \\( (a, b) \\in R \\) and \\( (b, c) \\in R \\) implies \\( (a, c) \\in R \\).\n\n#### 9. **Sum of Squared Errors (SSE)**\n- **SSE Calculation**:\n  - For a line \\( \\ell \\) passing through points \\( (x_i, y_i) \\), SSE is calculated as:\n  \\[ \\text{SSE} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2 \\]\n  - Where \\( \\hat{y}_i \\) is the predicted value from the line \\( \\ell \\).\n\n### Knowledge Graph \n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[Set Theory] --> B[Notations]\n    A --> C[Survey and Set Operations]\n    C --> D[Inclusion-Exclusion Principle]\n    E[Functions] --> F[Domain and Range]\n    E --> G[One-One Function]\n    E --> H[Minimum Value]\n    I[Quadratic Functions] --> J[Slope]\n    I --> K[Quadratic Equation]\n    L[Straight Lines] --> M[Equations of Lines]\n    L --> N[Parallel Lines]\n    O[Optimization Problems] --> P[Cost Function]\n    Q[Polynomials] --> R[Degree of Polynomials]\n    Q --> S[Roots and Multiplicity]\n    T[Relations and Functions] --> U[Properties of Relations]\n    V[Sum of Squared Errors] --> W[SSE Calculation]\n```\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    B[Notations] --> B1[Real Numbers]\n    B --> B2[Rational Numbers]\n    B --> B3[Integers]\n    B --> B4[Natural Numbers]\n    D[Inclusion-Exclusion Principle] --> D1[Minimum Overlap]\n    F[Domain and Range] --> F1[Domain]\n    F --> F2[Range]\n    G[One-One Function] --> G1[Injective Function]\n    J[Slope] --> J1[Derivative]\n    K[Quadratic Equation] --> K1[Quadratic Formula]\n    M[Equations of Lines] --> M1[Slope-Intercept Form]\n    N[Parallel Lines] --> N1[Equal Slopes]\n    P[Cost Function] --> P1[Total Cost]\n    R[Degree of Polynomials] --> R1[Sum of Degrees]\n    S[Roots and Multiplicity] --> S1[Roots]\n    S --> S2[Multiplicity]\n    U[Properties of Relations] --> U1[Reflexive]\n    U --> U2[Symmetric]\n    U --> U3[Transitive]\n    W[SSE Calculation] --> W1[Sum of Squares]\n```\n\nThis summary and knowledge graph should help you understand the core topics and their relationships for the exam.",
