        "summary": "### Summary of Core Topics, Concepts, Principles, and Equations\n\n#### 1. Systems of Linear Equations\n- **No Solution Condition**: For the system \\( x + ky = 2 \\) and \\( kx + y = 2 \\), the condition for no solution is when the determinant of the coefficient matrix is zero and the system is inconsistent. This occurs when \\( k = -1 \\).\n- **Infinitely Many Solutions Condition**: For the system \\( x + ky = 2 \\) and \\( kx + y = 2 \\), the condition for infinitely many solutions is when the determinant of the coefficient matrix is zero and the system is consistent. This occurs when \\( k = 1 \\).\n- **Unique Solution**: For a unique solution, the determinant of the coefficient matrix must be non-zero. The difference \\( a - b \\) for the unique solution \\((a, b)\\) is 0.\n\n#### 2. Vector Spaces and Subspaces\n- **Basis and Dimension**: Understanding the basis and dimension of vector spaces and subspaces. For example, \\( W_1 \\) and \\( W_2 \\) are subspaces of \\( \\mathbb{R}^3 \\).\n- **Intersection of Subspaces**: The intersection of \\( W_1 \\) and \\( W_3 \\) (the \\( xy \\)-plane) is the line \\( y = 2x \\).\n- **Sum of Subspaces**: The dimension of the sum of \\( W_1 \\) and \\( W_2 \\) is 2.\n\n#### 3. Matrices and Determinants\n- **Skew-Symmetric Matrices**: A matrix \\( A \\) such that \\( A^T = -A \\). The determinant of such a matrix is zero if it is of odd order.\n- **Determinant Properties**: Swapping rows and multiplying rows by scalars affect the determinant. For example, if \\( \\det(A) = 2 \\) and \\( B \\) is obtained by swapping the second and third rows and multiplying the first row by \\(-3\\), then \\( \\det(B) = 6 \\).\n- **Characteristic Polynomial**: For a matrix \\( A \\), the characteristic polynomial \\( \\det(A - xI) \\) can be used to find eigenvalues. For \\( A = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -2 \\\\ -3 & 4 \\end{pmatrix} \\), the characteristic polynomial is \\( x^2 - 5x + 2 \\), so \\( a - b = 7 \\).\n\n#### 4. Rank and Linear Independence\n- **Rank of a Matrix**: The rank of a matrix is the dimension of the column space or row space. For example, the rank of \\( A = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\) is 3.\n- **Linear Independence**: Vectors are linearly independent if none can be written as a linear combination of the others. For example, the vectors \\( u_1, u_2, \\) and \\( u_3 \\) of matrix \\( B \\) lie on a plane, indicating linear dependence.\n\n#### 5. Vector Spaces and Subspaces\n- **Vector Space Definition**: A set with defined addition and scalar multiplication that satisfies certain axioms. For example, the set of all \\( n \\times n \\) matrices with rank strictly less than \\( n \\) does not form a vector space.\n- **Subspace Definition**: A subset of a vector space that is itself a vector space. For example, any vector subspace of \\( \\mathbb{R}^2 \\) with dimension 1 is of the form \\( ax + by = 0 \\) where \\( a \\neq 0 \\) or \\( b \\neq 0 \\).\n\n### Knowledge Graph \n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[Systems of Linear Equations] --> B[No Solution Condition];\n    A --> C[Infinitely Many Solutions Condition];\n    A --> D[Unique Solution];\n    B --> E[Determinant of Coefficient Matrix];\n    C --> E;\n    D --> E;\n    F[Vector Spaces and Subspaces] --> G[Basis and Dimension];\n    F --> H[Intersection of Subspaces];\n    F --> I[Sum of Subspaces];\n    J[Matrices and Determinants] --> K[Skew-Symmetric Matrices];\n    J --> L[Determinant Properties];\n    J --> M[Characteristic Polynomial];\n    N[Rank and Linear Independence] --> O[Rank of a Matrix];\n    N --> P[Linear Independence];\n    Q[Vector Spaces and Subspaces] --> R[Vector Space Definition];\n    Q --> S[Subspace Definition];\n```\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    T[Systems of Linear Equations] --> U[No Solution Condition: k = -1];\n    T --> V[Infinitely Many Solutions Condition: k = 1];\n    T --> W[Unique Solution: a - b = 0];\n    X[Vector Spaces and Subspaces] --> Y[Basis and Dimension: dim(W1 + W2) = 2];\n    X --> Z[Intersection of Subspaces: y = 2x];\n    AA[Matrices and Determinants] --> AB[Skew-Symmetric Matrices: det(A) = 0];\n    AA --> AC[Determinant Properties: det(B) = 6];\n    AA --> AD[Characteristic Polynomial: a - b = 7];\n    AE[Rank and Linear Independence] --> AF[Rank of a Matrix: rank(A) = 3];\n    AE --> AG[Linear Independence: u1, u2, u3 lie on a plane];\n    AH[Vector Spaces and Subspaces] --> AI[Vector Space Definition: n x n matrices with rank < n];\n    AH --> AJ[Subspace Definition: ax + by = 0];\n```\n\nThis summary and knowledge graph should help you understand the core topics and their relationships for the exam.",
