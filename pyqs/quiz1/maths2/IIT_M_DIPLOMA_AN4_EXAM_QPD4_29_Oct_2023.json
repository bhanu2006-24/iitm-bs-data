        "summary": "### Summary of Core Topics, Concepts, Principles, and Equations\n\n#### 1. Systems of Linear Equations\n- **No Solution Condition**: For the system \\( x + ky = 2 \\) and \\( kx + y = 2 \\), the condition for no solution is when the determinant of the coefficient matrix is zero and the system is inconsistent. This occurs when \\( k = -1 \\).\n- **Infinitely Many Solutions Condition**: For the system to have infinitely many solutions, the determinant of the coefficient matrix must be zero, and the system must be consistent. This occurs when \\( k = 1 \\).\n- **Unique Solution**: For a unique solution, the determinant of the coefficient matrix must be non-zero. The difference \\( a - b \\) for the unique solution \\((a, b)\\) is 0.\n\n#### 2. Vector Spaces and Subspaces\n- **Basis and Dimension**: Understanding the basis and dimension of vector spaces \\( W_1, W_2, \\) and \\( W_3 \\).\n  - \\( W_1 = \\{(x, y, z) \\in \\mathbb{R}^3 : 2x - y + z = 0\\} \\)\n  - \\( W_2 = \\{(x, y, z) \\in \\mathbb{R}^3 : 2x - y + z = 0, 2x + y - 3z = 0\\} \\)\n  - \\( W_3 \\) is the \\( xy \\)-plane.\n- **Intersection and Span**: The intersection of \\( W_1 \\) and \\( W_3 \\) is the line \\( y = 2x \\), spanned by the vector \\( (2, 1, 0) \\).\n- **Dimension of Sum of Subspaces**: \\( \\dim(W_1 + W_2) = 2 \\).\n\n#### 3. Matrices and Determinants\n- **Skew-Symmetric Matrices**: For a matrix \\( A \\) such that \\( A^T = -A \\), the determinant \\( \\det(A) = 0 \\).\n- **Determinant Properties**: For a \\( 3 \\times 3 \\) matrix \\( A \\) with \\( \\det(A) = 2 \\), if \\( B \\) is obtained by swapping the second and third rows and then multiplying the first row by \\(-3\\), then \\( \\det(B) = 6 \\).\n- **Characteristic Polynomial**: For a matrix \\( A = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -2 \\\\ -3 & 4 \\end{pmatrix} \\), the characteristic polynomial \\( \\det(A - xI) = x^2 - ax + b \\) gives \\( a - b = 7 \\).\n\n#### 4. Rank and Linear Independence\n- **Rank of a Matrix**: The rank of a matrix \\( A \\) is the dimension of the column space or row space.\n- **Linear Independence**: Vectors \\( v_1, v_2, \\) and \\( v_3 \\) are linearly independent if the determinant of the matrix formed by these vectors is non-zero.\n\n#### 5. Vector Spaces and Subspaces\n- **Vector Space Axioms**: Understanding the conditions under which a set forms a vector space.\n- **Subspace Dimension**: Any vector subspace of \\( \\mathbb{R}^2 \\) with dimension 1 is of the form \\( ax + by = 0 \\) where \\( a \\neq 0 \\) or \\( b \\neq 0 \\).\n\n### Knowledge Graph \n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[Systems of Linear Equations] --> B[No Solution Condition];\n    A --> C[Infinitely Many Solutions Condition];\n    A --> D[Unique Solution];\n    B --> E[Determinant of Coefficient Matrix];\n    C --> E;\n    D --> E;\n    F[Vector Spaces and Subspaces] --> G[Basis and Dimension];\n    F --> H[Intersection and Span];\n    F --> I[Dimension of Sum of Subspaces];\n    J[Matrices and Determinants] --> K[Skew-Symmetric Matrices];\n    J --> L[Determinant Properties];\n    J --> M[Characteristic Polynomial];\n    N[Rank and Linear Independence] --> O[Rank of a Matrix];\n    N --> P[Linear Independence];\n    Q[Vector Spaces and Subspaces] --> R[Vector Space Axioms];\n    Q --> S[Subspace Dimension];\n```\n\n### Additional Knowledge Graph for Specific Concepts\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    T[Linear Equations] --> U[Consistent Systems];\n    T --> V[Inconsistent Systems];\n    U --> W[Unique Solution];\n    U --> X[Infinitely Many Solutions];\n    V --> Y[No Solution];\n    Z[Matrices] --> AA[Determinant];\n    Z --> AB[Rank];\n    Z --> AC[Characteristic Polynomial];\n    AD[Vector Spaces] --> AE[Basis];\n    AD --> AF[Dimension];\n    AD --> AG[Subspaces];\n```\n\nThis summary and the knowledge graphs should help you understand the core topics and their relationships, preparing you effectively for the exam.",
