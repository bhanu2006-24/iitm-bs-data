        "summary": "### Summary of Core Topics, Concepts, Principles, and Equations\n\n#### 1. **Web Development and HTTP**\n- **URL Structure**: Understanding the components of a URL (Protocol, Domain, Path, Query Parameter).\n  - Example: `https://www.google.com/search?q=physics+books`\n    - Protocol: `https`\n    - Domain: `www.google.com`\n    - Path: `/search`\n    - Query Parameter: `q=physics+books`\n\n- **HTTP Methods**: GET and POST methods in HTTP requests.\n  - GET: Requests data from a specified resource.\n  - POST: Submits data to be processed to a specified resource.\n\n- **HTTP Status Codes**: Understanding different HTTP status codes.\n  - 200 OK: The request was successful.\n  - 404 Not Found: The server cannot find the requested resource.\n  - 500 Internal Server Error: A generic error message returned when an unexpected condition was encountered.\n\n- **Flask Framework**: Basics of Flask, a micro web framework for Python.\n  - Routing: Defining routes in Flask using the `@app.route` decorator.\n  - Request Methods: Handling different HTTP methods in Flask.\n  - Templates: Using Jinja2 templates in Flask.\n\n#### 2. **HTML and Forms**\n- **HTML Tables**: Structure and rendering of HTML tables.\n  - Example:\n    ```html\n    <table border=\"2\">\n        <tr>\n            <th>One</th>\n            <td>Four</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <th>Two</th>\n            <td>Three</td>\n        </tr>\n    </table>\n    ```\n\n- **HTML Forms**: Creating and handling forms in HTML.\n  - Example:\n    ```html\n    <form method=\"POST\">\n        Enter Your Name: <input type=\"text\" name=\"name\">\n        <button>Submit</button>\n    </form>\n    ```\n\n#### 3. **Networking Concepts**\n- **Bandwidth and Latency**: Understanding the concepts of bandwidth and latency in networking.\n  - Bandwidth: The maximum rate of data transfer across a given path.\n  - Latency: The time it takes for a packet of data to travel from one point to another.\n\n- **Round Trip Time (RTT)**: The time it takes for a signal to be sent plus the time it takes for an acknowledgment of that signal to be received.\n  - Calculation: RTT = Time to send a request + Time to receive a response.\n\n#### 4. **Python and Flask**\n- **Flask Routes**: Defining and handling routes in Flask.\n  - Example:\n    ```python\n    from flask import Flask\n    app = Flask(__name__)\n\n    @app.route('/')\n    def home():\n        return \"Hello, World!\"\n\n    if __name__ == '__main__':\n        app.run(debug=True)\n    ```\n\n- **Flask Request Handling**: Handling different types of HTTP requests in Flask.\n  - Example:\n    ```python\n    from flask import Flask, request\n\n    app = Flask(__name__)\n\n    @app.route('/', methods=['GET', 'POST'])\n    def home():\n        if request.method == 'GET':\n            return \"GET request\"\n        elif request.method == 'POST':\n            return \"POST request\"\n\n    if __name__ == '__main__':\n        app.run(debug=True)\n    ```\n\n#### 5. **Jinja2 Templates**\n- **Template Rendering**: Using Jinja2 templates to render dynamic content.\n  - Example:\n    ```python\n    from flask import Flask, render_template\n    from jinja2 import Template\n\n    app = Flask(__name__)\n\n    @app.route('/')\n    def home():\n        template = Template('Hello, {{ name }}!')\n        return template.render(name='World')\n\n    if __name__ == '__main__':\n        app.run(debug=True)\n    ```\n\n### Mermaid Knowledge Graph\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    WebDevelopment-->URLStructure;\n    WebDevelopment-->HTTPMethods;\n    WebDevelopment-->HTTPStatusCodes;\n    WebDevelopment-->FlaskFramework;\n    HTML-->HTMLTables;\n    HTML-->HTMLForms;\n    Networking-->BandwidthLatency;\n    Networking-->RTT;\n    Python-->FlaskRoutes;\n    Python-->FlaskRequestHandling;\n    Python-->Jinja2Templates;\n```\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    URLStructure-->Protocol;\n    URLStructure-->Domain;\n    URLStructure-->Path;\n    URLStructure-->QueryParameter;\n    HTTPMethods-->GET;\n    HTTPMethods-->POST;\n    HTTPStatusCodes-->200OK;\n    HTTPStatusCodes-->404NotFound;\n    HTTPStatusCodes-->500InternalServerError;\n    FlaskFramework-->Routing;\n    FlaskFramework-->RequestMethods;\n    FlaskFramework-->Templates;\n    HTMLTables-->Structure;\n    HTMLTables-->Rendering;\n    HTMLForms-->Creation;\n    HTMLForms-->Handling;\n    BandwidthLatency-->Bandwidth;\n    BandwidthLatency-->Latency;\n    RTT-->Calculation;\n    FlaskRoutes-->DefiningRoutes;\n    FlaskRoutes-->HandlingRoutes;\n    FlaskRequestHandling-->GETRequests;\n    FlaskRequestHandling-->POSTRequests;\n    Jinja2Templates-->TemplateRendering;\n    Jinja2Templates-->DynamicContent;\n```\n\nThese summaries and graphs should help you understand the core topics and their relationships, which are essential for the exam.",
