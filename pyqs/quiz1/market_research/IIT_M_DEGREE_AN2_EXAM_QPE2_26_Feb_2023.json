Involves multiple stages of sampling.\n- **Stratified Sampling**: Divides the population into subgroups (strata) and samples from each stratum.\n- **Quota Sampling**: Non-random sampling where the researcher selects participants based on specific quotas.\n- **Systematic Sampling**: Selects participants at regular intervals from a list.\n- **Convenience Sampling**: Selects participants based on ease of access.\n\n#### 2. Sample Size Determination\n- **Sample Size for Mean Estimation**:\n  \\[\n  n = \\left( \\frac{Z \\cdot \\sigma}{E} \\right)^2\n  \\]\n  where \\( Z \\) is the Z-score, \\( \\sigma \\) is the standard deviation, and \\( E \\) is the margin of error.\n\n- **Sample Size for Proportion Estimation**:\n  \\[\n  n = \\frac{Z^2 \\cdot p \\cdot (1-p)}{E^2}\n  \\]\n  where \\( p \\) is the estimated proportion.\n\n#### 3. Socio-Economic Classification (SEC)\n- **SEC Grid**: Used to classify households based on occupation and education level.\n- **Key Factors**: Occupation, education level, and income sources.\n\n#### 4. Questionnaire Design and Scales\n- **Close-Ended Questions**: Provide specific response options.\n- **Open-Ended Questions**: Allow respondents to answer in their own words.\n- **Balanced vs. Unbalanced Scales**: Balanced scales have an equal number of positive and negative options; unbalanced scales do not.\n- **Mid-Point in Scales**: Encourages neutral responses.\n- **Translation of Questionnaires**: Ensuring accurate translation for cross-cultural research.\n\n#### 5. Qualitative Research\n- **Group Discussions**: Used for exploring opinions and attitudes.\n- **Depth Interviews**: One-on-one interviews for in-depth insights.\n- **Laddering Technique**: Used to understand the underlying reasons for consumer choices.\n- **Projective Techniques**: Methods to uncover subconscious beliefs and attitudes.\n- **Moderator Role**: Facilitates discussions and ensures all topics are covered.\n\n### Mermaid Knowledge Graph\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Market Research] --> B[Sampling Methods]\n    A --> C[Sample Size Determination]\n    A --> D[Socio-Economic Classification]\n    A --> E[Questionnaire Design]\n    A --> F[Qualitative Research]\n\n    B --> B1[Multistage Cluster Sampling]\n    B --> B2[Stratified Sampling]\n    B --> B3[Quota Sampling]\n    B --> B4[Systematic Sampling]\n    B --> B5[Convenience Sampling]\n\n    C --> C1[Mean Estimation]\n    C --> C2[Proportion Estimation]\n\n    D --> D1[SEC Grid]\n    D --> D2[Occupation]\n    D --> D3[Education Level]\n\n    E --> E1[Close-Ended Questions]\n    E --> E2[Open-Ended Questions]\n    E --> E3[Balanced Scales]\n    E --> E4[Unbalanced Scales]\n    E --> E5[Translation]\n\n    F --> F1[Group Discussions]\n    F --> F2[Depth Interviews]\n    F --> F3[Laddering Technique]\n    F --> F4[Projective Techniques]\n    F --> F5[Moderator Role]\n```\n\nThis summary and knowledge graph should help you focus on the essential topics and concepts for your exam in Market Research.",
