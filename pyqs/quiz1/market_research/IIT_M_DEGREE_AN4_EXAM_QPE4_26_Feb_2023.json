**Stratified Sampling**: Divides the population into subgroups (strata) and samples from each stratum.\n   - **Quota Sampling**: Non-probability sampling where the sample is selected based on predefined quotas.\n   - **Systematic Sampling**: Selects every kth element from a list.\n   - **Convenience Sampling**: Uses subjects who are conveniently available.\n\n2. **Sample Size Determination**\n   - **Confidence Intervals**: Used to determine the sample size based on the desired level of confidence and margin of error.\n   - **Mean and Proportion**: Different formulas are used for estimating sample sizes based on whether the key metric is a mean or a proportion.\n\n3. **Socio-Economic Classification (SEC)**\n   - **Grid Analysis**: Uses a grid to classify households based on occupation and education level.\n   - **Chief Wage Earner**: The primary earner in a household.\n   - **Householder/Housewife**: The person responsible for managing the household.\n\n4. **Questionnaire Design and Scales**\n   - **Close-Ended Questions**: Provide predefined options for respondents.\n   - **Open-Ended Questions**: Allow respondents to answer in their own words.\n   - **Balanced and Unbalanced Scales**: Balanced scales have an equal number of positive and negative options, while unbalanced scales do not.\n   - **Mid-Point in Scales**: Encourages respondents to choose a neutral option.\n   - **Translation of Questionnaires**: Ensuring accurate translation for multilingual surveys.\n\n5. **Qualitative Research**\n   - **Group Discussions**: Used for exploring opinions and attitudes.\n   - **Depth Interviews**: One-on-one interviews for in-depth insights.\n   - **Laddering Technique**: Used to understand the underlying reasons for consumer preferences.\n   - **Moderator**: A skilled individual who facilitates group discussions or depth interviews.\n   - **Projective Techniques**: Methods to uncover hidden or subconscious attitudes.\n   - **High Involvement Categories**: Products or services that require significant consumer involvement.\n   - **Convenience Sampling**: Often used in qualitative research for practical reasons.\n\n#### Important Equations\n\n1. **Sample Size for Mean**\n   \\[\n   n = \\left( \\frac{Z \\cdot \\sigma}{E} \\right)^2\n   \\]\n   - \\( n \\): Sample size\n   - \\( Z \\): Z-score corresponding to the desired confidence level\n   - \\( \\sigma \\): Standard deviation\n   - \\( E \\): Margin of error\n\n2. **Sample Size for Proportion**\n   \\[\n   n = \\frac{Z^2 \\cdot p \\cdot (1-p)}{E^2}\n   \\]\n   - \\( n \\): Sample size\n   - \\( Z \\): Z-score corresponding to the desired confidence level\n   - \\( p \\): Estimated proportion\n   - \\( E \\): Margin of error\n\n### Knowledge Graph \n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[Market Research] --> B[Sampling Methods];\n    A --> C[Sample Size Determination];\n    A --> D[Socio-Economic Classification];\n    A --> E[Questionnaire Design];\n    A --> F[Qualitative Research];\n\n    B --> B1[Multistage Cluster Sampling];\n    B --> B2[Stratified Sampling];\n    B --> B3[Quota Sampling];\n    B --> B4[Systematic Sampling];\n    B --> B5[Convenience Sampling];\n\n    C --> C1[Confidence Intervals];\n    C --> C2[Mean and Proportion];\n\n    D --> D1[Grid Analysis];\n    D --> D2[Chief Wage Earner];\n    D --> D3[Householder/Housewife];\n\n    E --> E1[Close-Ended Questions];\n    E --> E2[Open-Ended Questions];\n    E --> E3[Balanced and Unbalanced Scales];\n    E --> E4[Mid-Point in Scales];\n    E --> E5[Translation of Questionnaires];\n\n    F --> F1[Group Discussions];\n    F --> F2[Depth Interviews];\n    F --> F3[Laddering Technique];\n    F --> F4[Moderator];\n    F --> F5[Projective Techniques];\n    F --> F6[High Involvement Categories];\n    F --> F7[Convenience Sampling];\n```\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    G[Sampling Methods] --> H[Multistage Cluster Sampling];\n    G --> I[Stratified Sampling];\n    G --> J[Quota Sampling];\n    G --> K[Systematic Sampling];\n    G --> L[Convenience Sampling];\n\n    M[Sample Size Determination] --> N[Confidence Intervals];\n    M --> O[Mean and Proportion];\n\n    P[Socio-Economic Classification] --> Q[Grid Analysis];\n    P --> R[Chief Wage Earner];\n    P --> S[Householder/Housewife];\n\n    T[Questionnaire Design] --> U[Close-Ended Questions];\n    T --> V[Open-Ended Questions];\n    T --> W[Balanced and Unbalanced Scales];\n    T --> X[Mid-Point in Scales];\n    T --> Y[Translation of Questionnaires];\n\n    Z[Qualitative Research] --> AA[Group Discussions];\n    Z --> AB[Depth Interviews];\n    Z --> AC[Laddering Technique];\n    Z --> AD[Moderator];\n    Z --> AE[Projective Techniques];\n    Z --> AF[High Involvement Categories];\n    Z --> AG[Convenience Sampling];\n```\n\nThis summary and knowledge graph should help you understand the core topics and their relationships for the exam on \"Degree Level: Market Research.\"",
