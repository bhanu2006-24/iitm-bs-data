Here is a summary of the core topics, concepts, principles, and equations:\n\n#### 1. **MP Neuron Model**\n- **Concept**: The McCulloch-Pitts (MP) neuron is a binary classifier.\n- **Principle**: It classifies inputs based on a threshold.\n- **Equation**:\n  \\[\n  y = \\begin{cases}\n  1, & \\text{if } \\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i x_i \\geq \\theta \\\\\n  0, & \\text{otherwise}\n  \\end{cases}\n  \\]\n  where \\( \\theta \\) is the threshold.\n\n#### 2. **Perceptron**\n- **Concept**: A type of linear classifier.\n- **Principle**: Uses a decision rule based on weights and a threshold.\n- **Equation**:\n  \\[\n  y = \\begin{cases}\n  1, & \\text{if } w^T x_i \\geq 0 \\\\\n  0, & \\text{if } w^T x_i < 0\n  \\end{cases}\n  \\]\n\n#### 3. **Logistic Sigmoid Neuron**\n- **Concept**: A neuron with a sigmoid activation function.\n- **Principle**: Outputs a value between 0 and 1.\n- **Equation**:\n  \\[\n  \\sigma(x) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(-(wx + b))}\n  \\]\n  where \\( w \\) and \\( b \\) are learnable parameters.\n\n#### 4. **Mean Square Error (MSE) Loss**\n- **Concept**: A common loss function for regression tasks.\n- **Equation**:\n  \\[\n  L = 0.5 \\times (\\hat{y} - y)^2\n  \\]\n\n#### 5. **Feed-Forward Neural Networks**\n- **Concept**: A type of artificial neural network where connections between the nodes do not form a cycle.\n- **Principle**: Information moves in one direction, from the input nodes, through the hidden nodes (if any), to the output nodes.\n- **Activation Functions**:\n  - **Logistic Function**: Used in hidden layers.\n  - **Softmax Function**: Used in the output layer for classification tasks.\n- **Loss Function**: Cross-entropy loss.\n\n#### 6. **Cross-Entropy Loss**\n- **Concept**: A loss function used for classification tasks.\n- **Equation**:\n  \\[\n  L = -\\sum_{i=1}^{C} y_i \\log(\\hat{y}_i)\n  \\]\n  where \\( C \\) is the number of classes, \\( y_i \\) is the true label, and \\( \\hat{y}_i \\) is the predicted probability.\n\n#### 7. **Gradient Descent and Backpropagation**\n- **Concept**: Optimization algorithms for training neural networks.\n- **Principle**: Update weights to minimize the loss function.\n- **Equation**:\n  \\[\n  w = w - \\eta \\nabla L\n  \\]\n  where \\( \\eta \\) is the learning rate and \\( \\nabla L \\) is the gradient of the loss function.\n\n#### 8. **Mini-Batch Gradient Descent**\n- **Concept**: A variant of gradient descent where the batch size is more than one but less than the entire dataset.\n- **Principle**: Update weights using a subset of the data (mini-batch) in each iteration.\n- **Equation**:\n  \\[\n  w = w - \\eta \\nabla L_{\\text{batch}}\n  \\]\n  where \\( \\nabla L_{\\text{batch}} \\) is the gradient of the loss function for the mini-batch.\n\n### Knowledge Graph \n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[Deep Learning] --> B[MP Neuron Model];\n    A --> C[Perceptron];\n    A --> D[Logistic Sigmoid Neuron];\n    A --> E[Feed-Forward Neural Networks];\n    A --> F[Loss Functions];\n    A --> G[Optimization Algorithms];\n\n    B --> B1[Threshold Classification];\n    C --> C1[Decision Rule];\n    D --> D1[Sigmoid Activation];\n    E --> E1[Logistic Function];\n    E --> E2[Softmax Function];\n    E --> E3[Cross-Entropy Loss];\n    F --> F1[Mean Square Error Loss];\n    F --> F2[Cross-Entropy Loss];\n    G --> G1[Gradient Descent];\n    G --> G2[Backpropagation];\n    G --> G3[Mini-Batch Gradient Descent];\n```\n\nThis knowledge graph visually maps the relationships between the core topics in deep learning as covered in the exam questions.",
