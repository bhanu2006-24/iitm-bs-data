K-Means Clustering\n- **Concepts**:\n  - **K-Means Algorithm**: Iterative algorithm that partitions data into K clusters.\n  - **Convergence**: The algorithm converges when the assignments of data points to clusters no longer change.\n  - **Global Minimum**: K-Means does not guarantee finding the global minimum; it often finds a local minimum.\n- **Key Points**:\n  - The number of clusters (K) is fixed and does not change during the algorithm.\n  - K-Means is sensitive to the initial placement of centroids.\n\n#### 2. Gaussian Distribution\n- **Concepts**:\n  - **Uni-variate Gaussian Distribution**: Defined by mean (\\(\\mu\\)) and variance (\\(\\sigma^2\\)).\n  - **Parameters**: Mean and variance completely define a uni-variate Gaussian distribution.\n- **Equations**:\n  \\[\n  p(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2}} e^{-\\frac{(x-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}}\n  \\]\n\n#### 3. Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)\n- **Concepts**:\n  - **GMM**: A probabilistic model that assumes all the data points are generated from a mixture of a finite number of Gaussian distributions.\n  - **EM Algorithm**: Used to estimate the parameters of the GMM (means, variances, and mixture proportions).\n- **Equations**:\n  \\[\n  p(x) = \\sum_{i=1}^{K} \\pi_i N(\\mu_i, \\sigma_i)\n  \\]\n  where \\(\\pi_i\\) are the mixture proportions, \\(\\mu_i\\) are the means, and \\(\\sigma_i\\) are the variances of the Gaussian components.\n\n#### 4. Sequence Prediction\n- **Concepts**:\n  - **Greedy Approach**: Makes the locally optimal choice at each stage with the intent of finding a global optimum.\n  - **Viterbi Algorithm**: Finds the most likely sequence of hidden states (the Viterbi path) that results in a sequence of observed events.\n- **Key Points**:\n  - **First-order Markov Chain**: The probability of moving to the next state depends only on the current state.\n  - **Transition Probabilities**: Used to predict the next state in the sequence.\n\n#### 5. Vector Quantization\n- **Concepts**:\n  - **K-Means for Vector Quantization**: Partitions data into K clusters and uses the centroids as codewords.\n  - **Linde-Buzo-Gray (LBG) Algorithm**: A variant of K-Means specifically designed for vector quantization, often used in speech and image compression.\n- **Key Points**:\n  - **Clustering Mechanism**: Both algorithms aim to minimize the distortion between the data points and the codewords.\n  - **Differences**: LBG algorithm typically starts with a single cluster and iteratively splits the clusters, whereas K-Means starts with a predefined number of clusters.\n\n#### 6. Sampling Theorem\n- **Concepts**:\n  - **Nyquist-Shannon Sampling Theorem**: For perfect reconstruction of a bandlimited signal, the sampling frequency must be at least twice the highest frequency component of the signal.\n- **Equations**:\n  \\[\n  f_s \\geq 2B\n  \\]\n  where \\(f_s\\) is the sampling frequency and \\(B\\) is the bandwidth of the signal.\n\n### Knowledge Graph \n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[K-Means Clustering] --> B[Fixed K]\n    A --> C[Convergence]\n    A --> D[Local Minimum]\n    E[Gaussian Distribution] --> F[Mean and Variance]\n    G[Gaussian Mixture Model] --> H[EM Algorithm]\n    G --> I[Mixture Proportions]\n    J[Sequence Prediction] --> K[Greedy Approach]\n    J --> L[Viterbi Algorithm]\n    M[Vector Quantization] --> N[K-Means]\n    M --> O[LBG Algorithm]\n    P[Sampling Theorem] --> Q[Nyquist-Shannon]\n```\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[Clustering] --> B[K-Means]\n    A --> C[GMM]\n    B --> D[Fixed K]\n    B --> E[Convergence]\n    C --> F[EM Algorithm]\n    C --> G[Mixture Proportions]\n    H[Sequence Prediction] --> I[Greedy Approach]\n    H --> J[Viterbi Algorithm]\n    K[Vector Quantization] --> L[K-Means]\n    K --> M[LBG Algorithm]\n    N[Sampling] --> O[Nyquist-Shannon]\n```\n\nThis summary and the knowledge graphs should help you understand the core topics and their relationships for the exam.",
