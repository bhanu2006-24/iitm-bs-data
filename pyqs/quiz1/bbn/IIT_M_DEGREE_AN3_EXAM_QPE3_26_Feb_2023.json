        "summary": "### Summary of Core Topics, Concepts, Principles, and Equations\n\n#### 1. **Functional Genomics Approaches**\n- **Epigenomics**: Study of how histone methylation regulates gene expression.\n- **RNA-Seq**: Used for measuring gene expression and identifying novel transcripts.\n- **Microarray Analysis**: Used for measuring gene expression but less effective for novel transcript identification.\n- **Real-time PCR**: Used for precise quantification of gene expression.\n- **ChIP-seq**: Used for analyzing protein-DNA interactions.\n\n#### 2. **DNA Sequencing Methods**\n- **Sanger Sequencing**: Uses dideoxynucleotide triphosphates (ddNTPs) which lack a hydroxyl group on the 3' carbon, preventing further polymerization.\n- **Illumina Sequencing**: Short fragment reads (100-150 bp) are ligated to the flow cell surface; can sequence hundreds to thousands of genes simultaneously.\n- **Nanopore Sequencing**: Long read sequencing technique with high accuracy; uses change in current in protein nanopores when DNA is passed through.\n\n#### 3. **Graph Theory and Network Analysis**\n- **Eulerian Path**: A connected graph has an Eulerian path if it has zero or two vertices with odd degrees.\n- **Graph Density**: Measure of how close a graph is to being complete. Density = (2 * number of edges) / (number of nodes * (number of nodes - 1)).\n- **Regular Graph**: A graph where each vertex has the same number of neighbors (same degree).\n- **Connected Components**: Subgraphs in which any two vertices are connected by a path.\n- **Complete Bipartite Graph**: A graph with two sets of vertices where every vertex in one set is connected to every vertex in the other set.\n- **Adjacency Matrix**: A square matrix used to represent a finite graph. The elements of the matrix indicate whether pairs of vertices are adjacent or not.\n- **Betweenness Centrality**: Measure of the importance of a node in a network, calculated as the number of shortest paths that pass through the node.\n- **Clustering Coefficient**: Measure of the degree to which nodes in a graph tend to cluster together.\n\n#### 4. **Biological Networks**\n- **Metabolic Network**: Represents the chemical reactions in a cell.\n- **Signaling Network**: Represents the interactions between signaling molecules.\n- **Citation Network**: Represents the citations between scientific papers.\n- **Social Networks**: Represents the interactions between individuals.\n\n#### 5. **Multi-omics Studies**\n- **Genomics**: Study of the entire genome of an organism.\n- **Transcriptomics**: Study of the complete set of RNA transcripts.\n- **Epigenomics**: Study of the complete set of epigenetic modifications.\n- **Proteomics**: Study of the complete set of proteins.\n- **Metabolomics**: Study of the complete set of metabolites.\n\n#### 6. **GWAS Studies**\n- **Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS)**: Used to identify genetic variants associated with specific traits or diseases.\n- **Statistical Association**: If a variant is found to be associated with a trait, it means that a variant in that genomic region may cause a difference in the trait.\n\n### Equations\n\n#### Graph Density\n\\[ \\text{Density} = \\frac{2 \\times \\text{number of edges}}{\\text{number of nodes} \\times (\\text{number of nodes} - 1)} \\]\n\n#### Betweenness Centrality\n\\[ C_B(v) = \\sum_{s \\neq v \\neq t} \\frac{\\sigma_{st}(v)}{\\sigma_{st}} \\]\nwhere \\(\\sigma_{st}\\) is the total number of shortest paths from node \\(s\\) to node \\(t\\) and \\(\\sigma_{st}(v)\\) is the number of those paths that pass through \\(v\\).\n\n#### Clustering Coefficient\n\\[ C_i = \\frac{2 \\times \\text{number of triangles connected to node } i}{\\text{degree of node } i \\times (\\text{degree of node } i - 1)} \\]\n\n### Mermaid Knowledge Graphs\n\n#### Graph 1: Functional Genomics Approaches\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[Functional Genomics] --> B[Epigenomics];\n    A --> C[RNA-Seq];\n    A --> D[Microarray Analysis];\n    A --> E[Real-time PCR];\n    A --> F[ChIP-seq];\n```\n\n#### Graph 2: DNA Sequencing Methods\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[DNA Sequencing Methods] --> B[Sanger Sequencing];\n    A --> C[Illumina Sequencing];\n    A --> D[Nanopore Sequencing];\n```\n\n#### Graph 3: Graph Theory and Network Analysis\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[Graph Theory] --> B[Eulerian Path];\n    A --> C[Graph Density];\n    A --> D[Regular Graph];\n    A --> E[Connected Components];\n    A --> F[Complete Bipartite Graph];\n    A --> G[Adjacency Matrix];\n    A --> H[Betweenness Centrality];\n    A --> I[Clustering Coefficient];\n```\n\n#### Graph 4: Biological Networks\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[Biological Networks] --> B[Metabolic Network];\n    A --> C[Signaling Network];\n    A --> D[Citation Network];\n    A --> E[Social Networks];\n```\n\n#### Graph 5: Multi-omics Studies\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[Multi-omics Studies] --> B[Genomics];\n    A --> C[Transcriptomics];\n    A --> D[Epigenomics];\n    A --> E[Proteomics];\n    A --> F[Metabolomics];\n```\n\n#### Graph 6: GWAS Studies\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[GWAS Studies] --> B[Genetic Variants];\n    A --> C[Traits or Diseases];\n    A --> D[Statistical Association];\n```\n\nThese summaries and graphs should help you understand the core topics and their relationships, making it easier to prepare for the exam.",
