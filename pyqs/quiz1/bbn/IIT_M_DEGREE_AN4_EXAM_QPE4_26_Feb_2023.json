Functional Genomics and Sequencing Methods\n- **Functional Genomics Approaches**:\n  - **Epigenomics**: Study of histone methylation and gene expression.\n  - **Transcriptomics**: Study of RNA transcripts.\n  - **Metabolomics**: Study of metabolites.\n- **DNA Sequencing Methods**:\n  - **Sanger Sequencing**: Uses dideoxynucleotide triphosphates (ddNTPs) which lack a hydroxyl group on the 3' carbon.\n  - **Illumina Sequencing**: Uses reversible dye terminator technology.\n  - **Nanopore Sequencing**: Uses change in current in protein nanopores.\n- **RNA-Seq**: Used for measuring gene expression and identifying novel transcripts.\n\n#### 2. Graph Theory and Network Analysis\n- **Graph Types**:\n  - **Connected Graph**: A graph where there is a path between any two vertices.\n  - **Complete Graph**: A graph where every pair of distinct vertices is connected by a unique edge.\n  - **Bipartite Graph**: A graph whose vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets such that no two graph vertices within the same set are adjacent.\n  - **Regular Graph**: A graph where each vertex has the same number of neighbors.\n- **Graph Properties**:\n  - **Degree Distribution**: The probability distribution of the degrees of the graph.\n  - **Clustering Coefficient**: Measures the degree to which nodes in a graph tend to cluster together.\n  - **Betweenness Centrality**: Measures the extent to which a node lies on paths between other nodes.\n  - **Density**: The ratio of the number of edges to the number of possible edges.\n  - **Eulerian Path**: A path in a graph that visits every edge exactly once.\n- **Graph Matrices**:\n  - **Adjacency Matrix**: A square matrix used to represent a finite graph.\n  - **Number of Non-Zero Elements**: In an undirected graph, the number of non-zero elements in the adjacency matrix is always even.\n\n#### 3. Biological Networks\n- **Types of Biological Networks**:\n  - **Metabolic Networks**: Networks of chemical reactions in a cell.\n  - **Signaling Networks**: Networks of signaling molecules in a cell.\n  - **Protein-Protein Interaction Networks**: Networks of proteins interacting with each other.\n- **Multi-Omics Studies**: Combines genomic data with data from other modalities such as transcriptomics, epigenetics, and proteomics.\n\n#### 4. Probability and Statistics\n- **Erdos-Renyi Network**: A random graph model where each edge is included in the graph with probability p.\n- **Watts-Strogatz Network**: A random graph model that captures the small-world properties of real-world networks.\n- **Preferential Attachment Model**: A model where new nodes attach to existing nodes with a probability proportional to the degree of the existing nodes.\n\n#### 5. Equations and Formulas\n- **Density of a Graph**:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Density} = \\frac{2 \\times \\text{Number of Edges}}{\\text{Number of Nodes} \\times (\\text{Number of Nodes} - 1)}\n  \\]\n- **Average Degree of a Graph**:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Average Degree} = \\frac{2 \\times \\text{Number of Edges}}{\\text{Number of Nodes}}\n  \\]\n- **Clustering Coefficient of a Node**:\n  \\[\n  C_i = \\frac{2 \\times \\text{Number of Triangles involving node } i}{\\text{Number of Triples centered at node } i}\n  \\]\n- **Betweenness Centrality of a Node**:\n  \\[\n  C_B(v) = \\sum_{s \\neq v \\neq t} \\frac{\\sigma_{st}(v)}{\\sigma_{st}}\n  \\]\n  where \\(\\sigma_{st}\\) is the total number of shortest paths from node \\(s\\) to node \\(t\\) and \\(\\sigma_{st}(v)\\) is the number of those paths that pass through \\(v\\).\n\n### Mermaid Knowledge Graphs\n\n#### Graph 1: Functional Genomics and Sequencing Methods\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    FunctionalGenomics-->Epigenomics;\n    FunctionalGenomics-->Transcriptomics;\n    FunctionalGenomics-->Metabolomics;\n    DNASequencing-->SangerSequencing;\n    DNASequencing-->IlluminaSequencing;\n    DNASequencing-->NanoporeSequencing;\n    RNASeq-->GeneExpression;\n    RNASeq-->NovelTranscripts;\n```\n\n#### Graph 2: Graph Theory and Network Analysis\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    GraphTheory-->GraphTypes;\n    GraphTheory-->GraphProperties;\n    GraphTheory-->GraphMatrices;\n    GraphTypes-->ConnectedGraph;\n    GraphTypes-->CompleteGraph;\n    GraphTypes-->BipartiteGraph;\n    GraphTypes-->RegularGraph;\n    GraphProperties-->DegreeDistribution;\n    GraphProperties-->ClusteringCoefficient;\n    GraphProperties-->BetweennessCentrality;\n    GraphProperties-->Density;\n    GraphProperties-->EulerianPath;\n    GraphMatrices-->AdjacencyMatrix;\n    GraphMatrices-->NonZeroElements;\n```\n\n#### Graph 3: Biological Networks\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    BiologicalNetworks-->MetabolicNetworks;\n    BiologicalNetworks-->SignalingNetworks;\n    BiologicalNetworks-->ProteinProteinInteractionNetworks;\n    MultiOmics-->GenomicData;\n    MultiOmics-->Transcriptomics;\n    MultiOmics-->Epigenetics;\n    MultiOmics-->Proteomics;\n```\n\n#### Graph 4: Probability and Statistics\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    ProbabilityAndStatistics-->ErdosRenyiNetwork;\n    ProbabilityAndStatistics-->WattsStrogatzNetwork;\n    ProbabilityAndStatistics-->PreferentialAttachmentModel;\n```\n\nThese graphs provide a visual representation of the relationships between the core topics, concepts, and principles essential for the exam.",
