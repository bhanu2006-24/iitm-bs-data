A connected graph has an Eulerian path if it has zero or two vertices with odd degrees.\n- **Graph Density**: Measure of how close a graph is to being complete. Density = (2 * number of edges) / (number of nodes * (number of nodes - 1)).\n- **Connected Components**: Subgraphs where any two nodes are connected by a path.\n- **Complete Bipartite Graph**: A graph where every node in one group is connected to every node in another group.\n- **Regular Graph**: A graph where each node has the same number of neighbors.\n- **Watts-Strogatz Network**: Captures small-world properties and characteristic path length of real-world networks.\n- **Erdos-Renyi Network**: Random network model with a probability p for edge creation.\n- **Preferential Attachment Model**: New nodes attach to existing nodes with a probability proportional to the degree of the existing nodes.\n\n#### 5. **Network Metrics**\n- **Betweenness Centrality**: Measure of the number of shortest paths that pass through a node.\n- **Clustering Coefficient**: Measure of the degree to which nodes in a graph tend to cluster together.\n\n#### 6. **Biological Networks**\n- **Metabolic Networks**: Networks of chemical reactions in a cell.\n- **Signaling Networks**: Networks of molecular interactions involved in signal transduction.\n- **Citation Networks**: Networks of citations between scientific papers.\n- **Social Networks**: Networks of social interactions.\n\n#### 7. **Multi-omics Studies**\n- **Genomics**: Study of the genome.\n- **Transcriptomics**: Study of the transcriptome.\n- **Epigenomics**: Study of the epigenome.\n- **Proteomics**: Study of the proteome.\n- **Metabolomics**: Study of the metabolome.\n\n#### 8. **GWAS Studies**\n- **Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS)**: Test genetic variants across many genomes to find those statistically associated with a specific trait or disease.\n- **Genetic Profiling**: Predicting an individual\u2019s risk for physical and mental disease based on their genetic profile.\n\n#### 9. **Sequencing Technologies**\n- **Nanopore Sequencing**: Long read sequencing technique with high accuracy.\n- **Illumina Sequencing**: Short read sequencing technique using reversible dye terminator technology.\n\n### Equations\n\n#### Graph Theory\n1. **Graph Density**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Density} = \\frac{2 \\times \\text{number of edges}}{\\text{number of nodes} \\times (\\text{number of nodes} - 1)}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Betweenness Centrality**:\n   \\[\n   C_B(v) = \\sum_{s \\neq v \\neq t} \\frac{\\sigma_{st}(v)}{\\sigma_{st}}\n   \\]\n   where \\(\\sigma_{st}\\) is the number of shortest paths from node \\(s\\) to node \\(t\\), and \\(\\sigma_{st}(v)\\) is the number of those paths that pass through node \\(v\\).\n\n3. **Clustering Coefficient**:\n   \\[\n   C_i = \\frac{2 \\times \\text{number of triangles connected to node } i}{\\text{degree of node } i \\times (\\text{degree of node } i - 1)}\n   \\]\n\n### Mermaid Knowledge Graph\n\n#### Graph 1: Functional Genomics and Sequencing Methods\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    FunctionalGenomics-->Epigenomics;\n    FunctionalGenomics-->Transcriptomics;\n    FunctionalGenomics-->Metabolomics;\n    DNASequencing-->PCR;\n    DNASequencing-->SangerSequencing;\n    SangerSequencing-->ddNTPs;\n```\n\n#### Graph 2: Graph Theory Concepts\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    GraphTheory-->EulerianPath;\n    GraphTheory-->GraphDensity;\n    GraphTheory-->ConnectedComponents;\n    GraphTheory-->CompleteBipartiteGraph;\n    GraphTheory-->RegularGraph;\n    GraphTheory-->WattsStrogatzNetwork;\n    GraphTheory-->ErdosRenyiNetwork;\n    GraphTheory-->PreferentialAttachmentModel;\n    GraphTheory-->BetweennessCentrality;\n    GraphTheory-->ClusteringCoefficient;\n```\n\n#### Graph 3: Biological Networks and Multi-omics Studies\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    BiologicalNetworks-->MetabolicNetworks;\n    BiologicalNetworks-->SignalingNetworks;\n    MultiOmicsStudies-->Genomics;\n    MultiOmicsStudies-->Transcriptomics;\n    MultiOmicsStudies-->Epigenomics;\n    MultiOmicsStudies-->Proteomics;\n    MultiOmicsStudies-->Metabolomics;\n```\n\n#### Graph 4: GWAS and Sequencing Technologies\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    GWASStudies-->GeneticVariants;\n    GWASStudies-->GeneticProfiling;\n    SequencingTechnologies-->NanoporeSequencing;\n    SequencingTechnologies-->IlluminaSequencing;\n```\n\nThese graphs provide a visual representation of the relationships between the core topics, concepts, and principles essential for the exam.",
