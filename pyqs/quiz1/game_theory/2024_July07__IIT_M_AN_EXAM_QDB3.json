For a typical Hawk-Dove game there are resources to be gained (i.e. food, mates, territories, etc.) denoted as v. Each of two players can chooses to be aggressive, called \u201cHawk\u201d (H), or can be compromising, called \u201cDove\u201d (D). If both players choose H then they split the resources, but loose some payoff from injuries, denoted as k. Assume that k > v/2. If both choose D then they split the resources, but engage in some display of power that a display cost d, with d < v/2. Finally, if player i chooses H while j chooses D, then i gets all the resources while j leaves with no benefits and no costs. Describe the game as a game matrix and answer the following question.

For a typical Hawk-Dove game there are resources to be gained (i.e. food, mates, territories, etc.) denoted as v. Each of two players can chooses to be aggressive, called \u201cHawk\u201d (H), or can be compromising, called \u201cDove\u201d (D). If both players choose H then they split the resources, but loose some payoff from injuries, denoted as k. Assume that k > v/2. If both choose D then they split the resources, but engage in some display of power that a display cost d, with d < v/2.
