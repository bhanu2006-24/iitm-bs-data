        "summary": "### Summary of Core Topics, Concepts, Principles, and Equations\n\n#### Core Topics and Concepts\n\n1. **Game Theory Basics**\n   - **Players and Strategies**: Understanding the players involved and their possible strategies.\n   - **Payoffs**: The outcomes or rewards for each player based on the strategies chosen.\n   - **Game Matrix**: Representation of the game in matrix form showing payoffs for each combination of strategies.\n\n2. **Dominant Strategies**\n   - **Strictly Dominated Strategy**: A strategy that is always worse than some other strategy, no matter what the opponent does.\n   - **Iterated Elimination of Strictly Dominated Strategies (IESDS)**: Process of eliminating strictly dominated strategies iteratively to find potential Nash equilibria.\n\n3. **Nash Equilibrium**\n   - **Pure Strategy Nash Equilibrium**: A set of strategies, one for each player, where no player can benefit by changing their strategy while the other players keep theirs unchanged.\n   - **Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium**: A set of probability distributions over strategies for each player, where no player can benefit by changing their probability distribution.\n\n4. **Extensive Form Games**\n   - **Perfect Information**: Games where all players know the moves that have been made previously.\n   - **Terminal Nodes**: The end points of the game tree where the game ends.\n   - **Information Sets**: Collections of decision nodes where the player whose turn it is to move does not know which node in the set has been reached.\n   - **Pure Strategies**: Complete plans of action for a player, specifying what the player will do at each decision point.\n   - **Subgame Perfect Equilibrium**: A refinement of Nash equilibrium used in extensive form games, requiring that players' strategies are Nash equilibria in every subgame.\n\n5. **Hawk-Dove Game**\n   - **Resources and Costs**: Understanding the payoffs based on resources gained (v), cost of fighting (k), and cost of display (d).\n   - **Pure and Mixed Strategies**: Analyzing the equilibrium strategies in the context of the Hawk-Dove game.\n\n6. **Randomization Probabilities**\n   - **Calculating Probabilities**: Determining the probabilities of choosing different strategies in a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium.\n\n#### Important Equations\n\n1. **Payoff Calculation in Auction Game**\n   - For Player 1 and Player 2 bidding strategies, the payoff matrix can be represented as:\n     \\[\n     \\begin{array}{c|ccc}\n     & \\text{Bid 0} & \\text{Bid 1} & \\text{Bid 2} \\\\\n     \\hline\n     \\text{Bid 0} & (0, 0) & (0, 1) & (0, 2) \\\\\n     \\text{Bid 1} & (3, 0) & (1.5, 1.5) & (0, 2) \\\\\n     \\text{Bid 2} & (3, 0) & (3, 1) & (1, 1) \\\\\n     \\end{array}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Payoff Calculation in Hawk-Dove Game**\n   - For the Hawk-Dove game with resources \\( v \\), cost of fighting \\( k \\), and cost of display \\( d \\), the payoff matrix can be represented as:\n     \\[\n     \\begin{array}{c|cc}\n     & H & D \\\\\n     \\hline\n     H & \\left(\\frac{v}{2} - k, \\frac{v}{2} - k\\right) & (v, 0) \\\\\n     D & (0, v) & \\left(\\frac{v}{2} - d, \\frac{v}{2} - d\\right) \\\\\n     \\end{array}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Randomization Probabilities in Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium**\n   - For the drug dealer and police officer game, the randomization probabilities can be calculated as follows:\n     - Let \\( p \\) be the probability that the police officer patrols the street.\n     - Let \\( q \\) be the probability that the drug dealer chooses the street.\n     - The expected payoffs can be set equal to each other to find the equilibrium probabilities.\n\n### Knowledge Graph \n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[Game Theory] --> B[Players and Strategies];\n    A --> C[Payoffs];\n    A --> D[Game Matrix];\n    B --> E[Dominant Strategies];\n    E --> F[Strictly Dominated Strategy];\n    E --> G[Iterated Elimination of Strictly Dominated Strategies];\n    A --> H[Nash Equilibrium];\n    H --> I[Pure Strategy Nash Equilibrium];\n    H --> J[Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium];\n    A --> K[Extensive Form Games];\n    K --> L[Perfect Information];\n    K --> M[Terminal Nodes];\n    K --> N[Information Sets];\n    K --> O[Pure Strategies];\n    K --> P[Subgame Perfect Equilibrium];\n    A --> Q[Hawk-Dove Game];\n    Q --> R[Resources and Costs];\n    Q --> S[Pure and Mixed Strategies];\n    A --> T[Randomization Probabilities];\n    T --> U[Calculating Probabilities];\n```\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    B[Players and Strategies] --> C[Payoffs];\n    B --> D[Game Matrix];\n    C --> E[Dominant Strategies];\n    E --> F[Strictly Dominated Strategy];\n    E --> G[Iterated Elimination of Strictly Dominated Strategies];\n    C --> H[Nash Equilibrium];\n    H --> I[Pure Strategy Nash Equilibrium];\n    H --> J[Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium];\n    D --> K[Extensive Form Games];\n    K --> L[Perfect Information];\n    K --> M[Terminal Nodes];\n    K --> N[Information Sets];\n    K --> O[Pure Strategies];\n    K --> P[Subgame Perfect Equilibrium];\n    D --> Q[Hawk-Dove Game];\n    Q --> R[Resources and Costs];\n    Q --> S[Pure and Mixed Strategies];\n    H --> T[Randomization Probabilities];\n    T --> U[Calculating Probabilities];\n```\n\nThese graphs visually map the relationships between the core topics in Game Theory, highlighting the connections between different concepts and principles.",
