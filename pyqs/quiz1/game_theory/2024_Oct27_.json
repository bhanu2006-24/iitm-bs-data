A drug dealer in a neighborhood can work his trade either on a street corner or in the park. Each day, he decides where to set up shop, knowing that word about his location will travel among users. Because a good snitch is lacking, word does not travel to the police. The police officer on the beat then needs to decide whether she will patrol the park or the street corner, while not knowing where the drug dealer is hanging out that day. The decision of the officer and the dealer determine the extent of drug trades that day. Let suppose the total number of potential trades in the market is 100. A dealer's payoff is determined by the number of trades he consummates, while the officer\u2019s payoff is based on the number of trades she disrupts.

A drug dealer in a neighborhood can work his trade either on a street corner or in the park. Each day, he decides where to set up shop, knowing that word about his location will travel among users. Because a good snitch is lacking, word does not travel to the police. The police officer on the beat then needs to decide whether she will patrol the park or the street corner, while not knowing where the drug dealer is hanging out that day. The decision of the officer and the dealer determine the extent of drug trades that day. Let suppose the total number of potential trades in the market is 100. A dealer's payoff is determined by the number of trades he consummates, while the officer\u2019s payoff is based on the number of trades she disrupts.
