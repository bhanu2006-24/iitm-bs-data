For a typical Hawk-Dove game there are resources to be gained (i.e. food, mates, territories, etc.) denoted as v. Each of two players can chooses to be aggressive, called \u201cHawk\u201d (H), or can be compromising, called \u201cDove\u201d (D). If both players choose H then they split the resources, but loose some payoff from injuries, denoted as k. Assume that k > v/2. If both choose D then they split the resources, but engage in some display of power that a display cost d, with d < v/2.

For a typical Hawk-Dove game there are resources to be gained (i.e. food, mates, territories, etc.) denoted as v. Each of two players can chooses to be aggressive, called \u201cHawk\u201d (H), or can be compromising, called \u201cDove\u201d (D). If both players choose H then they split the resources, but loose some payoff from injuries, denoted as k. Assume that k > v/2. If both choose D then they split the resources, but engage in some display of power that a display cost d, with d < v/2.

For example, if a player has two strategies, A and B, a mixed strategy could be:\n\n\\[\n\\sigma = p \\cdot A + (1-p) \\cdot B\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(p\\) is the probability of choosing strategy A.\n\n#### Subgame Perfect Equilibrium\nA strategy profile is a subgame perfect equilibrium if it is a Nash equilibrium in every subgame of the extensive form game.\n\n### Mermaid Knowledge Graph\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[Game Theory] --> B[Players and Strategies];\n    A --> C[Payoff Matrices];\n    A --> D[Nash Equilibrium];\n    A --> E[Dominant Strategies];\n    A --> F[Pure and Mixed Strategies];\n    A --> G[Extensive Form Games];\n    A --> H[Applications and Examples];\n\n    B --> B1[Player 1];\n    B --> B2[Player 2];\n\n    C --> C1[Simultaneous Move Games];\n    C --> C2[Sequential Move Games];\n\n    D --> D1[Pure Strategies];\n    D --> D2[Mixed Strategies];\n\n    E --> E1[Strictly Dominated Strategies];\n    E --> E2[Iterated Elimination of Strictly Dominated Strategies];\n\n    G --> G1[Game Trees];\n    G --> G2[Information Sets];\n    G --> G3[Terminal Nodes];\n    G --> G4[Subgame Perfect Equilibrium];\n\n    H --> H1[Auction Games];\n    H --> H2[Hawk-Dove Game];\n    H --> H3[Drug Dealer and Police Officer Game];\n```\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    I[Extensive Form Game] --> J[Game Tree];\n    I --> K[Information Sets];\n    I --> L[Terminal Nodes];\n    I --> M[Subgame Perfect Equilibrium];\n\n    J --> J1[Player 1's Moves];\n    J --> J2[Player 2's Moves];\n\n    K --> K1[Information Set 1];\n    K --> K2[Information Set 2];\n\n    L --> L1[Terminal Node 1];\n    L --> L2[Terminal Node 2];\n\n    M --> M1[Nash Equilibrium in Subgames];\n```\n\nThese graphs visually map the relationships between the core topics in game theory, providing a clear and easy-to-understand format.",
