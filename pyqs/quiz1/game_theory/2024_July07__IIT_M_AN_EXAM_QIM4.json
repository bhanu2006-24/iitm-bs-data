For a typical Hawk-Dove game there are resources to be gained (i.e. food, mates, territories, etc.) denoted as v. Each of two players can chooses to be aggressive, called \u201cHawk\u201d (H), or can be compromising, called \u201cDove\u201d (D). If both players choose H then they split the resources, but loose some payoff from injuries, denoted as k. Assume that k > v/2. If both choose D then they split the resources, but engage in some display of power that a display cost d, with d < v/2. Finally, if player i chooses H while j chooses D, then i gets all the resources while j leaves with no benefits and no costs. Describe the game as a game matrix and answer the following question.

For a typical Hawk-Dove game there are resources to be gained (i.e. food, mates, territories, etc.) denoted as v. Each of two players can chooses to be aggressive, called \u201cHawk\u201d (H), or can be compromising, called \u201cDove\u201d (D). If both players choose H then they split the resources, but loose some payoff from injuries, denoted as k. Assume that k > v/2. If both choose D then they split the resources, but engage in some display of power that a display cost d, with d < v/2.

The expected payoffs must be equal for both strategies for each player.\n\nFor Player 1:\n\\[\nE[U_1(\\text{Strategy 1})] = E[U_1(\\text{Strategy 2})]\n\\]\n\nFor Player 2:\n\\[\nE[U_2(\\text{Strategy 1})] = E[U_2(\\text{Strategy 2})]\n\\]\n\n#### Subgame Perfect Equilibrium\nA strategy profile \\( s^* \\) is a subgame perfect equilibrium if it is a Nash equilibrium in every subgame of the extensive form game.\n\n### Knowledge Graph \n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[Game Theory] --> B[Players and Strategies];\n    A --> C[Payoff Matrix];\n    A --> D[Nash Equilibrium];\n    B --> E[Simultaneous Move Games];\n    B --> F[Sequential Move Games];\n    B --> G[Extensive Form Games];\n    D --> H[Pure Strategies];\n    D --> I[Mixed Strategies];\n    D --> J[Subgame Perfect Equilibrium];\n    A --> K[Dominant Strategies];\n    K --> L[Strictly Dominant Strategy];\n    K --> M[Iterated Elimination of Strictly Dominated Strategies];\n    A --> N[Applications];\n    N --> O[Auctions];\n    N --> P[Evolutionary Biology];\n    N --> Q[Economic Scenarios];\n```\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[Hawk-Dove Game] --> B[Payoff Structure];\n    A --> C[Nash Equilibrium in Mixed Strategies];\n    B --> D[Hawk Strategy];\n    B --> E[Dove Strategy];\n    C --> F[Probability Calculations];\n```\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[Extensive Form Games] --> B[Terminal Nodes];\n    A --> C[Information Sets];\n    A --> D[Pure Strategies];\n    A --> E[Subgame Perfect Equilibrium];\n    B --> F[Payoff Assignments];\n    C --> G[Decision Nodes];\n    D --> H[Complete Plans of Action];\n    E --> I[Nash Equilibrium in Subgames];\n```\n\nThese graphs and summaries should help you understand the core topics, concepts, principles, and equations essential for the exam.",
