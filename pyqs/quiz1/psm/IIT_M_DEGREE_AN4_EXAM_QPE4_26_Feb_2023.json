        "summary": "### Summary of Core Topics, Concepts, Principles, and Equations\n\n#### Core Topics and Concepts\n\n1. **Tokenization**\n   - **Definition**: The process of breaking down text into smaller units such as words, phrases, symbols, or other meaningful elements called tokens.\n   - **Importance**: Essential for natural language processing (NLP) tasks.\n\n2. **Word Representations**\n   - **Contextual Representations**: Understanding that the meaning of a word can change based on context.\n   - **Example**: The word \"Apple\" can refer to a fruit or a company, depending on the sentence.\n\n3. **Time Frequency Graph Analysis**\n   - **Potential Errors**: Unusual activity patterns can be due to time zone differences, bots, or data collection errors.\n\n4. **Unique IDs in Social Media**\n   - **Tweet ID vs. Reddit Post ID**: Understanding the unique identification systems used by different social media platforms.\n\n5. **API Requests**\n   - **GET Requests**: Constructing API requests to fetch specific data from social media platforms like Reddit.\n   - **Example**: Fetching Reddit submissions with specific keywords, dates, and comment counts.\n\n6. **Scale-Free Networks**\n   - **Definition**: Networks where the degree distribution follows a power law, meaning a few nodes have a very high degree (connections) while most nodes have a low degree.\n   - **Examples**: Social networks, the World Wide Web.\n\n7. **Word2Vec**\n   - **Architecture**: Understanding the neural network architecture used in Word2Vec.\n   - **Improvements over Bag-of-Words and TF-IDF**: Word2Vec captures semantic meaning and contextual information better than traditional methods.\n\n8. **News Veracity**\n   - **Factors to Consider**: Source credibility, cross-verification, author reputation, date of publication, and supporting evidence.\n\n9. **Reddit Components and Actions**\n   - **Components**: Subreddits, posts, comments, users, moderators.\n   - **Actions**: Posting, commenting, upvoting, downvoting, moderating.\n\n10. **Bag-of-Words (BoW) and TF-IDF**\n    - **BoW**: Represents text as a bag of its words, disregarding grammar and word order but keeping multiplicity.\n    - **TF-IDF**: Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency, a numerical statistic used to reflect how important a word is to a document in a collection or corpus.\n\n11. **Betweenness Centrality**\n    - **Definition**: A measure of the importance of a node in a network, calculated as the number of shortest paths that pass through the node.\n    - **Calculation**: Involves understanding the network structure and applying specific formulas to determine centrality.\n\n#### Equations\n\n1. **Bag-of-Words (BoW)**\n   - **Representation**: Typically a vector where each dimension corresponds to a word in the vocabulary, and the value is the count of that word in the document.\n   - **Example**:\n     - Sentence 1: \"welcome to the quiz\" \u2192 [\"welcome\": 1, \"to\": 1, \"the\": 1, \"quiz\": 1]\n     - Sentence 2: \"the quiz is 1 hour long\" \u2192 [\"the\": 1, \"quiz\": 1, \"is\": 1, \"1\": 1, \"hour\": 1, \"long\": 1]\n\n2. **TF-IDF**\n   - **Term Frequency (TF)**: \\( \\text{TF}(t, d) = \\frac{\\text{Number of times term } t \\text{ appears in document } d}{\\text{Total number of terms in document } d} \\)\n   - **Inverse Document Frequency (IDF)**: \\( \\text{IDF}(t, D) = \\log \\frac{\\text{Total number of documents}}{\\text{Number of documents containing term } t} \\)\n   - **TF-IDF**: \\( \\text{TF-IDF}(t, d, D) = \\text{TF}(t, d) \\times \\text{IDF}(t, D) \\)\n\n3. **Betweenness Centrality**\n   - **Formula**: \\( C_B(v) = \\sum_{s \\neq v \\neq t} \\frac{\\sigma_{st}(v)}{\\sigma_{st}} \\)\n     - Where \\( \\sigma_{st} \\) is the total number of shortest paths from node \\( s \\) to node \\( t \\).\n     - \\( \\sigma_{st}(v) \\) is the number of those paths that pass through node \\( v \\).\n\n### Knowledge Graph \n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[Privacy & Security in Online Social Media] --> B[Tokenization];\n    A --> C[Word Representations];\n    A --> D[Time Frequency Graph Analysis];\n    A --> E[Unique IDs in Social Media];\n    A --> F[API Requests];\n    A --> G[Scale-Free Networks];\n    A --> H[Word2Vec];\n    A --> I[News Veracity];\n    A --> J[Reddit Components and Actions];\n    A --> K[Bag-of-Words and TF-IDF];\n    A --> L[Betweenness Centrality];\n\n    B --> M[Natural Language Processing];\n    C --> M;\n    H --> M;\n    K --> M;\n\n    D --> N[Data Analysis];\n    E --> N;\n    F --> N;\n\n    G --> O[Network Theory];\n    L --> O;\n\n    I --> P[Information Verification];\n    J --> Q[Social Media Platforms];\n```\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    M[Natural Language Processing] --> R[Tokenization];\n    M --> S[Word Representations];\n    M --> T[Word2Vec];\n    M --> U[Bag-of-Words and TF-IDF];\n\n    N[Data Analysis] --> V[Time Frequency Graph Analysis];\n    N --> W[Unique IDs in Social Media];\n    N --> X[API Requests];\n\n    O[Network Theory] --> Y[Scale-Free Networks];\n    O --> Z[Betweenness Centrality];\n\n    P[Information Verification] --> AA[News Veracity];\n\n    Q[Social Media Platforms] --> AB[Reddit Components and Actions];\n```\n\nThese graphs provide a visual representation of the relationships between the core topics, making it easier to understand how they interconnect within the subject of \"Privacy & Security in Online Social Media.\"",
