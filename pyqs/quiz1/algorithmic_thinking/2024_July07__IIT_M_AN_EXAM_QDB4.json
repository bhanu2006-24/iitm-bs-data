Number of unique codons: \\(4^n\\) where \\(n\\) is the length of the codon.\n  - For the alien world scenario: \\(5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 = 120\\) (since each nucleotide can occur exactly once in a codon).\n\n#### 2. **Gene Regulatory Networks (GRN)**\n- **Concepts**: Genes, adjacency matrix, regulation.\n- **Principles**: GRNs describe how genes regulate each other.\n- **Equations**:\n  - Number of genes regulating a specific gene \\(g_i\\): Sum of the entries in the column corresponding to \\(g_i\\) in the adjacency matrix.\n\n#### 3. **Genome Composition**\n- **Concepts**: Genome string, k-mers, cardinality of multisets.\n- **Principles**: The composition of a genome string can be analyzed by breaking it down into smaller substrings (k-mers).\n- **Equations**:\n  - Cardinality of the multi-set \\(\\text{COMPOSITION}_k(S)\\): \\( \\text{length}(S) - k + 1 \\).\n\n#### 4. **Genetic Code and Translation**\n- **Concepts**: RNA, codons, amino acids, translation.\n- **Principles**: The genetic code describes how RNA codons are translated into amino acids.\n- **Equations**:\n  - Probability of a codon starting with a specific nucleotide given an amino acid: \\( \\frac{\\text{Number of codons for the amino acid starting with the nucleotide}}{\\text{Total number of codons for the amino acid}} \\).\n\n#### 5. **Probability in GRN Paths**\n- **Concepts**: Receptors, genes, edge probabilities, path probabilities.\n- **Principles**: The probability of information transmission along a path in a GRN can be calculated by multiplying the edge probabilities.\n- **Equations**:\n  - Path probability: \\( P = \\prod_{i=1}^{n} P_i \\), where \\(P_i\\) are the edge probabilities.\n\n#### 6. **Logistic Regression in Bioinformatics**\n- **Concepts**: Logistic regression, coefficients, log odds, binding efficiency.\n- **Principles**: Logistic regression is used to model the probability of a binary outcome based on predictor variables.\n- **Equations**:\n  - Log odds: \\( \\text{log odds} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2 + \\ldots + \\beta_n x_n \\).\n\n#### 7. **De Bruijn Graphs**\n- **Concepts**: De Bruijn graphs, k-mers, nodes, edges.\n- **Principles**: De Bruijn graphs are used in genome assembly to represent overlaps between sequences.\n- **Equations**:\n  - Number of nodes in a de Bruijn graph: \\( |S_{k-1}| \\), where \\(S_{k-1}\\) is the set of (k-1)-mers.\n\n#### 8. **Alignment of DNA Sequences**\n- **Concepts**: Global alignment, local alignment, scoring matrices, indels, mismatches.\n- **Principles**: Alignment involves matching sequences to identify regions of similarity.\n- **Equations**:\n  - Alignment score: \\( \\text{score} = \\#\\text{matches} - \\#\\text{indels} - 2 \\times \\#\\text{mismatches} \\).\n\n### Knowledge Graph \n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[Central Dogma] --> B[DNA]\n    A --> C[RNA]\n    A --> D[Amino Acids]\n    B --> E[Codons]\n    C --> E\n    E --> D\n    F[Gene Regulatory Networks] --> G[Genes]\n    F --> H[Adjacency Matrix]\n    G --> H\n    I[Genome Composition] --> J[Genome String]\n    I --> K[k-mers]\n    J --> K\n    L[Genetic Code] --> M[RNA]\n    L --> N[Codons]\n    L --> O[Amino Acids]\n    M --> N\n    N --> O\n    P[Probability in GRN Paths] --> Q[Receptors]\n    P --> R[Genes]\n    P --> S[Edge Probabilities]\n    Q --> R\n    R --> S\n    T[Logistic Regression] --> U[Coefficients]\n    T --> V[Log Odds]\n    T --> W[Binding Efficiency]\n    U --> V\n    V --> W\n    X[De Bruijn Graphs] --> Y[k-mers]\n    X --> Z[Nodes]\n    X --> AA[Edges]\n    Y --> Z\n    Z --> AA\n    AB[Alignment] --> AC[Global Alignment]\n    AB --> AD[Local Alignment]\n    AB --> AE[Scoring Matrices]\n    AC --> AE\n    AD --> AE\n```\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[Central Dogma] --> B[DNA]\n    A --> C[RNA]\n    A --> D[Amino Acids]\n    B --> E[Codons]\n    C --> E\n    E --> D\n```\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    F[Gene Regulatory Networks] --> G[Genes]\n    F --> H[Adjacency Matrix]\n    G --> H\n```\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    I[Genome Composition] --> J[Genome String]\n    I --> K[k-mers]\n    J --> K\n```\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    L[Genetic Code] --> M[RNA]\n    L --> N[Codons]\n    L --> O[Amino Acids]\n    M --> N\n    N --> O\n```\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    P[Probability in GRN Paths] --> Q[Receptors]\n    P --> R[Genes]\n    P --> S[Edge Probabilities]\n    Q --> R\n    R --> S\n```\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    T[Logistic Regression] --> U[Coefficients]\n    T --> V[Log Odds]\n    T --> W[Binding Efficiency]\n    U --> V\n    V --> W\n```\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    X[De Bruijn Graphs] --> Y[k-mers]\n    X --> Z[Nodes]\n    X --> AA[Edges]\n    Y --> Z\n    Z --> AA\n```\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    AB[Alignment] --> AC[Global Alignment]\n    AB --> AD[Local Alignment]\n    AB --> AE[Scoring Matrices]\n    AC --> AE\n    AD --> AE\n```\n\nThese graphs visually map the relationships between the core topics, making it easier to understand the connections and flow of concepts.",
