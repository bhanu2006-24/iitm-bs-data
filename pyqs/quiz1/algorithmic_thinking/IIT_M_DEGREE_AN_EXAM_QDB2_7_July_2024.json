k + 1\n  \\]\n  For \\( L = 30 \\) and \\( k = 4 \\):\n  \\[\n  30 - 4 + 1 = 27\n  \\]\n\n#### 4. **Genetic Code and Translation**\n- **Concept**: The genetic code is a set of rules by which information encoded in genetic material (DNA or RNA sequences) is translated into proteins.\n- **Principle**: Codons (triplets of nucleotides) correspond to specific amino acids.\n- **Example**: Translation of RNA strings into amino acid strings using the genetic code table.\n\n#### 5. **Probability in Genetic Code**\n- **Concept**: Calculating the probability of specific codons given an amino acid.\n- **Equation**: For Leucine (L), the probability that the codon starts with \"Uracil (U)\" is:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{\\text{Number of codons starting with U}}{\\text{Total number of codons for Leucine}} = \\frac{2}{6} \\approx 0.33\n  \\]\n\n#### 6. **Probability of Information Transmission**\n- **Concept**: Calculating the probability of information transmission along a path in a network.\n- **Equation**: For a path with edge probabilities \\( p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n \\), the overall probability is:\n  \\[\n  P = p_1 \\times p_2 \\times \\ldots \\times p_n\n  \\]\n  For the given problem:\n  \\[\n  P = 0.02 \\times 0.03 \\times 0.06 \\times 0.01 = 36 \\times 10^{-8}\n  \\]\n\n#### 7. **Probability of Colorful Paths**\n- **Concept**: Calculating the probability that a path is colorful in a random coloring of nodes.\n- **Equation**: For a path with \\( n \\) nodes and \\( c \\) colors, the probability is:\n  \\[\n  P = \\frac{c \\times (c-1)^{n-1}}{c^n}\n  \\]\n  For \\( c = 6 \\) and \\( n = 4 \\):\n  \\[\n  P = \\frac{6 \\times 5^3}{6^4} \\approx 0.09\n  \\]\n\n#### 8. **Logistic Regression**\n- **Concept**: A statistical method for analyzing datasets where the outcome variable is categorical.\n- **Equation**: The log odds of binding is given by:\n  \\[\n  \\text{log odds} = \\text{constant} + (\\text{Coefficient}_{\\text{length}} \\times \\text{length}) + (\\text{Coefficient}_{\\text{structure}} \\times \\text{structure}) + (\\text{Coefficient}_{\\text{HSC}} \\times \\text{HSC})\n  \\]\n  For the given problem:\n  \\[\n  \\text{log odds} = -25 + (0.9 \\times 20) + (0.3 \\times 0) + (2.5 \\times 1) = -4.5\n  \\]\n\n#### 9. **De Bruijn Graphs**\n- **Concept**: A directed graph representing overlaps between sequences of symbols.\n- **Principle**: Used in genome assembly to construct sequences from reads.\n- **Example**: Constructing a de Bruijn graph from a multiset of k-mers.\n\n#### 10. **Signaling Pathway Detection**\n- **Concept**: Increasing the number of colors in the color coding algorithm increases the probability of detecting the best scoring path and the running time.\n- **Principle**: The color coding algorithm is used to detect paths in signaling networks.\n\n#### 11. **Genome Assembly**\n- **Concept**: Assembling the sequence of a genome from reads.\n- **Principle**: Hamiltonian path approach is used in overlap graphs, and Eulerian path approach is used in de Bruijn graphs.\n- **Example**: Determining the number of nodes in a de Bruijn graph and assembling the genome sequence.\n\n#### 12. **Sequence Alignment**\n- **Concept**: Aligning two sequences to identify regions of similarity.\n- **Principle**: Global alignment involves aligning the entire sequences, while local alignment involves aligning smaller parts/substrings.\n- **Equation**: The alignment score is calculated based on matches, mismatches, and indels.\n  \\[\n  \\text{score} = \\#\\text{matches} - \\#\\text{indels} - 2 \\times \\#\\text{mismatches}\n  \\]\n\n### Mermaid Knowledge Graph\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[Central Dogma] -->|Involves| B[Genetic Code]\n    A -->|Involves| C[Translation]\n    B -->|Uses| D[Codons]\n    C -->|Uses| D\n    D -->|Represents| E[Amino Acids]\n    F[Gene Regulatory Networks] -->|Represents| G[Adjacency Matrix]\n    H[Genome Composition] -->|Calculates| I[Cardinality of k-mers]\n    J[Probability] -->|Calculates| K[Information Transmission]\n    J -->|Calculates| L[Colorful Paths]\n    M[Logistic Regression] -->|Predicts| N[Binding Efficiency]\n    O[De Bruijn Graphs] -->|Used in| P[Genome Assembly]\n    Q[Signaling Pathway Detection] -->|Uses| R[Color Coding Algorithm]\n    S[Sequence Alignment] -->|Involves| T[Global Alignment]\n    S -->|Involves| U[Local Alignment]\n```\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[Central Dogma] -->|Involves| B[Genetic Code]\n    A -->|Involves| C[Translation]\n    B -->|Uses| D[Codons]\n    C -->|Uses| D\n    D -->|Represents| E[Amino Acids]\n    F[Gene Regulatory Networks] -->|Represents| G[Adjacency Matrix]\n    H[Genome Composition] -->|Calculates| I[Cardinality of k-mers]\n    J[Probability] -->|Calculates| K[Information Transmission]\n    J -->|Calculates| L[Colorful Paths]\n    M[Logistic Regression] -->|Predicts| N[Binding Efficiency]\n```\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    O[De Bruijn Graphs] -->|Used in| P[Genome Assembly]\n    Q[Signaling Pathway Detection] -->|Uses| R[Color Coding Algorithm]\n    S[Sequence Alignment] -->|Involves| T[Global Alignment]\n    S -->|Involves| U[Local Alignment]\n```",
