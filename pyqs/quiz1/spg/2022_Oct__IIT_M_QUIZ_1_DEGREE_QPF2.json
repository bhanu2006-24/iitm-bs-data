She feels quite sure that senior managers don't feel inclined to change the existing methods, and are merely going through a ritual by making a short time allocation. She approaches you in an emotional and demoralized state. You have been her supervisor before. Though you work in a different part of the organization, she comes to you to be coached once in a while. What will you tell her?"
