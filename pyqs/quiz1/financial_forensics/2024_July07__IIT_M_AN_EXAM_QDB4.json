**Assets**: Resources owned by the company (e.g., cash, inventory, land, buildings).\n  - **Liabilities**: Obligations the company owes to others (e.g., loans, accounts payable).\n  - **Equity**: Owners' claim on the assets of the company.\n  - **Equation**: Assets = Liabilities + Equity\n\n- **Income Statement**: Shows the company's revenues and expenses over a period.\n  - **Revenues**: Income from sales and other sources.\n  - **Expenses**: Costs incurred to generate revenue (e.g., cost of goods sold, salaries, rent).\n  - **Equation**: Net Income = Revenues - Expenses\n\n- **Cash Flow Statement**: Tracks the flow of cash in and out of the company.\n  - **Operating Activities**: Cash flows from primary business activities.\n  - **Investing Activities**: Cash flows from the purchase and sale of long-term assets.\n  - **Financing Activities**: Cash flows from borrowing and repaying funds, issuing and buying back shares, and paying dividends.\n\n#### 2. **Partnership Accounting**\n- **Partnership Formation**: Initial contributions by partners can be in cash or other assets.\n- **Partnership Transactions**: Includes purchases, sales, withdrawals, and loans.\n- **Equation**: Cash Balance = Initial Cash + Cash Inflows - Cash Outflows\n\n#### 3. **Inventory and Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**\n- **Inventory**: Goods available for sale.\n- **COGS**: Direct costs attributable to the production of goods sold by a company.\n  - **Equation**: COGS = Beginning Inventory + Purchases - Ending Inventory\n\n#### 4. **Insurance Policies**\n- **Prepaid Insurance**: An asset representing the portion of the insurance premium that has not yet expired.\n- **Insurance Expense**: The portion of the prepaid insurance that has expired.\n  - **Equation**: Insurance Expense = Total Premium * (Number of Months Expired / Total Policy Duration)\n\n#### 5. **Cash Discounts**\n- **Cash Discount**: Reduction in the amount to be paid if payment is made within a specified period.\n  - **Equation**: Sale Value after Discount = Original Sale Value * (1 - Discount Percentage)\n\n#### 6. **Accrued Expenses**\n- **Accrued Expenses**: Expenses that have been incurred but not yet paid.\n  - **Equation**: Expenses in Income Statement = Total Accrued Expenses\n\n#### 7. **Cash Flow from Operations**\n- **Cash Flow from Operations**: Cash generated from the core business operations.\n  - **Equation**: Cash Flow from Operations = Net Income + Non-Cash Expenses - Increase in Working Capital\n\n### Mermaid Knowledge Graph\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[Financial Statements] --> B[Balance Sheet]\n    A --> C[Income Statement]\n    A --> D[Cash Flow Statement]\n    B --> E[Assets]\n    B --> F[Liabilities]\n    B --> G[Equity]\n    C --> H[Revenues]\n    C --> I[Expenses]\n    D --> J[Operating Activities]\n    D --> K[Investing Activities]\n    D --> L[Financing Activities]\n    E --> M[Cash]\n    E --> N[Inventory]\n    E --> O[Land and Buildings]\n    F --> P[Loans]\n    F --> Q[Accounts Payable]\n    G --> R[Capital]\n    H --> S[Sales]\n    H --> T[Dividends/Interest Received]\n    I --> U[Cost of Goods Sold]\n    I --> V[Salaries]\n    I --> W[Rent]\n    J --> X[Cash Sales]\n    J --> Y[Payment to Vendors]\n    K --> Z[Purchase of Land]\n    K --> AA[Sale of Equipment]\n    L --> AB[Loan Proceeds]\n    L --> AC[Payment of Debt]\n```\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[Partnership Accounting] --> B[Partnership Formation]\n    A --> C[Partnership Transactions]\n    B --> D[Initial Contributions]\n    C --> E[Purchases]\n    C --> F[Sales]\n    C --> G[Withdrawals]\n    C --> H[Loans]\n    E --> I[Inventory]\n    F --> J[Revenues]\n    G --> K[Cash Balance]\n    H --> L[Loan Proceeds]\n```\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[Inventory and COGS] --> B[Inventory]\n    A --> C[Cost of Goods Sold]\n    B --> D[Beginning Inventory]\n    B --> E[Purchases]\n    B --> F[Ending Inventory]\n    C --> G[COGS Equation]\n    G --> H[Beginning Inventory + Purchases -
