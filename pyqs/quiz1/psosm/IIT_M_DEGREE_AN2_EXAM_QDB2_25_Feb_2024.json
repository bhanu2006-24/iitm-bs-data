        "summary": "### Summary of Core Topics, Concepts, Principles, and Equations\n\n#### Core Topics and Concepts\n\n1. **Data Trustworthiness**\n   - Definition: The degree to which data can be trusted.\n   - Importance: Ensures the reliability and accuracy of data used in analysis and decision-making.\n\n2. **Facebook Social Graph**\n   - Primary Access Method: APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) are used to read and write data on the Facebook social graph.\n\n3. **Centrality Measures**\n   - Betweenness Centrality: Measures how often a node occurs on all shortest paths between two nodes. It is crucial for understanding the importance of nodes in a network.\n\n4. **IFCN**\n   - Full Form: International Fact-Checking Network.\n   - Role: Promotes fact-checking and accuracy in information dissemination.\n\n5. **Data Collection Methods**\n   - Unreliable Methods: Web scraping can be unreliable because changes on the website lead to changes in the source code.\n\n6. **Pushshift API**\n   - Role: An unofficial API for Reddit, often used for data collection and analysis.\n\n7. **Web Crawling Frameworks**\n   - Tools: BeautifulSoup and Selenium are commonly used for web crawling.\n   - Note: Django and Flask are web development frameworks, not primarily used for web crawling.\n\n8. **Personally Identifiable Information (PII)**\n   - Definition: Information that can be used to identify an individual.\n   - Example: City can be considered PII in certain contexts.\n\n9. **Unique Identifiers**\n   - Tweets: Typically have numeric unique identifiers.\n   - Reddit Posts: Typically have alphanumeric unique identifiers.\n\n10. **Echo Chamber in Social Media**\n    - Definition: A situation where individuals are exposed only to information that reinforces their existing beliefs.\n    - Avoidance Strategies: Interacting with people of different perspectives and checking multiple sources of information.\n\n#### Principles\n\n1. **Data Reliability**\n   - Ensuring data is accurate and trustworthy is fundamental in data science and analysis.\n\n2. **API Usage**\n   - Understanding how to use APIs to access and manipulate data from social media platforms.\n\n3. **Network Analysis**\n   - Using centrality measures to analyze the importance of nodes in a network.\n\n4. **Fact-Checking**\n   - Promoting accuracy and reliability in information through organizations like IFCN.\n\n5. **Ethical Data Collection**\n   - Using reliable methods for data collection and understanding the ethical implications.\n\n6. **Privacy and Security**\n   - Understanding what constitutes PII and how to protect it.\n\n7. **Avoiding Echo Chambers**\n   - Promoting diverse perspectives and multiple sources of information to avoid bias.\n\n#### Equations\n\nThere are no specific equations mentioned in the provided questions. However, understanding network analysis might involve equations related to centrality measures, such as:\n\n- **Betweenness Centrality**: \\( C_B(v) = \\sum_{s \\neq v \\neq t} \\frac{\\sigma_{st}(v)}{\\sigma_{st}} \\)\n  - Where \\( \\sigma_{st} \\) is the total number of shortest paths from node \\( s \\) to node \\( t \\).\n  - \\( \\sigma_{st}(v) \\) is the number of those paths that pass through node \\( v \\).\n\n### Knowledge Graph \n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[Data Trustworthiness] --> B[Reliability]\n    A --> C[Accuracy]\n    D[Facebook Social Graph] --> E[APIs]\n    F[Centrality Measures] --> G[Betweenness Centrality]\n    H[IFCN] --> I[Fact-Checking]\n    J[Data Collection Methods] --> K[Web Scraping]\n    L[Pushshift API] --> M[Reddit Data]\n    N[Web Crawling Frameworks] --> O[BeautifulSoup]\n    N --> P[Selenium]\n    Q[Personally Identifiable Information] --> R[City]\n    S[Unique Identifiers] --> T[Tweets]\n    S --> U[Reddit Posts]\n    V[Echo Chamber] --> W[Diverse Perspectives]\n    V --> X[Multiple Sources]\n```\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    B[Reliability] --> C[Data Trustworthiness]\n    E[APIs] --> D[Facebook Social Graph]\n    G[Betweenness Centrality] --> F[Centrality Measures]\n    I[Fact-Checking] --> H[IFCN]\n    K[Web Scraping] --> J[Data Collection Methods]\n    M[Reddit Data] --> L[Pushshift API]\n    O[BeautifulSoup] --> N[Web Crawling Frameworks]\n    P[Selenium] --> N\n    R[City] --> Q[Personally Identifiable Information]\n    T[Tweets] --> S[Unique Identifiers]\n    U[Reddit Posts] --> S\n    W[Diverse Perspectives] --> V[Echo Chamber]\n    X[Multiple Sources] --> V\n```\n\nThese graphs visually map the relationships between the core topics, providing a clear and easy-to-understand overview of the key concepts and principles essential for the exam.",
