**Boolean Logic**: Using logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`) to combine conditions.\n   - **Flag Variables**: Using flags to mark specific conditions.\n\n#### Important Equations and Logic\n\n1. **Summation and Counting**\n   ```plaintext\n   sum = sum + value\n   count = count + 1\n   ```\n\n2. **Averaging**\n   ```plaintext\n   average = sum / count\n   ```\n\n3. **Conditional Logic**\n   ```plaintext\n   if (condition1 and condition2) {\n       // Action\n   }\n   if (condition1 or condition2) {\n       // Action\n   }\n   ```\n\n4. **Loop Structures**\n   ```plaintext\n   while (condition) {\n       // Process data\n   }\n   ```\n\n5. **Data Movement**\n   ```plaintext\n   Move X to Table 2\n   ```\n\n6. **Special Conditions**\n   - **Special Words**: Words are different, have different letter counts, and the same number of vowels.\n   - **Special Pairs**: Pairs of students who are of the same gender or from the same city but not both.\n\n#### Key Pseudocode Snippets\n\n1. **Counting Special Words**\n   ```plaintext\n   if (X.Word != Y.Word) {\n       if (X.LetterCount != Y.LetterCount) {\n           if (vCount(X) == vCount(Y)) {\n               count = count + 1\n           }\n       }\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. **Finding Pairs**\n   ```plaintext\n   if ((X.Gender == Y.Gender or X.TownCity == Y.TownCity) and not (X.Gender == Y.Gender and X.TownCity == Y.TownCity)) {\n       count = count + 1\n   }\n   ```\n\n3. **Calculating Averages**\n   ```plaintext\n   SumT = SumT + X.LetterCount\n   CountT = CountT + 1\n   B = SumT / CountT\n   ```\n\n### Knowledge Graph \n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[Data Structures and Algorithms] --> B[Pseudocode Execution];\n    A --> C[Loop Structures];\n    A --> D[Conditional Statements];\n    A --> E[Data Manipulation];\n\n    F[Data Analysis] --> G[Dataset Processing];\n    F --> H[Filtering Data];\n    F --> I[Aggregation];\n\n    J[Mathematical Operations] --> K[Summation];\n    J --> L[Averaging];\n    J --> M[Counting];\n\n    N[Logical Operations] --> O[Boolean Logic];\n    N --> P[Flag Variables];\n\n    B --> Q[Understanding Pseudocode];\n    C --> R[While Loops];\n    D --> S[If Statements];\n    E --> T[Moving Data];\n\n    G --> U[Reading Rows];\n    H --> V[Applying Conditions];\n    I --> W[Summing, Counting, Averaging];\n\n    K --> X[sum = sum + value];\n    L --> Y[average = sum / count];\n    M --> Z[count = count + 1];\n\n    O --> AA[Logical Operators];\n    P --> AB[Using Flags];\n\n    Q --> AC[Analyzing Pseudocode];\n    R --> AD[Iterating Through Data];\n    S --> AE[Filtering Data];\n    T --> AF[Manipulating Data];\n\n    U --> AG[Processing Datasets];\n    V --> AH[Filtering Based on Conditions];\n    W --> AI[Aggregating Data];\n\n    X --> AJ[Summation Equation];\n    Y --> AK[Averaging Equation];\n    Z --> AL[Counting Equation];\n\n    AA --> AM[Combining Conditions];\n    AB --> AN[Marking Conditions];\n\n    AC --> AO[Determining Final Values];\n    AD --> AP[Loop Structures];\n    AE --> AQ[Conditional Logic];\n    AF --> AR[Data Movement];\n\n    AG --> AS[Reading Rows];\n    AH --> AT[Filtering Data];\n    AI --> AU[Aggregating Data];\n\n    AJ --> AV[sum = sum + value];\n    AK --> AW[average = sum / count];\n    AL --> AX[count = count + 1];\n\n    AM --> AY[Logical Operators];\n    AN --> AZ[Flag Variables];\n\n    AO --> BA[Final Values];\n    AP --> BB[While Loops];\n    AQ --> BC[If Statements];\n    AR --> BD[Moving Data];\n\n    AS --> BE[Processing Datasets];\n    AT --> BF[Filtering Based on Conditions];\n    AU --> BG[Aggregating Data];\n\n    AV --> BH[Summation];\n    AW --> BI[Averaging];\n    AX --> BJ[Counting];\n\n    AY --> BK[Combining Conditions];\n    AZ --> BL[Marking Conditions];\n\n    BA --> BM[Final Values];\n    BB --> BN[While Loops];\n    BC --> BO[If Statements];\n    BD --> BP[Moving Data];\n\n    BE --> BQ[Processing Datasets];\n    BF --> BR[Filtering Based on Conditions];\n    BG --> BS[Aggregating Data];\n\n    BH --> BT[Summation];\n    BI --> BU[Averaging];\n    BJ --> BV[Counting];\n\n    BK --> BW[Combining Conditions];\n    BL --> BX[Marking Conditions];\n```\n\nThis knowledge graph visually maps the relationships between the core topics, concepts, principles, and equations essential for the exam.",
