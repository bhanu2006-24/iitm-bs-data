It was in 1917.\u201d   He had gone to the December 1916 annual convention of the Indian National Congress party in Lucknow. There were 2,301 delegates and many visitors. \"During the proceedings,\" Gandhi recounted, \u201ca peasant came up to me looking like any other peasant in India, poor and emaciated, and said, \u2018I am Rajkumar Shukla. I am from Champaran, and I want you to come to my district\u2019!\u2019\u2019 Gandhi had never heard of the place. It was in the foothills of the towering Himalayas, near the kingdom of Nepal.  Under an ancient arrangement, the Champaran peasants were sharecroppers. Rajkumar Shukla was one of them. He was illiterate but resolute. He had come to the Congress session to complain about the injustice of the landlord system in Bihar, and somebody had probably said, \u201cSpeak to Gandhi.\u201d  Gandhi told Shukla he had an appointment in Cawnpore and was also committed to go to other parts of India. Shukla accompanied him everywhere. Then Gandhi returned to his ashram near Ahmedabad. Shukla followed him to the ashram. For weeks he never left Gandhi\u2019s side.   \u201cFix a date,\u201d he begged.  Impressed by the sharecropper\u2019s tenacity and story Gandhi said, \u2018\u2018I have to be in Calcutta on such-and-such a date. Come and meet me and take me from there.\u201d Months passed. Shukla was sitting on his haunches at the appointed spot in Calcutta when Gandhi arrived; he waited till Gandhi was free. Then the two of them boarded a train for the city of Patna in Bihar. There Shukla led him to the house of a lawyer named Rajendra Prasad who later became President of the Congress party and of India. Rajendra Prasad was out of town, but the servants knew Shukla as a poor yeoman who pestered their master to help the indigo sharecroppers. So they let him stay on the grounds with his companion, Gandhi, whom they took to be another peasant. But Gandhi was not permitted to draw water from the well lest some drops from his bucket pollute the entire source; how did they know that he was not an untouchable?  Gandhi decided to go first to Muzzafarpur, which was en route to Champaran, to obtain more complete information about conditions than Shukla was capable of imparting. He accordingly sent a telegram to Professor J.B. Kripalani, of the Arts College in Muzzafarpur, whom he had seen at Tagore\u2019s Shantiniketan school. The train arrived at midnight, 15 April 1917. Kripalani was waiting at the station with a large body of students. Gandhi stayed there for two days in the home of Professor Malkani, a teacher in a government school.  - Indigo - Louis Fischer",

It was in 1917.\u201d   He had gone to the December 1916 annual convention of the Indian National Congress party in Lucknow. There were 2,301 delegates and many visitors. \"During the proceedings,\" Gandhi recounted, \u201ca peasant came up to me looking like any other peasant in India, poor and emaciated, and said, \u2018I am Rajkumar Shukla. I am from Champaran, and I want you to come to my district\u2019!\u2019\u2019 Gandhi had never heard of the place. It was in the foothills of the towering Himalayas, near the kingdom of Nepal.  Under an ancient arrangement, the Champaran peasants were sharecroppers. Rajkumar Shukla was one of them. He was illiterate but resolute. He had come to the Congress session to complain about the injustice of the landlord system in Bihar, and somebody had probably said, \u201cSpeak to Gandhi.\u201d  Gandhi told Shukla he had an appointment in Cawnpore and was also committed to go to other parts of India. Shukla accompanied him everywhere. Then Gandhi returned to his ashram near Ahmedabad. Shukla followed him to the ashram. For weeks he never left Gandhi\u2019s side.   \u201cFix a date,\u201d he begged.  Impressed by the sharecropper\u2019s tenacity and story Gandhi said, \u2018\u2018I have to be in Calcutta on such-and-such a date. Come and meet me and take me from there.\u201d Months passed. Shukla was sitting on his haunches at the appointed spot in Calcutta when Gandhi arrived; he waited till Gandhi was free. Then the two of them boarded a train for the city of Patna in Bihar. There Shukla led him to the house of a lawyer named Rajendra Prasad who later became President of the Congress party and of India. Rajendra Prasad was out of town, but the servants knew Shukla as a poor yeoman who pestered their master to help the indigo sharecroppers. So they let him stay on the grounds with his companion, Gandhi, whom they took to be another peasant. But Gandhi was not permitted to draw water from the well lest some drops from his bucket pollute the entire source; how did they know that he was not an untouchable?  Gandhi decided to go first to Muzzafarpur, which was en route to Champaran, to obtain more complete information about conditions than Shukla was capable of imparting. He accordingly sent a telegram to Professor J.B. Kripalani, of the Arts College in Muzzafarpur, whom he had seen at Tagore\u2019s Shantiniketan school. The train arrived at midnight, 15 April 1917. Kripalani was waiting at the station with a large body of students. Gandhi stayed there for two days in the home of Professor Malkani, a teacher in a government school.  - Indigo - Louis Fischer",

It was in 1917.\u201d   He had gone to the December 1916 annual convention of the Indian National Congress party in Lucknow. There were 2,301 delegates and many visitors. \"During the proceedings,\" Gandhi recounted, \u201ca peasant came up to me looking like any other peasant in India, poor and emaciated, and said, \u2018I am Rajkumar Shukla. I am from Champaran, and I want you to come to my district\u2019!\u2019\u2019 Gandhi had never heard of the place. It was in the foothills of the towering Himalayas, near the kingdom of Nepal.  Under an ancient arrangement, the Champaran peasants were sharecroppers. Rajkumar Shukla was one of them. He was illiterate but resolute. He had come to the Congress session to complain about the injustice of the landlord system in Bihar, and somebody had probably said, \u201cSpeak to Gandhi.\u201d  Gandhi told Shukla he had an appointment in Cawnpore and was also committed to go to other parts of India. Shukla accompanied him everywhere. Then Gandhi returned to his ashram near Ahmedabad. Shukla followed him to the ashram. For weeks he never left Gandhi\u2019s side.   \u201cFix a date,\u201d he begged.  Impressed by the sharecropper\u2019s tenacity and story Gandhi said, \u2018\u2018I have to be in Calcutta on such-and-such a date. Come and meet me and take me from there.\u201d Months passed. Shukla was sitting on his haunches at the appointed spot in Calcutta when Gandhi arrived; he waited till Gandhi was free. Then the two of them boarded a train for the city of Patna in Bihar. There Shukla led him to the house of a lawyer named Rajendra Prasad who later became President of the Congress party and of India. Rajendra Prasad was out of town, but the servants knew Shukla as a poor yeoman who pestered their master to help the indigo sharecroppers. So they let him stay on the grounds with his companion, Gandhi, whom they took to be another peasant. But Gandhi was not permitted to draw water from the well lest some drops from his bucket pollute the entire source; how did they know that he was not an untouchable?  Gandhi decided to go first to Muzzafarpur, which was en route to Champaran, to obtain more complete information about conditions than Shukla was capable of imparting. He accordingly sent a telegram to Professor J.B. Kripalani, of the Arts College in Muzzafarpur, whom he had seen at Tagore\u2019s Shantiniketan school. The train arrived at midnight, 15 April 1917. Kripalani was waiting at the station with a large body of students. Gandhi stayed there for two days in the home of Professor Malkani, a teacher in a government school.  - Indigo - Louis Fischer",

                            "Read the following passage and answer the given subquestions\n When I first visited Gandhi in 1942 at his ashram in Sevagram, in central India, he said, \u201cI will tell you how it happened that I decided to urge the departure of the British. It was in 1917.\u201d   He had gone to the December 1916 annual convention of the Indian National Congress party in Lucknow. There were 2,301 delegates and many visitors. \"During the proceedings,\" Gandhi recounted, \u201ca peasant came up to me looking like any other peasant in India, poor and emaciated, and said, \u2018I am Rajkumar Shukla. I am from Champaran, and I want you to come to my district\u2019!\u2019\u2019 Gandhi had never heard of the place. It was in the foothills of the towering Himalayas, near the kingdom of Nepal.  Under an ancient arrangement, the Champaran peasants were sharecroppers. Rajkumar Shukla was one of them. He was illiterate but resolute. He had come to the Congress session to complain about the injustice of the landlord system in Bihar, and somebody had probably said, \u201cSpeak to Gandhi.\u201d  Gandhi told Shukla he had an appointment in Cawnpore and was also committed to go to other parts of India. Shukla accompanied him everywhere. Then Gandhi returned to his ashram near Ahmedabad. Shukla followed him to the ashram. For weeks he never left Gandhi\u2019s side.   \u201cFix a date,\u201d he begged.  Impressed by the sharecropper\u2019s tenacity and story Gandhi said, \u2018\u2018I have to be in Calcutta on such-and-such a date. Come and meet me and take me from there.\u201d Months passed. Shukla was sitting on his haunches at the appointed spot in Calcutta when Gandhi arrived; he waited till Gandhi was free. Then the two of them boarded a train for the city of Patna in Bihar. There Shukla led him to the house of a lawyer named Rajendra Prasad who later became President of the Congress party and of India. Rajendra Prasad was out of town, but the servants knew Shukla as a poor yeoman who pestered their master to help the indigo sharecroppers. So they let him stay on the grounds with his companion, Gandhi, whom they took to be another peasant. But Gandhi was not permitted to draw water from the well lest some drops from his bucket pollute the entire source; how did they know that he was not an untouchable?  Gandhi decided to go first to Muzzafarpur, which was en route to Champaran, to obtain more complete information about conditions than Shukla was capable of imparting. He accordingly sent a telegram to Professor J.B. Kripalani, of the Arts College in Muzzafarpur, whom he had seen at Tagore\u2019s Shantiniketan school. The train arrived at midnight, 15 April 1917. Kripalani was waiting at the station with a large body of students. Gandhi stayed there for two days in the home of Professor Malkani, a teacher in a government school.  - Indigo - Louis Fischer"
