        "summary": "### Summary of Core Topics, Concepts, and Principles\n\nThe exam paper covers a variety of topics related to English grammar, syntax, and semantics. Here are the core topics, concepts, and principles essential for the exam:\n\n#### 1. **Discourse Markers**\n- **Definition**: Words or phrases that connect ideas and show the relationship between them.\n- **Examples**: As a matter of fact, furthermore, truly, however, unless.\n- **Usage**: Used to fill in blanks to connect sentences logically.\n\n#### 2. **Emphasis and Meaning**\n- **Definition**: The stress placed on certain words in a sentence to convey different meanings.\n- **Examples**: Emphasis on \"you,\" \"Alex and John,\" \"moving,\" \"to,\" \"Bombay.\"\n- **Usage**: Understanding how emphasis changes the meaning of a sentence.\n\n#### 3. **Figures of Speech**\n- **Irony**: Using words to convey a meaning that is the opposite of its literal meaning.\n- **Paradox**: A statement that seems contradictory but may be true.\n- **Oxymoron**: A figure of speech that juxtaposes elements that appear to be contradictory.\n- **Pun**: A form of wordplay that suggests two or more meanings.\n- **Consonance**: Repetition of consonant sounds.\n- **Assonance**: Repetition of vowel sounds.\n\n#### 4. **Adverbs**\n- **Definition**: Words that modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs.\n- **Examples**: Often, very, fastly, too, very much.\n- **Usage**: Identifying adverbs in sentences and understanding their roles.\n\n#### 5. **Tenses**\n- **Future Perfect Tense**: Describes an action that will be completed by a certain future time.\n- **Examples**: \"By next week, I will have finished this painting.\"\n\n#### 6. **Logical/Semantic Roles**\n- **Agent**: The doer of an action.\n- **Experiencer**: The one who experiences the action.\n- **Instrument**: The tool used to perform the action.\n- **Theme**: The entity undergoing the action.\n\n#### 7. **Passive Voice**\n- **Definition**: A sentence structure where the subject receives the action.\n- **Examples**: \"The medal is taken by Sajal.\"\n\n#### 8. **Adjectives**\n- **Definition**: Words that describe or modify nouns.\n- **Examples**: Dedicated, shallow, bad.\n- **Usage**: Identifying adjectives and their roles in sentences.\n\n#### 9. **Degree Adverbs**\n- **Definition**: Adverbs that indicate the degree of something.\n- **Examples**: Very, very much.\n- **Usage**: Understanding the use of degree adverbs in sentences.\n\n#### 10. **Comment Adverbs**\n- **Definition**: Adverbs that express the speaker's attitude or comment on the situation.\n- **Usage**: Can occur at the front, middle, or end of a sentence.\n\n#### 11. **Embedded Clauses**\n- **Definition**: Clauses that function as a single part of speech within a main clause.\n- **Examples**: \"She knows where to find it.\"\n- **Usage**: Identifying the role of embedded clauses in sentences.\n\n#### 12. **Relative Clauses**\n- **Definition**: Clauses that provide additional information about a noun.\n- **Examples**: \"The dog which has been chasing us has now disappeared.\"\n- **Usage**: Identifying relative pronouns and their functions.\n\n#### 13. **Compound Sentences**\n- **Definition**: Sentences that contain two or more independent clauses.\n- **Examples**: \"Rohan resigned and joined a new company.\"\n- **Usage**: Using coordinating conjunctions to form compound sentences.\n\n#### 14. **Adjuncts and Complements**\n- **Definition**: Adjuncts are optional elements that add information to a sentence, while complements are necessary to complete the meaning.\n- **Examples**: \"I\u2019ll come after I have had my breakfast.\" (Adjunct), \"I find him intelligent.\" (Complement).\n- **Usage**: Identifying adjuncts and complements in sentences.\n\n### Knowledge Graph \n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[English Grammar] --> B[Discourse Markers];\n    A
