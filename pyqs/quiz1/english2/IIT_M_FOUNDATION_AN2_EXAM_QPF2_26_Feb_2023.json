Here are the core topics, concepts, and principles that are essential to study for the exam:\n\n#### 1. **Discourse Markers**\n- **Concept**: Words or phrases that connect ideas and show the relationship between them.\n- **Examples**: As a matter of fact, furthermore, truly, however, unless.\n\n#### 2. **Emphasis and Meaning**\n- **Concept**: Understanding how emphasis on different words in a sentence can change its meaning.\n- **Examples**: Emphasis on \"you,\" \"Alex and John,\" \"moving,\" \"to,\" and \"Bombay.\"\n\n#### 3. **Figures of Speech**\n- **Concept**: Literary devices used to create special effects or meanings.\n- **Examples**: Irony, paradox, oxymoron, pun, consonance, assonance.\n\n#### 4. **Adverbs**\n- **Concept**: Words that modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs.\n- **Examples**: Often, very, fastly, too, very much.\n\n#### 5. **Verb Tenses**\n- **Concept**: Understanding different verb tenses and their usage.\n- **Examples**: Simple present, future perfect, past perfect.\n\n#### 6. **Logical/Semantic Roles**\n- **Concept**: Identifying the role of words in a sentence.\n- **Examples**: Agent, experiencer, instrument, theme.\n\n#### 7. **Passive Voice**\n- **Concept**: Converting sentences from active to passive voice.\n- **Examples**: \"Sajal takes the medal\" becomes \"The medal is taken by Sajal.\"\n\n#### 8. **Adjectives**\n- **Concept**: Words that describe or modify nouns.\n- **Examples**: Attributive, predicative, degree adjectives.\n\n#### 9. **Degree Adverbs**\n- **Concept**: Adverbs used to indicate the degree of something.\n- **Examples**: Very, very much.\n\n#### 10. **Comment Adverbs**\n- **Concept**: Adverbs that express the speaker's attitude or comment on the situation.\n- **Examples**: Position in a sentence (front, middle, end).\n\n#### 11. **Embedded Clauses**\n- **Concept**: Clauses within a sentence that function as a single part of speech.\n- **Examples**: Object clauses, relative clauses, adjectival clauses.\n\n#### 12. **Sentence Structure**\n- **Concept**: Understanding different types of sentences and their structures.\n- **Examples**: Simple sentences, compound sentences, complex sentences.\n\n#### 13. **Adjuncts and Complements**\n- **Concept**: Understanding the role of adjuncts and complements in sentences.\n- **Examples**: Adjuncts provide additional information, complements complete the meaning.\n\n### Knowledge Graph \n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[English Grammar] --> B[Discourse Markers];\n    A --> C[Emphasis and Meaning];\n    A --> D[Figures of Speech];\n    A --> E[Adverbs];\n    A --> F[Verb Tenses];\n    A --> G[Logical/Semantic Roles];\n    A --> H[Passive Voice];\n    A --> I[Adjectives];\n    A --> J[Degree Adverbs];\n    A --> K[Comment Adverbs];\n    A --> L[Embedded Clauses];\n    A --> M[Sentence Structure];\n    A --> N[Adjuncts and Complements];\n\n    B --> B1[As a matter of fact];\n    B --> B2[Furthermore];\n    B --> B3[Truly];\n    B --> B4[However];\n    B --> B5[Unless];\n\n    C --> C1[Emphasis on you];\n    C --> C2[Emphasis on Alex and John];\n    C --> C3[Emphasis on moving];\n    C --> C4[Emphasis on to];\n    C --> C5[Emphasis on Bombay];\n\n    D --> D1[Irony];\n    D --> D2[Paradox];\n    D --> D3[Oxymoron];\n    D --> D4[Pun];\n    D --> D5[Consonance];\n    D --> D6[Assonance];\n\n    E --> E1[Often];\n    E --> E2[Very];\n    E --> E3[Fastly];\n    E --> E4[Too];\n    E --> E5[Very much];\n\n    F --> F1[Simple Present];\n    F --> F2[Future Perfect];\n    F --> F3[Past Perfect];\n\n    G --> G1[Agent];\n    G --> G2[Experiencer];\n    G --> G3[Instrument];\n    G --> G4[Theme];\n\n    H --> H1[Active to Passive];\n\n    I --> I1[Attributive];\n    I --> I2[Predicative];\n    I --> I3[Degree Adjectives];\n\n    J --> J1[Very];\n    J --> J2[Very much];\n\n    K --> K1[Front];\n    K --> K2[Middle];\n    K --> K3[End];\n\n    L --> L1[Object Clauses];\n    L --> L2[Relative Clauses];\n    L --> L3[Adjectival Clauses];\n\n    M --> M1[Simple Sentences];\n    M --> M2[Compound Sentences];\n    M --> M3[Complex Sentences];\n\n    N --> N1[Adjuncts];\n    N --> N2[Complements];\n```\n\nThis knowledge graph visually maps the relationships between the core topics in English grammar, syntax, and semantics that are essential for the exam.",
