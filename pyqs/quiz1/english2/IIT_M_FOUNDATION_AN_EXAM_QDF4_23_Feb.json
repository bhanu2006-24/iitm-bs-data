Read the essay and answer the given subquestions that follow. \nPeace Is Getting More Costly Everywhere \nIn the current global climate, the expense associated with maintaining peace is increasing at a rapid pace. Peace has become a valuable commodity in various regions across the globe, ranging from the simmering borders of Eastern Europe to the volatile pockets of the Middle East, and from the tumultuous corners of Sub-Saharan Africa to the rising tensions in the South China Sea. The escalation of global conflicts is not necessarily a recent occurrence. Throughout history, humanity has experienced prolonged periods of conflicts and strife. The evolving nature of these conflicts is characterized by an increasing level of intricacy and breadth. The nature of contemporary conflicts has become more transnational, characterized by the rise of non-state entities, cyber warfare, and the expansion of asymmetric warfare. These factors (1)_____ the expenses associated with peace-building. \nThe protracted conflict in Syria is an example. After 12 years, the situation in Syria serves as a poignant example of the high cost of achieving peace. The initial civil unrest against the regime of Bashar-al-Assad has evolved into a complex crisis that involves multiple international stakeholders. The significant impact on both human life and infrastructure is profound; however, it represents only a single aspect of the actual expense. The subsequent refugee crisis has placed a significant burden on the resources of neighboring nations and has caused political instability that extends well beyond the borders of Syria. The international community has allocated significant financial resources towards humanitarian aid, refugee resettlement, and military interventions, with no clear resolution in sight. \nThe dispute in the South China Sea presents a distinct, but equally concerning example of the increasing cost of maintaining peace. Several nations (2.a.) _____ their ownership over this crucial maritime area, resulting in a progressively growing military presence in the (2.b.) _____. In addition to the substantial defense expenditures, there exists an intangible expense associated with the (3) _____ tension. The possibility of a significant conflict in one of the most heavily trafficked sea lanes worldwide presents a potential disturbance to international trade routes, which could result in far-reaching economic implications. \nThe ongoing conflict in the Sahel region of Africa presents a clear depiction of the increasing expenses associated with maintaining peace. The (4.a.) _____ of violent extremism, intercommunal conflicts, and food insecurity has resulted in a significant (4.b.) _____ in displacement, with millions compelled to abandon their residences. The financial expense required to reestablish harmony and reconstruct these communities is significant. The allocation of resources towards the international community\u2019s response, which includes peacekeeping missions, humanitarian aid, and development assistance, is perceived as a burden on the global economy. Contemporary disputes frequently entail multiple stakeholders, each with distinct objectives, thereby rendering diplomatic resolution more intricate and expensive. Furthermore, the widespread incorporation of technology in military operations, ranging from cyber warfare to unmanned aerial vehicles, has escalated the economic costs linked with peacekeeping efforts.

Read the essay and answer the given subquestions that follow. \nPeace Is Getting More Costly Everywhere \nIn the current global climate, the expense associated with maintaining peace is increasing at a rapid pace. Peace has become a valuable commodity in various regions across the globe, ranging from the simmering borders of Eastern Europe to the volatile pockets of the Middle East, and from the tumultuous corners of Sub-Saharan Africa to the rising tensions in the South China Sea. The escalation of global conflicts is not necessarily a recent occurrence. Throughout history, humanity has experienced prolonged periods of conflicts and strife. The evolving nature of these conflicts is characterized by an increasing level of intricacy and breadth. The nature of contemporary conflicts has become more transnational, characterized by the rise of non-state entities, cyber warfare, and the expansion of asymmetric warfare. These factors (1)_____ the expenses associated with peace-building. \nThe protracted conflict in Syria is an example. After 12 years, the situation in Syria serves as a poignant example of the high cost of achieving peace. The initial civil unrest against the regime of Bashar-al-Assad has evolved into a complex crisis that involves multiple international stakeholders. The significant impact on both human life and infrastructure is profound; however, it represents only a single aspect of the actual expense. The subsequent refugee crisis has placed a significant burden on the resources of neighboring nations and has caused political instability that extends well beyond the borders of Syria. The international community has allocated significant financial resources towards humanitarian aid, refugee resettlement, and military interventions, with no clear resolution in sight. \nThe dispute in the South China Sea presents a distinct, but equally concerning example of the increasing cost of maintaining peace. Several nations (2.a.) _____ their ownership over this crucial maritime area, resulting in a progressively growing military presence in the (2.b.) _____. In addition to the substantial defense expenditures, there exists an intangible expense associated with the (3) _____ tension. The possibility of a significant conflict in one of the most heavily trafficked sea lanes worldwide presents a potential disturbance to international trade routes, which could result in far-reaching economic implications. \nThe ongoing conflict in the Sahel region of Africa presents a clear depiction of the increasing expenses associated with maintaining peace. The (4.a.) _____ of violent extremism, intercommunal conflicts, and food insecurity has resulted in a significant (4.b.) _____ in displacement, with millions compelled to abandon their residences. The financial expense required to reestablish harmony and reconstruct these communities is significant. The allocation of resources towards the international community\u2019s response, which includes peacekeeping missions, humanitarian aid, and development assistance, is perceived as a burden on the global economy. Contemporary disputes frequently entail multiple stakeholders, each with distinct objectives, thereby rendering diplomatic resolution more intricate and expensive. Furthermore, the widespread incorporation of technology in military operations, ranging from cyber warfare to unmanned aerial vehicles, has escalated the economic costs linked with peacekeeping efforts.

Peace has become a valuable commodity in various regions across the globe, ranging from the simmering borders of Eastern Europe to the volatile pockets of the Middle East, and from the tumultuous corners of Sub-Saharan Africa to the rising tensions in the South China Sea. The escalation of global conflicts is not necessarily a recent occurrence. Throughout history, humanity has experienced prolonged periods of conflicts and strife. The evolving nature of these conflicts is characterized by an increasing level of intricacy and breadth. The nature of contemporary conflicts has become more transnational, characterized by the rise of non-state entities, cyber warfare, and the expansion of asymmetric warfare. These factors (1)_____ the expenses associated with peace-building. \nThe protracted conflict in Syria is an example. After 12 years, the situation in Syria serves as a poignant example of the high cost of achieving peace. The initial civil unrest against the regime of Bashar-al-Assad has evolved into a complex crisis that involves multiple international stakeholders. The significant impact on both human life and infrastructure is profound; however, it represents only a single aspect of the actual expense. The subsequent refugee crisis has placed a significant burden on the resources of neighboring nations and has caused political instability that extends well beyond the borders of Syria.
