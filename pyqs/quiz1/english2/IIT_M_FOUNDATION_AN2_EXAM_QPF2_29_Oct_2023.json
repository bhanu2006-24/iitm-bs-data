        "summary": "### Summary of Core Topics, Concepts, Principles, and Equations\n\nThe exam focuses on various aspects of English grammar, syntax, and semantics. Below is a summary of the core topics and concepts:\n\n#### 1. **Parts of Speech**\n   - **Adverbs**: Words that modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs.\n     - Example: \"impatiently\" in \"Ravi waited impatiently for the results.\"\n   - **Adjectives**: Words that describe nouns.\n     - Example: \"brilliant\" in \"Ameya was brilliant in today's class test.\"\n   - **Verbs**: Words that express action or state of being.\n     - Example: \"oiled\" in \"The worker oiled the machines.\"\n\n#### 2. **Sentence Structure**\n   - **Simple Sentences**: Contain a single independent clause.\n     - Example: \"Mary\u2019s story is very long.\"\n   - **Compound Sentences**: Contain two or more independent clauses joined by coordinating conjunctions.\n     - Example: \"Mary\u2019s story is very long, but it is thrilling.\"\n   - **Complex Sentences**: Contain an independent clause and one or more dependent clauses.\n     - Example: \"He is sure that Hari will walk in any time soon.\"\n\n#### 3. **Clauses**\n   - **Independent Clauses**: Can stand alone as a sentence.\n     - Example: \"Reena wrote a letter.\"\n   - **Dependent Clauses**: Cannot stand alone and need an independent clause to complete the sentence.\n     - Example: \"which was postponed earlier\" in \"The competition, which was postponed earlier, was held successfully.\"\n\n#### 4. **Types of Clauses**\n   - **Adjectival Clauses**: Modify nouns.\n     - Example: \"whose names are on the roster\" in \"Those people whose names are on the roster will have to report early.\"\n   - **Adverbial Clauses**: Modify verbs, adjectives, or adverbs.\n     - Example: \"Even though I arrived very early\" in \"Even though I arrived very early, the train was late.\"\n   - **Complement Clauses**: Complete the meaning of the sentence.\n     - Example: \"that Hari will walk in any time soon\" in \"He is sure that Hari will walk in any time soon.\"\n\n#### 5. **Voice**\n   - **Active Voice**: The subject performs the action.\n     - Example: \"The government will issue the contract.\"\n   - **Passive Voice**: The subject receives the action.\n     - Example: \"The contract will be issued by the government.\"\n\n#### 6. **Figures of Speech**\n   - **Antithesis**: Contrast of ideas within a parallel grammatical structure.\n     - Example: \"Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee.\"\n   - **Assonance**: Repetition of vowel sounds.\n     - Example: \"Dunkin\u2019 Donuts, Best Buy, and Blackberry\" (not an example of assonance).\n\n#### 7. **Conjunctions**\n   - **Coordinating Conjunctions**: Join words, phrases, or clauses of equal rank.\n     - Example: \"but\" in \"Mary\u2019s story is very long, but it is thrilling.\"\n\n#### 8. **Relative Pronouns**\n   - **Relative Pronouns**: Introduce relative clauses.\n     - Example: \"who\" in \"Bergman, who made several acclaimed films, was felicitated in the event.\"\n\n#### 9. **Adverbial Phrases**\n   - **Adverbial Phrases**: Modify verbs, adjectives, or adverbs.\n     - Example: \"to mesmerise the world\" in \"Siva performs his dance to mesmerise the world.\"\n\n#### 10. **Emphasis and Meaning**\n   - **Emphasis**: Changing the emphasis in a sentence can alter its meaning.\n     - Example: Emphasizing \"you\" in \"Did you know that Alex and John are moving to Bombay?\" implies that the speaker believes the person they are talking to would not know the information.\n\n### Knowledge Graph \n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[Parts of Speech] --> B[Adverbs];\n    A --> C[Adjectives];\n    A --> D[Verbs];\n    E[Sentence Structure] --> F[Simple Sentences];\n    E --> G[Compound Sentences];\n    E --> H[Complex Sentences];\n    I[Clauses] --> J[Independent Clauses];\n    I --> K[Dependent Clauses];\n    L[Types of Clauses] --> M[Adjectival Clauses];\n    L --> N[Adverbial Clauses];\n    L --> O[Complement Clauses];\n    P[Voice] --> Q[Active Voice];\n    P --> R[Passive Voice];\n    S[Figures of Speech] --> T[Antithesis];\n    S --> U[Assonance];\n    V[Conjunctions] --> W[Coordinating Conjunctions];\n    X[Relative Pronouns] --> Y[Relative Pronouns];\n    Z[Adverbial Phrases] --> AA[Adverbial Phrases];\n    AB[Emphasis and Meaning] --> AC[Emphasis];\n```\n\nThis knowledge graph visually maps the relationships between the core topics covered in the exam.",
