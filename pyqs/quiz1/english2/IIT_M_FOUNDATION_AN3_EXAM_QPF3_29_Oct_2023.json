Here is a summary of the key areas:\n\n### Core Topics and Concepts\n\n1. **Grammar and Sentence Structure**\n   - **Parts of Speech**: Understanding nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, pronouns, conjunctions, etc.\n   - **Tenses**: Identifying and using different tenses, such as future perfect, future continuous, etc.\n   - **Voice**: Converting sentences between active and passive voice.\n   - **Sentence Types**: Understanding simple, compound, and complex sentences.\n   - **Clauses**: Identifying and using different types of clauses, such as relative clauses, adjectival clauses, adverbial clauses, and complement clauses.\n   - **Phrases**: Understanding the role of phrases in sentences, such as adjuncts and complements.\n\n2. **Vocabulary and Usage**\n   - **Adverbs**: Understanding the use of adverbs, including degree adverbs, viewpoint adverbs, and comment adverbs.\n   - **Adjectives**: Identifying and using attributive and predicative adjectives.\n   - **Conjunctions**: Using coordinating conjunctions to form compound sentences.\n   - **Figures of Speech**: Recognizing and understanding figures of speech like antithesis, assonance, etc.\n\n3. **Comprehension and Interpretation**\n   - **Emphasis and Meaning**: Understanding how emphasis on different words in a sentence can change its meaning.\n   - **Contextual Usage**: Filling in blanks with appropriate words based on the context.\n   - **Logical/Semantic Roles**: Identifying the roles of words or phrases in sentences, such as instruments, recipients, themes, and agents.\n\n### Mermaid Knowledge Graph\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[English Grammar] --> B[Parts of Speech];\n    A --> C[Tenses];\n    A --> D[Voice];\n    A --> E[Sentence Types];\n    B --> F[Nouns];\n    B --> G[Verbs];\n    B --> H[Adjectives];\n    B --> I[Adverbs];\n    B --> J[Pronouns];\n    B --> K[Conjunctions];\n    E --> L[Simple Sentences];\n    E --> M[Compound Sentences];\n    E --> N[Complex Sentences];\n    N --> O[Clauses];\n    O --> P[Relative Clauses];\n    O --> Q[Adjectival Clauses];\n    O --> R[Adverbial Clauses];\n    O --> S[Complement Clauses];\n    E --> T[Phrases];\n    T --> U[Adjuncts];\n    T --> V[Complements];\n    A --> W[Vocabulary and Usage];\n    W --> X[Adverbs];\n    W --> Y[Adjectives];\n    W --> Z[Conjunctions];\n    W --> AA[Figures of Speech];\n    A --> AB[Comprehension and Interpretation];\n    AB --> AC[Emphasis and Meaning];\n    AB --> AD[Contextual Usage];\n    AB --> AE[Logical/Semantic Roles];\n```\n\nThis knowledge graph visually maps the relationships between the core topics in English grammar, vocabulary, and comprehension.
