        "summary": "### Summary of Core Topics, Concepts, Principles, and Equations\n\n#### Grammar and Syntax\n1. **Complements in Sentences**\n   - Understanding the number of complements in a sentence.\n   - Example: \"He assigned me an incomplete task.\" has two complements.\n\n2. **Tenses**\n   - Identifying different tenses in sentences.\n   - Example: \"Richard sits on his couch and broods.\" is in the simple present tense.\n\n3. **Verb Forms**\n   - Understanding the use of verb forms like gerunds (-ing form).\n   - Example: \"The wind was touching the surface of the Thames...\" indicates the continuity of the action in past time.\n\n4. **Adjectival Clauses**\n   - Identifying adjectival clauses and the nouns they modify.\n   - Example: \"The book, which was written by a famous author, became a bestseller.\" The adjectival clause is \"which was written by a famous author,\" and it modifies the noun \"book.\"\n\n5. **Adjectives**\n   - Identifying the nature of adjectives (predicative, attributive).\n   - Example: \"Racewalking is faster than normal walking.\" The adjective \"faster\" is predicative.\n\n6. **Adverbs**\n   - Identifying adverbs and their types (degree adverbs, manner adverbs).\n   - Example: \"Rani is playing soulfully.\" The adverb is \"soulfully.\"\n   - Example: \"She must really be made to tell.\" The degree adverb is \"really.\"\n\n7. **Passive Voice**\n   - Converting sentences to passive voice.\n   - Example: \"Sajal takes the medal.\" becomes \"The medal is taken by Sajal.\"\n\n8. **Sentence Types**\n   - Identifying simple, compound, and complex sentences.\n   - Example: \"Although it was late, she decided to finish her work\" is a complex sentence.\n\n9. **Clauses**\n   - Identifying dependent and independent clauses.\n   - Example: \"The student missed the lecture\" has zero dependent clauses.\n\n10. **Adjuncts and Complements**\n    - Identifying adjuncts and complements in sentences.\n    - Example: \"I kept a copy of the document on my shelf.\" The adjunct is \"on my shelf.\"\n\n#### Discourse Markers\n1. **Discourse Markers in Conversation**\n   - Understanding the use of discourse markers to begin conversations, indicate results, and fill blanks in sentences.\n   - Example: \"So, I wanted to talk to you about something\" uses \"So\" as a discourse marker to begin a conversation.\n\n2. **Positions of Discourse Markers**\n   - Understanding the positions (initial, middle, final) of discourse markers in sentences.\n   - Example: \"Overall\" occurs in the initial position.\n\n#### Literary Devices\n1. **Figures of Speech**\n   - Identifying and understanding figures of speech like assonance, anaphora, sibilance, hyperbole, personification, metaphor, simile, and paradox.\n   - Example: \"A heart of stone\" is a metaphor.\n   - Example: \"Life is much too important to be taken seriously.\" is a paradox.\n\n2. **Intonation and Stress**\n   - Understanding the role of intonation and stress in expressing emotions and meanings.\n   - Example: Intonation helps in expressing emotions and is responsible for pitch variation.\n\n#### Vocabulary and Word Usage\n1. **Adjectives and Adverbs**\n   - Identifying adjectives and adverbs based on word endings and their usage in sentences.\n   - Example: \"Musical\" is most likely to be an adjective based on the word ending.\n\n2. **Relative Pronouns**\n   - Identifying relative pronouns in sentences.\n   - Example: \"The articles that I bought yesterday are already damaged.\" The relative pronoun is \"that.\"\n\n### Mermaid Knowledge Graph\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[Grammar and Syntax] --> B[Complements in Sentences];\n    A --> C[Tenses];\n    A --> D[Verb Forms];\n    A --> E[Adjectival Clauses];\n    A --> F[Adjectives];\n    A --> G[Adverbs];\n    A --> H[Passive Voice];\n    A --> I[Sentence Types];\n    A --> J[Clauses];\n    A --> K[Adjuncts and Complements];\n    L[Discourse Markers] --> M[Discourse Markers in Conversation];\n    L --> N[Positions of Discourse Markers];\n    O[Literary Devices] --> P[Figures of Speech];\n    O --> Q[Intonation and Stress];\n    R[Vocabulary and Word Usage] --> S[Adjectives and Adverbs];\n    R --> T[Relative Pronouns];\n```\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    B[Complements in Sentences] --> B1[Understanding Complements];\n    C[Tenses] --> C1[Simple Present Tense];\n    C --> C2[Simple Past Tense];\n    C --> C3[Present Perfect Tense];\n    D[Verb Forms] --> D1[Gerunds];\n    E[Adjectival Clauses] --> E1[Identifying Clauses];\n    E --> E2[Modifying Nouns];\n    F[Adjectives] --> F1[Predicative Adjectives];\n    F --> F2[Attributive Adjectives];\n    G[Adverbs] --> G1[Degree Adverbs];\n    G --> G2[Manner Adverbs];\n    H[Passive Voice] --> H1[Converting to Passive];\n    I[Sentence Types] --> I1[Simple Sentences];\n    I --> I2[Compound Sentences];\n    I --> I3[Complex Sentences];\n    J[Clauses] --> J1[Dependent Clauses];\n    J --> J2[Independent Clauses];\n    K[Adjuncts and Complements] --> K1[Identifying Adjuncts];\n    K --> K2[Identifying Complements];\n    M[Discourse Markers in Conversation] --> M1[Beginning Conversations];\n    M --> M2[Indicating Results];\n    N[Positions of Discourse Markers] --> N1[Initial Position];\n    N --> N2[Middle Position];\n    N --> N3[Final Position];\n    P[Figures of Speech] --> P1[Assonance];\n    P --> P2[Anaphora];\n    P --> P3[Sibilance];\n    P --> P4[Hyperbole];\n    P --> P5[Personification];\n    P --> P6[Metaphor];\n    P --> P7[Simile];\n    P --> P8[Paradox];\n    Q[Intonation and Stress] --> Q1[Expressing Emotions];\n    Q --> Q2[Pitch Variation];\n    S[Adjectives and Adverbs] --> S1[Identifying Adjectives];\n    S --> S2[Identifying Adverbs];\n    T[Relative Pronouns] --> T1[Identifying Pronouns];\n```\n\nThis summary and knowledge graph should help you focus on the essential topics and concepts for your exam.",
