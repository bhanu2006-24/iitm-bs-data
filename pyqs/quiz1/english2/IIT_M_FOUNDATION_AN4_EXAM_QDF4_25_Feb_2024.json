Below is a summary of the core topics and concepts:\n\n#### Grammar and Sentence Structure\n1. **Complements**: Parts of a sentence that complete the meaning of the predicate.\n2. **Tenses**: Understanding different tenses such as present perfect, simple past, past perfect, and simple present.\n3. **Adjectival Clauses**: Clauses that function as adjectives to modify nouns.\n4. **Adverbs and Adverbial Clauses**: Words or clauses that modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs.\n5. **Active and Passive Voice**: Understanding how to convert sentences from active to passive voice.\n6. **Sentence Types**: Simple, compound, and complex sentences.\n\n#### Discourse Markers\n1. **Initial Position**: Discourse markers like \"Well,\" \"So,\" and \"Overall\" that start conversations or sentences.\n2. **Middle Position**: Discourse markers like \"I feel like\" and \"in other words\" that connect ideas within a sentence.\n3. **Final Position**: Discourse markers that conclude sentences or ideas.\n4. **Conversational Markers**: Markers used to begin conversations, such as \"So, I wanted to talk to you about something.\"\n\n#### Literary Devices\n1. **Anaphora**: Repetition of a word or phrase at the beginning of successive clauses.\n2. **Metaphor**: Implicit comparison between two unlike things.\n3. **Simile**: Explicit comparison between two unlike things using \"like\" or \"as.\"\n4. **Paradox**: A statement that seems contradictory but may reveal a truth.\n5. **Personification**: Attributing human characteristics to non-human entities.\n6. **Intonation and Stress**: Modulations in speech that convey emotions and meanings.\n\n#### Adjectives and Adverbs\n1. **Adjectives**: Words that describe nouns, often identifiable by specific endings like \"-ical.\"\n2. **Adverbs**: Words that modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs, often ending in \"-ly.\"\n3. **Degree Adverbs**: Adverbs that indicate the degree or extent of an action or state, such as \"really.\"\n\n#### Clauses and Phrases\n1. **Dependent Clauses**: Clauses that cannot stand alone as a sentence.\n2. **Embedded Clauses**: Clauses within a sentence that function as subjects, objects, or complements.\n3. **Relative Pronouns**: Words like \"that\" which introduce relative clauses.\n\n### Knowledge Graph \n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[English Grammar] --> B[Tenses]\n    A --> C[Complements]\n    A --> D[Adjectival Clauses]\n    A --> E[Adverbs and Adverbial Clauses]\n    A --> F[Active and Passive Voice]\n    A --> G[Sentence Types]\n\n    H[Discourse Markers] --> I[Initial Position]\n    H --> J[Middle Position]\n    H --> K[Final Position]\n    H --> L[Conversational Markers]\n\n    M[Literary Devices] --> N[Anaphora]\n    M --> O[Metaphor]\n    M --> P[Simile]\n    M --> Q[Paradox]\n    M --> R[Personification]\n    M --> S[Intonation and Stress]\n\n    T[Adjectives and Adverbs] --> U[Adjectives]\n    T --> V[Adverbs]\n    T --> W[Degree Adverbs]\n\n    X[Clauses and Phrases] --> Y[Dependent Clauses]\n    X --> Z[Embedded Clauses]\n    X --> AA[Relative Pronouns]\n```\n\nThis summary and knowledge graph should help you focus on the essential topics and concepts for your exam.",
