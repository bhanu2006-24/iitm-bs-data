Here are the core topics and concepts you need to study:\n\n#### 1. **Discourse Markers**\n   - **Definition**: Words or phrases that connect ideas and structure discourse.\n   - **Examples**: As a matter of fact, furthermore, truly, however, unless.\n   - **Usage**: Understanding how to use these markers to connect sentences and paragraphs.\n\n#### 2. **Emphasis and Meaning**\n   - **Definition**: How the emphasis on different words in a sentence can change its meaning.\n   - **Examples**: Emphasizing different parts of the sentence \"Did you know that Alex and John are moving to Bombay?\" changes the meaning based on which word is emphasized.\n\n#### 3. **Figures of Speech**\n   - **Irony**: Using words to convey a meaning that is the opposite of its literal meaning.\n   - **Paradox**: A statement that seems contradictory but may be true.\n   - **Oxymoron**: A figure of speech that juxtaposes elements that appear to be contradictory.\n   - **Pun**: A form of word play that suggests two or more meanings.\n   - **Consonance and Assonance**: Repetition of consonant sounds and vowel sounds, respectively.\n\n#### 4. **Adverbs**\n   - **Definition**: Words that modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs.\n   - **Examples**: Often, very, fastly, too, very much.\n   - **Types**: Degree adverbs, comment adverbs.\n   - **Usage**: Understanding how adverbs modify different parts of speech.\n\n#### 5. **Verb Tenses**\n   - **Future Perfect Tense**: Describes an action that will be completed by a certain future time.\n   - **Examples**: \"By next week, I will have finished this painting.\"\n\n#### 6. **Logical/Semantic Roles**\n   - **Agent**: The doer of the action.\n   - **Experiencer**: The one who experiences the action.\n   - **Instrument**: The tool used to perform the action.\n   - **Theme**: The entity undergoing the action.\n\n#### 7. **Passive Voice**\n   - **Definition**: A grammatical voice where the subject receives the action.\n   - **Example**: \"The medal is taken by Sajal.\"\n\n#### 8. **Adjectives**\n   - **Definition**: Words that describe or modify nouns.\n   - **Types**: Attributive, predicative.\n   - **Examples**: \"The Jewish community in Kochi is ancient.\"\n\n#### 9. **Degree Adverbs**\n   - **Definition**: Adverbs that indicate the degree of something.\n   - **Examples**: Very, very much.\n\n#### 10. **Clauses**\n   - **Definition**: Groups of words that contain a subject and a predicate.\n   - **Types**: Relative clauses, adjectival clauses, nominal clauses, adverbial clauses.\n   - **Examples**: \"The dog which has been chasing us has now disappeared.\"\n\n#### 11. **Sentence Structure**\n   - **Simple Sentence**: A single independent clause.\n   - **Compound Sentence**: Two or more independent clauses joined by a coordinating conjunction.\n   - **Complex Sentence**: An independent clause joined by one or more dependent clauses.\n   - **Examples**: \"Rohan resigned and joined a new company.\"\n\n#### 12. **Complements and Adjuncts**\n   - **Complement**: Necessary to complete the meaning of a sentence.\n   - **Adjunct**: Additional information that is not necessary to complete the meaning.\n   - **Examples**: \"I find him intelligent.\" (Complement), \"I\u2019ll come after I have had my breakfast.\" (Adjunct)\n\n### Knowledge Graph \n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[English Grammar] --> B[Discourse Markers];\n    A --> C[Emphasis and Meaning];\n    A --> D[Figures of Speech];\n    A --> E[Adverbs];\n    A --> F[Verb Tenses];\n    A --> G[Logical/Semantic Roles];\n    A --> H[Passive Voice];\n    A --> I[Adjectives];\n    A --> J[Degree Adverbs];\n    A --> K[Clauses];\n    A --> L[Sentence Structure];\n    A --> M[Complements and Adjuncts];\n\n    B --> B1[As a matter of fact];\n    B --> B2[Furthermore];\n    B --> B3[Truly];\n    B --> B4[However];\n    B --> B5[Unless];\n\n    C --> C1[Emphasis on 'you'];\n    C --> C2[Emphasis on 'Alex and John'];\n    C --> C3[Emphasis on 'moving'];\n    C --> C4[Emphasis on 'to'];\n    C --> C5[Emphasis on 'Bombay'];\n\n    D --> D1[Irony];\n    D --> D2[Paradox];\n    D --> D3[Oxymoron];\n    D --> D4[Pun];\n    D --> D5[Consonance and Assonance];\n\n    E --> E1[Often];\n    E --> E2[Very];\n    E --> E3[Fastly];\n    E --> E4[Too];\n    E --> E5[Very much];\n\n    F --> F1[Future Perfect Tense];\n\n    G --> G1[Agent];\n    G --> G2[Experiencer];\n    G --> G3[Instrument];\n    G --> G4[Theme];\n\n    H --> H1[Passive Voice];\n\n    I --> I1[Attributive];\n    I --> I2[Predicative];\n\n    J --> J1[Very];\n    J --> J2[Very much];\n\n    K --> K1[Relative Clauses];\n    K --> K2[Adjectival Clauses];\n    K --> K3[Nominal Clauses];\n    K --> K4[Adverbial Clauses];\n\n    L --> L1[Simple Sentence];\n    L --> L2[Compound Sentence];\n    L --> L3[Complex Sentence];\n\n    M --> M1[Complements];\n    M --> M2[Adjuncts];\n```\n\nThis knowledge graph provides a visual representation of the core topics and their relationships, helping you to understand the structure and focus areas for the exam.",
