**Purpose**: To verify that the modified component works correctly and that other components are not adversely affected by the modification.\n\n2. **Process Maturity Levels**:\n   - **Level 1**: Initial level where processes are ad-hoc and chaotic.\n   - **Level 2**: Repeatable level where basic project management processes are established.\n   - **Level 3**: Defined level where processes are well-documented and standardized.\n   - **Level 4**: Managed level where processes are quantitatively understood and controlled.\n\n3. **Coupling in Software Engineering**:\n   - **Definition**: The degree of interdependence between software modules.\n   - **Types**:\n     - **Common Coupling**: Modules share a common data structure.\n     - **Parameter Coupling**: Modules communicate through parameters.\n     - **Shared Data Coupling**: Modules share global data.\n     - **External Device Coupling**: Modules interact with external devices.\n\n4. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**:\n   - **Back Edges**: Edges that connect a vertex to an ancestor in the depth-first tree.\n   - **Tree Edges**: Edges that are part of the depth-first tree.\n   - **Forward Edges**: Edges that connect a vertex to a descendant in the depth-first tree.\n   - **Cross Edges**: Edges that connect vertices that are not directly related in the depth-first tree.\n\n5. **Finite State Machines (FSM)**:\n   - **Definition**: A mathematical model of computation used to design computer programs and digital logic circuits.\n   - **Components**: States, transitions, and actions.\n   - **Example**: An FSM that accepts strings with an even number of 'a's.\n\n6. **Prime Paths and Test Paths**:\n   - **Prime Paths**: Simple paths in a control flow graph (CFG) that do not contain nested loops or repeated nodes.\n   - **Test Paths**: Paths through a program that are used to test the program's functionality.\n   - **Detour and Sidetrip**: A detour is a deviation from a prime path that does not return to the original path, while a sidetrip is a deviation that returns to the original path.\n\n7. **Control Flow Graph (CFG)**:\n   - **Definition**: A graphical representation of the control flow of a program.\n   - **Components**: Nodes (basic blocks) and edges (control flow paths).\n   - **Example**: A CFG with nodes and edges representing the flow of control in a program.\n\n8. **Cyclomatic Complexity**:\n   - **Definition**: A software metric that provides a quantitative measure of the logical complexity of a program.\n   - **Formula**: \\( V(G) = E - N + 2P \\), where \\( E \\) is the number of edges, \\( N \\) is the number of nodes, and \\( P \\) is the number of connected components.\n\n9. **DU-Pairs and DU-Paths**:\n   - **DU-Pair**: A pair consisting of a definition of a variable and a subsequent use of that variable.\n   - **DU-Path**: A path from a definition of a variable to a use of that variable.\n\n10. **Test Coverage**:\n    - **Node Coverage**: Ensuring that every node in the CFG is executed at least once.\n    - **Edge Coverage**: Ensuring that every edge in the CFG is executed at least once.\n    - **Prime Path Coverage**: Ensuring that every prime path in the CFG is executed at least once.\n\n#### Equations\n\n1. **Cyclomatic Complexity**:\n   \\[\n   V(G) = E - N + 2P\n   \\]\n   - \\( E \\): Number of edges in the CFG.\n   - \\( N \\): Number of nodes in the CFG.\n   - \\( P \\): Number of connected components in the CFG.\n\n2. **DU-Pairs and DU-Paths**:\n   - **DU-Pair**: \\((d, u)\\), where \\(d\\) is a definition of a variable and \\(u\\) is a use of that variable.\n   - **DU-Path**: A path from \\(d\\) to \\(u\\) in the CFG.\n\n### Mermaid Knowledge Graph\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[Software Testing] --> B[Regression Testing];\n    A --> C[Process Maturity Levels];\n    A --> D[Coupling];\n    A --> E[Depth-First Search];\n    A --> F[Finite State Machines];\n    A --> G[Prime Paths and Test Paths];\n    A --> H[Control Flow Graph];\n    A --> I[Cyclomatic Complexity];\n    A --> J[DU-Pairs and DU-Paths];\n    A --> K[Test Coverage];\n\n    B --> B1[Definition];\n    B --> B2[Purpose];\n\n    C --> C1[Level 1];\n    C --> C2[Level 2];\n    C --> C3[Level 3];\n    C --> C4[Level 4];\n\n    D --> D1[Common Coupling];\n    D --> D2[Parameter Coupling];\n    D --> D3[Shared Data Coupling];\n    D --> D4[External Device Coupling];\n\n    E --> E1[Back Edges];\n    E --> E2[Tree Edges];\n    E --> E3[Forward Edges];\n    E --> E4[Cross Edges];\n\n    F --> F1[Definition];\n    F --> F2[Components];\n    F --> F3[Example];\n\n    G --> G1[Prime Paths];\n    G --> G2[Test Paths];\n    G --> G3[Detour and Sidetrip];\n\n    H --> H1[Definition];\n    H --> H2[Components];\n    H --> H3[Example];\n\n    I --> I1[Definition];\n    I --> I2[Formula];\n\n    J --> J1[DU-Pair];\n    J --> J2[DU-Path];\n\n    K --> K1[Node Coverage];\n    K --> K2[Edge Coverage];\n    K --> K3[Prime Path Coverage];\n```\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[Software Testing] --> B[Regression Testing];\n    A --> C[Process Maturity Levels];\n    A --> D[Coupling];\n    A --> E[Depth-First Search];\n    A --> F[Finite State Machines];\n    A --> G[Prime Paths and Test Paths];\n    A --> H[Control Flow Graph];\n    A --> I[Cyclomatic Complexity];\n    A --> J[DU-Pairs and DU-Paths];\n    A --> K[Test Coverage];\n\n    B --> B1[Verify Modified Component];\n    B --> B2[Ensure No New Defects];\n\n    C --> C1[Ad-hoc Processes];\n    C --> C2[Basic Project Management];\n    C --> C3[Well-Documented Processes];\n    C --> C4[Quantitatively Understood Processes];\n\n    D --> D1[Common Coupling];\n    D --> D2[Parameter Coupling];\n    D --> D3[Shared Data Coupling];\n    D --> D4[External Device Coupling];\n\n    E --> E1[Back Edges];\n    E --> E2[Tree Edges];\n    E --> E3[Forward Edges];\n    E --> E4[Cross Edges];\n\n    F --> F1[States];\n    F --> F2[Transitions];\n    F --> F3[Actions];\n\n    G --> G1[Simple Paths];\n    G --> G2[Test Paths];\n    G --> G3[Detour and Sidetrip];\n\n    H --> H1[Nodes];\n    H --> H2[Edges];\n    H --> H3[Control Flow];\n\n    I --> I1[Quantitative Measure];\n    I --> I2[V(G) = E -
