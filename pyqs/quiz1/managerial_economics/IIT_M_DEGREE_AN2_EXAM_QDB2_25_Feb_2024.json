Production Functions\n- **Cobb-Douglas Production Function**: \\( F(K, L) = K^p L^q \\)\n  - **Returns to Scale**:\n    - Increasing returns to scale: \\( p + q > 1 \\)\n    - Constant returns to scale: \\( p + q = 1 \\)\n    - Decreasing returns to scale: \\( p + q < 1 \\)\n\n#### 2. Preferences and Utility\n- **Completeness**: The ability to compare and choose between different goods.\n- **Reflexivity**: A good is at least as good as itself.\n- **Transitivity**: If a person prefers A to B and B to C, then they should prefer A to C.\n- **Convexity**: Preferences are convex if the consumer prefers diversity to extremes.\n\n#### 3. Marginal Product of Labor\n- **Definition**: The extra output produced by employing one more unit of labor while holding other inputs constant.\n- **Equation**: \\( MP_L = \\frac{\\Delta Q}{\\Delta L} \\)\n\n#### 4. Cost Minimization\n- **Marginal Cost (MC)**: The cost of producing one more unit of a good.\n- **Average Total Cost (ATC)**: Total cost divided by the number of units produced.\n- **Condition for Cost Minimization**: \\( MC = ATC \\)\n- **Optimal Combination of Inputs**: Minimizing cost given the prices of inputs and the production function.\n\n#### 5. Cost Functions\n- **Total Cost (TC)**: \\( TC = 100 + 25q + q^2 \\)\n- **Average Fixed Cost (AFC)**: \\( \\frac{FC}{q} \\)\n- **Marginal Cost (MC)**: \\( \\frac{d(TC)}{dq} \\)\n- **Average Variable Cost (AVC)**: \\( \\frac{VC}{q} \\)\n\n#### 6. Opportunity Cost\n- **Definition**: The cost of forgoing the next best alternative when making a decision.\n- **Example**: The cost of selling goods to one buyer over another.\n\n### Knowledge Graph \n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[Managerial Economics] --> B[Production Functions]\n    A --> C[Preferences and Utility]\n    A --> D[Marginal Product of Labor]\n    A --> E[Cost Minimization]\n    A --> F[Cost Functions]\n    A --> G[Opportunity Cost]\n\n    B --> B1[Cobb-Douglas Production Function]\n    B --> B2[Returns to Scale]\n\n    C --> C1[Completeness]\n    C --> C2[Reflexivity]\n    C --> C3[Transitivity]\n    C --> C4[Convexity]\n\n    D --> D1[Definition]\n    D --> D2[Equation]\n\n    E --> E1[Marginal Cost]\n    E --> E2[Average Total Cost]\n    E --> E3[Condition for Cost Minimization]\n    E --> E4[Optimal Combination of Inputs]\n\n    F --> F1[Total Cost]\n    F --> F2[Average Fixed Cost]\n    F --> F3[Marginal Cost]\n    F --> F4[Average Variable Cost]\n\n    G --> G1[Definition]\n    G --> G2[Example]\n```\n\nThis summary and knowledge graph should help you understand the core topics and their relationships for the exam on Managerial Economics.",
