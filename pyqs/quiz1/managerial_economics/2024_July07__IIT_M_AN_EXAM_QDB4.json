Production Functions\n- **Definition**: Mathematical representations of the relationship between inputs (factors of production) and outputs.\n- **Types**:\n  - **Cobb-Douglas Production Function**: \\( q = A L^\\alpha K^\\beta \\)\n  - **Leontief Production Function**: \\( q = \\min(aL, bK) \\)\n  - **Linear Production Function**: \\( q = aL + bK \\)\n\n#### 2. Marginal Product of Labor (MPL) and Marginal Product of Capital (MPK)\n- **Definition**: The additional output produced by employing one more unit of labor (MPL) or capital (MPK) while holding other inputs constant.\n- **Formulas**:\n  - \\( MPL = \\frac{\\partial q}{\\partial L} \\)\n  - \\( MPK = \\frac{\\partial q}{\\partial K} \\)\n\n#### 3. Cost Minimization\n- **Condition**: The cost-minimizing combination of inputs occurs where the ratio of marginal products equals the ratio of input prices.\n- **Formula**: \\( \\frac{MPL}{MPK} = \\frac{w}{r} \\)\n  - \\( w \\): Wage rate (cost of labor)\n  - \\( r \\): Rental rate (cost of capital)\n\n#### 4. Cost Functions\n- **Total Cost (TC)**: \\( TC = FC + VC \\)\n  - \\( FC \\): Fixed Cost\n  - \\( VC \\): Variable Cost\n- **Average Total Cost (ATC)**: \\( ATC = \\frac{TC}{q} \\)\n- **Marginal Cost (MC)**: \\( MC = \\frac{\\partial TC}{\\partial q} \\)\n\n#### 5. Budget Line\n- **Definition**: Represents all combinations of two goods that a consumer can afford given their income and the prices of the goods.\n- **Slope**: \\( -\\frac{P_x}{P_y} \\)\n  - \\( P_x \\): Price of good X\n  - \\( P_y \\): Price of good Y\n- **Intercepts**:\n  - X-intercept: \\( \\frac{I}{P_x} \\)\n  - Y-intercept: \\( \\frac{I}{P_y} \\)\n  - \\( I \\): Income\n\n#### 6. Opportunity Cost\n- **Definition**: The cost of forgoing the next best alternative when making a decision.\n- **Formula**: Opportunity Cost = Return of the best alternative forgone\n\n### Knowledge Graph \n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[Managerial Economics] --> B[Production Functions];\n    A --> C[Cost Functions];\n    A --> D[Budget Line];\n    A --> E[Opportunity Cost];\n\n    B --> B1[Cobb-Douglas];\n    B --> B2[Leontief];\n    B --> B3[Linear];\n\n    C --> C1[Total Cost];\n    C --> C2[Average Total Cost];\n    C --> C3[Marginal Cost];\n\n    D --> D1[Slope];\n    D --> D2[Intercepts];\n\n    E --> E1[Definition];\n    E --> E2[Formula];\n```\n\n### Additional Knowledge Graph for Production and Cost Concepts\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    ProductionFunctions --> MPL;\n    ProductionFunctions --> MPK;\n    MPL --> CostMinimization;\n    MPK --> CostMinimization;\n    CostMinimization --> CostFunctions;\n    CostFunctions --> TC;\n    CostFunctions --> ATC;\n    CostFunctions --> MC;\n```\n\nThis summary and the knowledge graphs should help you understand the core topics and their relationships, making it easier to prepare for the exam.",
