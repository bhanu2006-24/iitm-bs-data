Students send you orders for snacks, such as potato chips and candy bars, via the Internet. You shop at local grocery stores to fill these orders and then deliver the orders. To operate this business, you pay $500 a month to lease computer time from a local Web-hosting company to use its server to host and maintain your website. You also own a sports utility vehicle (SUV) that you use to make deliveries. Your monthly car payment is $300, and you pay $100 a month in insurance costs. Each order that you fill takes, on average, a half hour and consumes $0.50 worth of gasoline. When you fill an order, you pay the grocer for the merchandise. You then collect a payment, including a delivery fee, from the students to whom you sell. If you did not operate this business, you could work at the campus dining hall, earning $6 an hour. Right now, you operate your business five days a week, Monday through Friday. On weekends, your business is idle, and you work in the campus dining hall. \nBased on the above data, answer the given subquestions.",

Students send you orders for snacks, such as potato chips and candy bars, via the Internet. You shop at local grocery stores to fill these orders and then deliver the orders. To operate this business, you pay $500 a month to lease computer time from a local Web-hosting company to use its server to host and maintain your website. You also own a sports utility vehicle (SUV) that you use to make deliveries. Your monthly car payment is $300, and you pay $100 a month in insurance costs. Each order that you fill takes, on average, a half hour and consumes $0.50 worth of gasoline. When you fill an order, you pay the grocer for the merchandise. You then collect a payment, including a delivery fee, from the students to whom you sell. If you did not operate this business, you could work at the campus dining hall, earning $6 an hour. Right now, you operate your business five days a week, Monday through Friday.

Students send you orders for snacks, such as potato chips and candy bars, via the Internet. You shop at local grocery stores to fill these orders and then deliver the orders. To operate this business, you pay $500 a month to lease computer time from a local Web-hosting company to use its server to host and maintain your website. You also own a sports utility vehicle (SUV) that you use to make deliveries. Your monthly car payment is $300, and you pay $100 a month in insurance costs. Each order that you fill takes, on average, a half hour and consumes $0.50 worth of gasoline. When you fill an order, you pay the grocer for the merchandise. You then collect a payment, including a delivery fee, from the students to whom you sell. If you did not operate this business, you could work at the campus dining hall, earning $6 an hour.

        "summary": "### Summary of Core Topics and Concepts\n\n#### 1. **Costs in Business**\n- **Explicit Costs**: Direct payments made to others in the course of running a business, such as wages, rent, and materials.\n  - Example: Leasing computer time, gasoline, payments to grocers.\n- **Implicit Costs**: Opportunity costs of using resources that the business already owns.\n  - Example: Wage forgone by not working at the campus dining hall.\n- **Opportunity Cost**: The cost of the next best alternative use of a resource.\n  - Example: The cost of selling Fritos to the fraternity instead of returning them to the grocer.\n\n#### 2. **Utility Function**\n- **Utility Function**: A function that represents the satisfaction a consumer gets from consuming a bundle of goods.\n  - Example: \\( U(x, y) = y \\sqrt{x} \\)\n- **Marginal Utility**: The additional satisfaction from consuming one more unit of a good.\n  - Diminishing Marginal Utility: The principle that as more of a good is consumed, the additional satisfaction from each additional unit decreases.\n\n#### 3. **Production Function**\n- **Production Function**: A function that relates the quantity of output produced to the quantities of inputs used.\n  - Example: \\( Q = 50 \\sqrt{LK} \\), \\( Q = 5L + 2K \\)\n- **Marginal Product of Labor (MPL)**: The additional output produced by employing one more unit of labor.\n- **Marginal Product of Capital (MPK)**: The additional output produced by employing one more unit of capital.\n\n#### 4. **Cost Minimization**\n- **Cost Minimization**: The process of finding the combination of inputs that produces a given level of output at the lowest possible cost.\n  - Example: Finding the cost-minimizing input combination for producing 1,000 units per year.\n\n#### 5. **Short-Run Cost Function**\n- **Total Cost (TC)**: The sum of fixed costs and variable costs.\n  - Example: \\( TC = 300 + 50q + q^2 \\)\n- **Average Fixed Cost (AFC)**: Fixed costs divided by the quantity of output.\n- **Marginal Cost (MC)**: The additional cost of producing one more unit of output.\n- **Average Variable Cost (AVC)**: Variable costs divided by the quantity of output.\n\n#### 6. **Returns to Scale**\n- **Returns to Scale**: The rate at which output increases when all inputs are increased proportionally.\n  - Constant Returns to Scale: Output increases at the same rate as inputs.\n  - Decreasing Returns to Scale: Output increases at a slower rate than inputs.\n  - Increasing Returns to Scale: Output increases at a faster rate than inputs.\n\n### Important Equations\n\n#### Utility Function\n\\[ U(x, y) = y \\sqrt{x} \\]\n\n#### Production Functions\n\\[ Q = 50 \\sqrt{LK} \\]\n\\[ Q = 5L + 2K \\]\n\n#### Short-Run Cost Function\n\\[ TC = 300 + 50q + q^2 \\]\n\n#### Cobb-Douglas Production Function\n\\[ F(K, L) = K^p L^q \\]\n\n### Key Principles\n\n1. **Explicit vs. Implicit Costs**: Understanding the difference between direct payments and opportunity costs.\n2. **Opportunity Cost**: Evaluating the cost of the next best alternative.\n3. **Marginal Utility**: Understanding how additional consumption affects total satisfaction.\n4. **Production Functions**: Relating inputs to outputs and understanding marginal products.\n5. **Cost Minimization**: Finding the optimal combination of inputs to minimize costs.\n6. **Cost Functions**: Calculating total, average, and marginal costs.\n7. **Returns to Scale**: Understanding how output changes with proportional changes in inputs.\n\n### Knowledge Graph \n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[Managerial Economics] --> B[Costs in Business];\n    A --> C[Utility Function];\n    A --> D[Production Function];\n    A --> E[Cost Minimization];\n    A --> F[Short-Run Cost Function];\n    A --> G[Returns to Scale];\n\n    B --> B1[Explicit Costs];\n    B --> B2[Implicit Costs];\n    B --> B3[Opportunity Cost];\n\n    C --> C1[Utility Function];\n    C --> C2[Marginal Utility];\n\n    D --> D1[Production Function];\n    D --> D2[Marginal Product of Labor];\n    D --> D3[Marginal Product of Capital];\n\n    E --> E1[Cost Minimization];\n\n    F --> F1[Total Cost];\n    F --> F2[Average Fixed Cost];\n    F --> F3[Marginal Cost];\n    F --> F4[Average Variable Cost];\n\n    G --> G1[Constant Returns to Scale];\n    G --> G2[Decreasing Returns to Scale];\n    G --> G3[Increasing Returns to Scale];\n```\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    C[Utility Function] --> C1[Utility Function: U(x, y) = y\u221ax];\n    C --> C2[Marginal Utility];\n\n    D[Production Function] --> D1[Production Function: Q = 50\u221a(LK)];\n    D --> D2[Production Function: Q = 5L + 2K];\n    D --> D3[Marginal Product of Labor];\n    D --> D4[Marginal Product of Capital];\n\n    F[Short-Run Cost Function] --> F1[Total Cost: TC = 300 + 50q + q^2];\n    F --> F2[Average Fixed Cost];\n    F --> F3[Marginal Cost];\n    F --> F4[Average Variable Cost];\n\n    G[Returns to Scale] --> G1[Cobb-Douglas Production Function: F(K, L) = K^p L^q];\n    G --> G2[Constant Returns to Scale: p + q = 1];\n```\n\nThis summary and knowledge graph should help you understand the core topics, concepts, principles, and equations essential for the exam.",
