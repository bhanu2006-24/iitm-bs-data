Students send you orders for snacks, such as potato chips and candy bars, via the Internet. You shop at local grocery stores to fill these orders and then deliver the orders. To operate this business, you pay $500 a month to lease computer time from a local Web-hosting company to use its server to host and maintain your website. You also own a sports utility vehicle (SUV) that you use to make deliveries. Your monthly car payment is $300, and you pay $100 a month in insurance costs. Each order that you fill takes, on average, a half hour and consumes $0.50 worth of gasoline. When you fill an order, you pay the grocer for the merchandise. You then collect a payment, including a delivery fee, from the students to whom you sell. If you did not operate this business, you could work at the campus dining hall, earning $6 an hour. Right now, you operate your business five days a week, Monday through Friday. On weekends, your business is idle, and you work in the campus dining hall. \nBased on the above data, answer the given subquestions.",

Students send you orders for snacks, such as potato chips and candy bars, via the Internet. You shop at local grocery stores to fill these orders and then deliver the orders. To operate this business, you pay $500 a month to lease computer time from a local Web-hosting company to use its server to host and maintain your website. You also own a sports utility vehicle (SUV) that you use to make deliveries. Your monthly car payment is $300, and you pay $100 a month in insurance costs. Each order that you fill takes, on average, a half hour and consumes $0.50 worth of gasoline. When you fill an order, you pay the grocer for the merchandise. You then collect a payment, including a delivery fee, from the students to whom you sell. If you did not operate this business, you could work at the campus dining hall, earning $6 an hour. Right now, you operate your business five days a week, Monday through Friday.

You also own a sports utility vehicle (SUV) that you use to make deliveries. Your monthly car payment is $300, and you pay $100 a month in insurance costs. Each order that you fill takes, on average, a half hour and consumes $0.50 worth of gasoline. When you fill an order, you pay the grocer for the merchandise. You then collect a payment, including a delivery fee, from the students to whom you sell. If you did not operate this business, you could work at the campus dining hall, earning $6 an hour.

        "summary": "### Summary of Core Topics and Concepts\n\nThe exam covers several key topics in Managerial Economics, focusing on both theoretical concepts and practical applications. Here are the core topics, concepts, principles, and equations essential for the exam:\n\n#### 1. **Costs in Business**\n   - **Explicit Costs**: Direct payments made to others for resources, such as leasing computer time, gasoline, and payments to grocers.\n   - **Implicit Costs**: Opportunity costs of using resources owned by the firm, such as the wage you could earn elsewhere.\n   - **Opportunity Cost**: The cost of the next best alternative, e.g., the cost of not selling the Fritos to the fraternity.\n\n#### 2. **Utility Function**\n   - **Utility Function**: \\( U(x, y) = y \\sqrt{x} \\)\n   - **Marginal Utility**: The additional satisfaction gained from consuming one more unit of a good.\n   - **Diminishing Marginal Utility**: The principle that as consumption of a good increases, the additional satisfaction from each additional unit decreases.\n\n#### 3. **Production Function**\n   - **Production Function**: \\( Q = 50 \\sqrt{LK} \\)\n   - **Cost-Minimizing Input Combination**: Finding the optimal combination of labor (L) and capital (K) to minimize costs.\n   - **Marginal Product of Labor (MPL)**: The additional output produced by one additional unit of labor.\n   - **Marginal Product of Capital (MPK)**: The additional output produced by one additional unit of capital.\n\n#### 4. **Cost Function**\n   - **Total Cost (TC)**: \\( TC = 300 + 50q + q^2 \\)\n   - **Average Fixed Cost (AFC)**: Fixed costs divided by the number of units produced.\n   - **Marginal Cost (MC)**: The cost of producing one additional unit of output.\n   - **Average Variable Cost (AVC)**: Variable costs divided by the number of units produced.\n\n#### 5. **Returns to Scale**\n   - **Cobb-Douglas Production Function**: \\( F(K, L) = K^p L^q \\)\n   - **Constant Returns to Scale**: If \\( p + q = 1 \\), the production function exhibits constant returns to scale.\n   - **Decreasing Returns to Scale**: If \\( p + q < 1 \\), the production function exhibits decreasing returns to scale.\n   - **Increasing Returns to Scale**: If \\( p + q > 1 \\), the production function exhibits increasing returns to scale.\n\n#### 6. **Marginal and Average Product Relationships**\n   - **Marginal Product (MP)**: The additional output produced by one additional unit of input.\n   - **Average Product (AP)**: The total output divided by the number of units of input.\n   - **Relationship**: When AP is increasing, MP is greater than AP. When AP is decreasing, MP is less than AP. When AP is at its maximum, MP equals AP.\n\n### Knowledge Graph \n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[Managerial Economics] --> B[Costs in Business];\n    A --> C[Utility Function];\n    A --> D[Production Function];\n    A --> E[Cost Function];\n    A --> F[Returns to Scale];\n    A --> G[Marginal and Average Product Relationships];\n\n    B --> B1[Explicit Costs];\n    B --> B2[Implicit Costs];\n    B --> B3[Opportunity Cost];\n\n    C --> C1[Utility Function: U(x, y) = y\u221ax];\n    C --> C2[Marginal Utility];\n    C --> C3[Diminishing Marginal Utility];\n\n    D --> D1[Production Function: Q = 50\u221a(LK)];\n    D --> D2[Cost-Minimizing Input Combination];\n    D --> D3[Marginal Product of Labor];\n    D --> D4[Marginal Product of Capital];\n\n    E --> E1[Total Cost: TC = 300 + 50q + q\u00b2];\n    E --> E2[Average Fixed Cost];\n    E --> E3[Marginal Cost];\n    E --> E4[Average Variable Cost];\n\n    F --> F1[Cobb-Douglas Production Function: F(K, L) = K^p L^q];\n    F --> F2[Constant Returns to Scale];\n    F --> F3[Decreasing Returns to Scale];\n    F --> F4[Increasing Returns to Scale];\n\n    G --> G1[Marginal Product];\n    G --> G2[Average Product];\n    G --> G3[Relationship between MP and AP];\n```\n\nThis summary and knowledge graph should help you understand the core topics and their relationships, making it easier to prepare for the exam.",
