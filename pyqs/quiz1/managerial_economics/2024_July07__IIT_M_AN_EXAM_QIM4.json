Production Functions\n- **Definition**: A production function relates the quantity of output produced to the quantities of inputs used.\n- **Types**:\n  - **Cobb-Douglas Production Function**: \\( q = AL^aK^b \\)\n  - **Leontief Production Function**: \\( q = \\min(aL, bK) \\)\n  - **Linear Production Function**: \\( q = aL + bK \\)\n\n#### 2. Marginal Products\n- **Marginal Product of Labour (MPL)**: The extra output produced by employing one more unit of labour while holding other inputs constant.\n  - \\( MPL = \\frac{\\partial q}{\\partial L} \\)\n- **Marginal Product of Capital (MPK)**: The extra output produced by employing one more unit of capital while holding other inputs constant.\n  - \\( MPK = \\frac{\\partial q}{\\partial K} \\)\n\n#### 3. Cost Minimization\n- **Cost Function**: \\( TC = wL + rK \\)\n- **Cost Minimization Condition**: \\( \\frac{MPL}{w} = \\frac{MPK}{r} \\)\n- **Example**: For \\( q = 10L^{1/2}K^{1/2} \\), \\( w = 20 \\), \\( r = 80 \\), and \\( q = 100 \\), the cost-minimizing quantities are \\( L = 20 \\) and \\( K = 5 \\).\n\n#### 4. Budget Line\n- **Equation**: \\( P_c C + P_f F = I \\)\n- **Slope**: \\( -\\frac{P_c}{P_f} \\)\n- **Intercepts**:\n  - X-intercept: \\( \\frac{I}{P_c} \\)\n  - Y-intercept: \\( \\frac{I}{P_f} \\)\n\n#### 5. Opportunity Cost\n- **Definition**: The cost of forgoing the next best alternative.\n- **Example**: Selling Fritos to a fraternity instead of returning them to the grocer.\n\n#### 6. Marginal Rate of Technical Substitution (MRTS)\n- **Definition**: The rate at which one input can be substituted for another input without changing the level of output.\n  - \\( MRTS = -\\frac{MP_L}{MP_K} \\)\n\n### Knowledge Graph \n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[Production Functions] --> B[Cobb-Douglas];\n    A --> C[Leontief];\n    A --> D[Linear];\n    B --> E[q = AL^aK^b];\n    C --> F[q = min(aL, bK)];\n    D --> G[q = aL + bK];\n    H[Marginal Products] --> I[MPL];\n    H --> J[MPK];\n    I --> K[\u2202q/\u2202L];\n    J --> L[\u2202q/\u2202K];\n    M[Cost Minimization] --> N[TC = wL + rK];\n    M --> O[MPL/w = MPK/r];\n    P[Budget Line] --> Q[P_c C + P_f F = I];\n    P --> R[Slope = -P_c/P_f];\n    P --> S[X-intercept = I/P_c];\n    P --> T[Y-intercept = I/P_f];\n    U[Opportunity Cost] --> V[Cost of forgoing next best alternative];\n    W[MRTS] --> X[-MP_L/MP_K];\n```\n\n### Additional Knowledge Graph for Specific Examples\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    Y[Example: q = 10L^{1/2}K^{1/2}] --> Z[w = 20, r = 80, q = 100];\n    Z --> AA[L = 20, K = 5];\n    AB[Example: Budget Line] --> AC[P_c = 20, P_f = 10, I = 1000];\n    AC --> AD[Slope = -2];\n    AC --> AE[X-intercept = 50];\n    AC --> AF[Y-intercept = 100];\n    AG[Example: MRTS] --> AH[MP_L = 50, MRTS = 1/4];\n    AH --> AI[MP_K = 200];\n```\n\nThis summary and the knowledge graphs should help you understand the core topics and their relationships, making it easier to prepare for the exam.",
