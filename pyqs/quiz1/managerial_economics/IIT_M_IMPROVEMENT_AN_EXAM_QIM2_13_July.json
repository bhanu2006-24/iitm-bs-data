Students send you orders for snacks, such as potato chips and candy bars, via the Internet. You shop at local grocery stores to fill these orders and then deliver the orders. To operate this business, you pay $500 a month to lease computer time from a local Web-hosting company to use its server to host and maintain your website. You also own a sports utility vehicle (SUV) that you use to make deliveries. Your monthly car payment is $300, and you pay $100 a month in insurance costs. Each order that you fill takes, on average, a half hour and consumes $0.50 worth of gasoline. When you fill an order, you pay the grocer for the merchandise. You then collect a payment, including a delivery fee, from the students to whom you sell. If you did not operate this business, you could work at the campus dining hall, earning $6 an hour. Right now, you operate your business five days a week, Monday through Friday. On weekends, your business is idle, and you work in the campus dining hall. \nBased on the above data, answer the given subquestions.",

Students send you orders for snacks, such as potato chips and candy bars, via the Internet. You shop at local grocery stores to fill these orders and then deliver the orders. To operate this business, you pay $500 a month to lease computer time from a local Web-hosting company to use its server to host and maintain your website. You also own a sports utility vehicle (SUV) that you use to make deliveries. Your monthly car payment is $300, and you pay $100 a month in insurance costs. Each order that you fill takes, on average, a half hour and consumes $0.50 worth of gasoline. When you fill an order, you pay the grocer for the merchandise. You then collect a payment, including a delivery fee, from the students to whom you sell. If you did not operate this business, you could work at the campus dining hall, earning $6 an hour. Right now, you operate your business five days a week, Monday through Friday.

Students send you orders for snacks, such as potato chips and candy bars, via the Internet. You shop at local grocery stores to fill these orders and then deliver the orders. To operate this business, you pay $500 a month to lease computer time from a local Web-hosting company to use its server to host and maintain your website. You also own a sports utility vehicle (SUV) that you use to make deliveries. Your monthly car payment is $300, and you pay $100 a month in insurance costs. Each order that you fill takes, on average, a half hour and consumes $0.50 worth of gasoline. When you fill an order, you pay the grocer for the merchandise. You then collect a payment, including a delivery fee, from the students to whom you sell. If you did not operate this business, you could work at the campus dining hall, earning $6 an hour.

        "summary": "### Summary of Core Topics and Concepts\n\nThe exam covers several key topics in Managerial Economics, focusing on both theoretical concepts and practical applications. Here are the core topics, concepts, principles, and equations essential for the exam:\n\n#### 1. **Cost Concepts**\n- **Explicit Costs**: Direct payments made to others for the use of resources (e.g., leasing computer time, gasoline, payments to grocers).\n- **Implicit Costs**: Opportunity costs of using resources owned by the firm (e.g., wages forgone by not working elsewhere).\n- **Opportunity Cost**: The cost of the next best alternative foregone (e.g., selling Fritos to the fraternity).\n\n#### 2. **Utility Function**\n- **Utility Function**: \\( U(x, y) = y \\sqrt{x} \\)\n- **Marginal Utility**: The additional satisfaction gained from consuming one more unit of a good.\n- **Diminishing Marginal Utility**: The principle that as more of a good is consumed, the additional satisfaction from each additional unit decreases.\n\n#### 3. **Production Function**\n- **Cobb-Douglas Production Function**: \\( Q = 50 \\sqrt{LK} \\)\n- **Linear Production Function**: \\( Q = 5L + 2K \\)\n- **Marginal Product of Labor (MPL)**: The additional output produced by one additional unit of labor.\n- **Marginal Product of Capital (MPK)**: The additional output produced by one additional unit of capital.\n\n#### 4. **Cost Minimization**\n- **Cost Function**: \\( TC = 300 + 50q + q^2 \\)\n- **Average Fixed Cost (AFC)**: Fixed costs divided by the number of units produced.\n- **Marginal Cost (MC)**: The change in total cost from producing one additional unit.\n- **Average Variable Cost (AVC)**: Variable costs divided by the number of units produced.\n\n#### 5. **Returns to Scale**\n- **Constant Returns to Scale**: When increasing all inputs by a certain proportion results in the same proportion increase in output (e.g., Cobb-Douglas production function with \\( p + q = 1 \\)).\n- **Decreasing Returns to Scale**: When increasing all inputs by a certain proportion results in a less than proportional increase in output.\n- **Increasing Returns to Scale**: When increasing all inputs by a certain proportion results in a more than proportional increase in output.\n\n### Important Equations\n\n1. **Utility Function**:\n   \\[ U(x, y) = y \\sqrt{x} \\]\n\n2. **Cobb-Douglas Production Function**:\n   \\[ Q = 50 \\sqrt{LK} \\]\n\n3. **Linear Production Function**:\n   \\[ Q = 5L + 2K \\]\n\n4. **Cost Function**:\n   \\[ TC = 300 + 50q + q^2 \\]\n\n5. **Marginal Product of Labor (MPL)**:\n   \\[ MPL = \\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial L} \\]\n\n6. **Marginal Product of Capital (MPK)**:\n   \\[ MPK = \\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial K} \\]\n\n7. **Average Fixed Cost (AFC)**:\n   \\[ AFC = \\frac{FC}{q} \\]\n\n8. **Marginal Cost (MC)**:\n   \\[ MC = \\frac{\\partial TC}{\\partial q} \\]\n\n9. **Average Variable Cost (AVC)**:\n   \\[ AVC = \\frac{VC}{q} \\]\n\n### Knowledge Graph \n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[Managerial Economics] --> B[Cost Concepts];\n    A --> C[Utility Function];\n    A --> D[Production Function];\n    A --> E[Cost Minimization];\n    A --> F[Returns to Scale];\n\n    B --> B1[Explicit Costs];\n    B --> B2[Implicit Costs];\n    B --> B3[Opportunity Cost];\n\n    C --> C1[Utility Function: U(x, y) = y\u221ax];\n    C --> C2[Marginal Utility];\n    C --> C3[Diminishing Marginal Utility];\n\n    D --> D1[Cobb-Douglas Production Function: Q = 50\u221a(LK)];\n    D --> D2[Linear Production Function: Q = 5L + 2K];\n    D --> D3[Marginal Product of Labor: MPL];\n    D --> D4[Marginal Product of Capital: MPK];\n\n    E --> E1[Cost Function: TC = 300 + 50q + q\u00b2];\n    E --> E2[Average Fixed Cost: AFC];\n    E --> E3[Marginal Cost: MC];\n    E --> E4[Average Variable Cost: AVC];\n\n    F --> F1[Constant Returns to Scale];\n    F --> F2[Decreasing Returns to Scale];\n    F --> F3[Increasing Returns to Scale];\n```\n\nThis summary and knowledge graph should help you focus on the essential topics and understand the relationships between them for your Managerial Economics exam.",
